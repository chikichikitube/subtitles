1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
It's a good thing I'm here.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I'm here!

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I'm here!

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I'm here!

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm here!

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I'm here!

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I'm here!

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Please, say something.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
What is this costume?

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
What is this?

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
What is this?

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
This is not what I was thinking.

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
What is this?

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Wait a minute.

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
This is weird.

16
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The theme is...

17
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Is this a 8th grade program?

18
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
What is this?

19
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
What is this?

20
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I have to play a game.

21
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Today, we are going to do a program called,

22
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Please, say something.

23
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
We are doing a program called,

24
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Please, say something.

25
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
We are doing a program called,

26
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Please, say something.

27
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
This is cool.

28
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
This is weird.

29
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
What is this?

30
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I really like this.

31
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
This is cool.

32
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
This is frustrating!

33
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
So,

34
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I will be the first one to answer.

35
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
You will ask a question.

36
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
So, let's ask a question.

37
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I will ask a question.

38
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I will ask the first question.

39
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I will ask the first question.

40
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I will ask the first question.

41
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
There are 5 comedians that you hate.

42
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
There are 5 comedians that you hate.

43
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
If you can find 5 comedians in time,

44
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
you will be amazing.

45
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Are you a comedian?

46
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Start!

47
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Here it comes!

48
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Yasushi!

49
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Mikaku!

50
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Here it comes!

51
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Sanshi!

52
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Here it comes!

53
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Kosei Midori!

54
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Marianne!

55
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Here it comes!

56
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Nozawa!

57
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Monoko!

58
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Here it comes!

59
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Wait a minute.

60
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Do you hate Mikako?

61
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
No, I don't hate her.

62
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
No, I don't hate her.

63
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I think you hate her.

64
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I don't hate her.

65
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I don't hate her.

66
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
But there was a situation like this.

67
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Let's say you are me.

68
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Let's say you are me.

69
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I was at my debut.

70
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I am Dantan Matsumoto.

71
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
There were only two of us in the hallway.

72
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
There was no one else.

73
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
And we met in the morning.

74
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I am Mikaku.

75
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I am Dantan Matsumoto.

76
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
There was a situation like this.

77
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
But I didn't hate her or anything like that.

78
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
But I didn't hate her or anything like that.

79
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
But there was a situation like this.

80
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
That's all I wanted to say to everyone in the Kanto region.

81
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:24,000
That's all I wanted to say to everyone in the Kanto region.

82
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
All right.

83
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
How do you answer these questions?

84
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
What kind of matter is this...

85
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Okay.

86
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
What kind of matter is this...

87
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:46,800
ashes throughout the farm never

88
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:50,100
smoke.

89
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:54,100
Hajimaru

90
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:58,100
Most of them are about the body

91
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:00,100
What?

92
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:02,100
Makijita

93
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:05,100
Miken Nishihara

94
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:07,100
What?

95
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,100
No

96
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:09,100
2 points

97
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:11,100
Isn't it easy?

98
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:13,100
Shitauchi

99
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:15,100
This is easy

100
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:16,100
Isn't it?

101
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:20,100
This guy's lower body is amazing

102
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:23,100
Normally, when you are hungry, you lower your body

103
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:27,100
This guy is different

104
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,100
Isn't it?

105
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:31,100
Isn't it?

106
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:33,100
Let's go to the next one

107
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:37,100
The next question is

108
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:43,100
Matsumoto's favorite type of woman

109
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:46,100
Let's start

110
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:48,100
Kikuchi Momoko

111
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,100
Kuro Yuki

112
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:53,100
Stop talking

113
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:56,100
I'm talking about Kuroki Hitomi

114
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:58,100
What?

115
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:00,100
Towa Yuki

116
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:03,100
What?

117
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:07,100
Who is it?

118
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,100
Morita

119
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,100
That's right

120
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:13,100
And...

121
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:15,100
Misako Konno

122
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:17,100
Misako Konno

123
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,100
What?

124
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,100
Let's see

125
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,100
I know Misako

126
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:25,100
What's this?

127
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:29,100
Hinomi

128
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:31,100
One more

129
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,100
What's the last one?

130
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:34,100
Stop joking

131
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:40,100
This is my favorite type of woman

132
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:43,100
I'm talking about her

133
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:45,100
The last question

134
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:48,100
This is a question

135
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:51,100
What shows do you want to quit?

136
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,100
Regular, of course

137
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:54,100
Of course

138
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:57,100
What shows do you want to quit?

139
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,100
5

140
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,100
5?

141
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:03,100
You have 7 regular shows

142
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:05,100
In Osaka and Tokyo

143
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:08,100
It's almost 5

144
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,100
It's 5

145
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:12,100
Let's start

146
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:17,100
Dance, dance, dance

147
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:19,100
Let's see

148
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,100
What is it?

149
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:23,100
Yantan

150
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:26,100
Let's see

151
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:29,100
If it's not Yume

152
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:32,100
Iitomo

153
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:36,100
Gaki no Kikai

154
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:39,100
It's a show

155
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:40,100
What is it?

156
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,100
I don't know

157
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:45,100
It's the same as Izumi

158
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:47,100
Dance, dance, dance

159
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,100
That's right

160
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:51,100
Let's see

161
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:53,100
Dance, dance, dance

162
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,100
That's it

163
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:57,100
Let's see

164
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:06,100
Ladies and gentlemen

165
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:08,100
Thank you

166
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,100
Well

167
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:14,100
Hamada-kun is late today

168
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:18,100
The talent is to buy the clothes

169
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:20,100
If you like it, you can buy it

170
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:22,100
I really want it

171
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:28,100
Hamada-kun likes today's clothes

172
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:33,100
It's his fashion

173
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:36,100
Hamada-kun

174
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:47,100
It's cute

175
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:50,100
It's amazing

176
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:52,100
It's cute

177
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:56,100
The sleeves are the same

178
00:07:56,100 --> 00:08:01,100
Where is the ray gun?

179
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:06,100
No matter how cute it is, I want to be like this

180
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:11,100
The show is starting

181
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:14,100
It's a dress

182
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:24,100
It's quite expensive

183
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:28,100
Well, today

184
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:32,100
It's a great hat

185
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:36,100
How is it?

186
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:42,100
This is the hat I prepared because I thought you liked hats

187
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:44,100
What is this?

188
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:46,100
It opens like this

189
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,100
Oh

190
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:50,100
Is it okay?

191
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,100
It's the best

192
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:56,100
It's really the best

193
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:59,100
I can't stop

194
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,100
I'll do my best today

195
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:03,100
I'm a little dizzy

196
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:07,100
I'm not feeling well today

197
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:09,100
I'm doing well

198
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,100
Why?

199
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:12,100
I have a headache

200
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:14,100
Why?

201
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:17,100
I can't go on like this

202
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,100
I have to think of something

203
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:22,100
What do you mean?

204
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:28,100
If I work at this pace, I'll probably die

205
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,100
No

206
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,100
I'm not going to die

207
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,100
I'm doing it

208
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:38,100
I'm doing it

209
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:41,100
It's not my problem

210
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,100
Monday

211
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,100
I'm doing well

212
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:47,100
I'm doing well

213
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,100
Tuesday

214
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:51,100
I'm doing well

215
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,100
Wednesday

216
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:54,100
I'm doing well

217
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,100
Thursday

218
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:59,100
I'm doing well

219
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,100
Friday

220
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,100
I'm doing well

221
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:05,100
Saturday

222
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:07,100
I'm doing well

223
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:09,100
I'm doing well

224
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,100
Sunday

225
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,100
I'm doing well

226
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,100
Nothing

227
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:14,100
I can't go on

228
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:17,100
It's really tough

229
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,100
He is lazy

230
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:22,100
He is lazy on the Sunday

231
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:27,100
If you meet him in your dream on Saturday, you'll take a break on next week

232
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:30,100
So you take a break on Saturday, Sunday and Wednesday

233
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:33,100
Yes

234
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,100
Are you guys stupid?

235
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:39,100
If I ask you honestly, you would think that you have a lot of days off, right?

236
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:44,100
But you know, when you have a day off, you have a day off, and you like this, right?

237
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,100
That's...

238
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:49,100
That's your fault, isn't it?

239
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:51,100
Is it my fault? That I like this?

240
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:53,100
No, it's not.

241
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:56,100
If you spend your time and work hard for that, it can't be helped, right?

242
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:59,100
It can't be helped, isn't it? I have to do that, right?

243
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:03,100
It's hard because I work hard all day long.

244
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:06,100
I just said that I like this, and I don't do anything else.

245
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:10,100
That's because I shop for women, and I like that, so I say that I like this.

246
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:12,100
That's a lie.

247
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:14,100
Shopping is a lie.

248
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,100
Do you think that swapping is a lie?

249
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:19,100
On the other hand, don't you have anything for three days?

250
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:22,100
Well, if you get a special edition or something like that...

251
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:24,100
You always get something, don't you?

252
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:27,100
Well, I got something, so I don't have anything for three days.

253
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:29,100
That's a lie.

254
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,100
That's a lie.

255
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:33,100
You don't travel, do you?

256
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:35,100
You can't stay in Tokyo all the time.

257
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:38,100
We travel from Osaka to Tokyo.

258
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:42,100
The calories and energy you use on a three-hour Shinkansen.

259
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:44,100
I don't use calories.

260
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,100
Even if I use energy.

261
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:48,100
That's a lie.

262
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:51,100
If you think about it like that, you'll get tired.

263
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:56,100
I think it's bad for your body to be on a fast train for three hours.

264
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:59,100
If you go back to the airport, you can go in an hour.

265
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:02,100
That's faster, so I can't go any faster.

266
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,100
But you can go in three hours in a short time.

267
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:06,100
I really think so.

268
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:17,100
I think it's bad for your body to be on a fast train for three hours.

269
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,100
Is that so?

270
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:19,100
That's definitely bad.

271
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:21,100
In the old days, people didn't do that.

272
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:23,100
They used to ride on a basket or something like that.

273
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,100
That's why they took a long breath.

274
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:28,100
It's better not to get on such a fast train.

275
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,100
Is that so?

276
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:36,100
If you think about it like that, you need to rest more.

277
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:38,100
I have a question.

278
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:42,100
How many days do you want to rest?

279
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:46,100
I want to rest five days a week.

280
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:49,100
That's how it is.

281
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:53,100
Three days out of five days.

282
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,100
And two days out of five days.

283
00:12:55,100 --> 00:13:02,100
As you know, if it were me, I would be like this.

284
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:04,100
You can't do that.

285
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:06,100
You can't rest five days a week.

286
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:07,100
Why?

287
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:08,100
Why?

288
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:12,100
Do you want money that much?

289
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:14,100
That's a dirty way of thinking.

290
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:16,100
I don't want money.

291
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:21,100
If you sell 1,000 yen while walking, you'll get it, right?

292
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:24,100
I'll pick it up.

293
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:26,100
What? What?

294
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:29,100
What? What?

295
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,100
Pick it up.

296
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,100
Pick it up?

297
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:33,100
I'll pick it up.

298
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:36,100
I'll pick it up.

299
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:39,100
I'll pick it up. I'll pick it up.

300
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:41,100
Pick it up.

301
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,100
That's strange.

302
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:44,100
No, the intonation is strange.

303
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:46,100
It's still there, right?

304
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:48,100
I've been doing it all the time at home.

305
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:50,100
My wrist hurts.

306
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:52,100
Wrist?

307
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:55,100
If you say that, I won't say anything.

308
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,100
Wrist?

309
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:59,100
No, my wrist hurts.

310
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:01,100
Really?

311
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:03,100
My stomach hurts.

312
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:05,100
My stomach hurts.

313
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:07,100
It's not good.

314
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:09,100
Is it good?

315
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:11,100
My stomach hurts.

316
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:14,100
Let's all use Osaka dialect.

317
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:17,100
Really, Osaka dialect is good.

318
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:20,100
It's like a market.

319
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:23,100
What do you say when you go shopping?

320
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:25,100
You say you're going to the supermarket, right?

321
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:28,100
You say you're going to the market, right?

322
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,100
Isn't that a market?

323
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:32,100
You say it's a market, right?

324
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,100
That's strange. It's a market.

325
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:37,100
I go home and say, hey, did you go to the market today?

326
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:41,100
I went to the supermarket, but I didn't go to the market.

327
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:44,100
I say that.

328
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,100
Why?

329
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:47,100
There's a market in this era, right?

330
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:50,100
There's a big market in the center.

331
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:52,100
That's a market, too.

332
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:55,100
It's a market, including everything.

333
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:57,100
It's a ghost.

334
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:59,100
My mother comes home from work and says,

335
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:01,100
I'm hungry. I'm going to make dinner soon.

336
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:04,100
Mom, I'm going to the market.

337
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:06,100
That's right.

338
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:08,100
That's a market.

339
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,100
That's right.

340
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:11,100
You push it, right?

341
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:13,100
That's right.

342
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:15,100
That's right.

343
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:17,100
That's not true.

344
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:19,100
That's not true.

345
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:21,100
You say it's not true, right?

346
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:23,100
You say it's not true, right?

347
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:25,100
I've been saying this for a long time.

348
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,100
What's unforgivable?

349
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:29,100
That's the most unforgivable thing.

350
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:31,100
That's the best.

351
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:33,100
That's the best.

352
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,100
That's the best.

353
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,100
What's that best?

354
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,100
That's the best.

355
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:41,100
That's the best.

356
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,100
That's the best.

357
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:45,100
Right.

358
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:47,100
You call it best.

359
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:49,100
That's right.

360
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:53,100
You guys can't do it.

361
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:56,100
You guys are cool.

362
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:01,100
Osaka is the center.

363
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:03,100
That's why I think that.

364
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:06,100
The people from Osaka and Tokyo get married a lot.

365
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:09,100
I think it's nice of you.

366
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:13,100
Everything will be mixed and it will be a good feeling.

367
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,100
I don't understand what you're saying.

368
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,100
Mixed and it will be a good feeling.

369
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:23,100
The Osaka dialect and the standard Japanese will be mixed and it will be a new word that will disappear.

370
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:25,100
I see.

371
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:30,100
I'm so tired today.

372
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:34,100
What are you talking about?

373
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:39,100
There will be no manga.

374
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:42,100
There will be no IKIMANGA today.

375
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:45,100
And the next step will be a new word.

376
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:47,100
What do you mean by the next step?

377
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:53,100
The Japanese will communicate with foreigners.

378
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:57,100
This is a pen dengana.

379
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:59,100
I'm so tired.

380
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:01,100
Let's go to the postcards.

381
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:06,100
There aren't many pictures of this kind of postcards.

382
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:09,100
Oh, it came out on its own.

383
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:12,100
Hello.

384
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:15,100
Please come to the middle.

385
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:17,100
Are you a model today as well?

386
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:18,100
What's your name?

387
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:20,100
I'm Yoshimura Michiko.

388
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:21,100
How old are you?

389
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:23,100
I'm 20 years old.

390
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:25,100
What about your hair?

391
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:28,100
I'm eating it.

392
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:32,100
You're eating your hair all the time.

393
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:34,100
Thank you very much.

394
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:38,100
Thank you very much.

395
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,100
Let me introduce you to the next person.

396
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:44,100
This person's pen name is Lulai Lulai.

397
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:46,100
Thank you very much.

398
00:17:46,100 --> 00:18:06,100
Do you have any friends who would die for you?

399
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:10,100
He's so rude.

400
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:11,100
What's rude?

401
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:16,100
He thinks love is very important.

402
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:25,100
That's why he can protect his girlfriend and his partner.

403
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:28,100
It depends on the situation.

404
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,100
What?

405
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:31,100
If you're involved.

406
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:33,100
What kind of guy is involved?

407
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:35,100
Is there anyone who gets involved with me?

408
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:38,100
I'm the one who fights.

409
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:41,100
What kind of person are you?

410
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:43,100
What kind of person are you?

411
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:47,100
For example, if you have a knife.

412
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:52,100
I've never thought I was afraid of knives.

413
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:56,100
If you have a girlfriend.

414
00:18:56,100 --> 00:19:06,100
What?

415
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:09,100
He's talking about a knife.

416
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:10,100
Is that a knife?

417
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:11,100
It's a knife.

418
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:13,100
What are you going to do if you get stabbed?

419
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:15,100
What kind of knife is that?

420
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:19,100
What kind of knife is that?

421
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:23,100
If it's this back, it's already stabbed at this point.

422
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:28,100
If you ask me that, I can't tell you the truth.

423
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,100
It's about this.

424
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:31,100
It's about this.

425
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:34,100
I'll leave it at this for today.

426
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:37,100
I'll leave it at this for today.

427
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:38,100
But wait a minute.

428
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:43,100
You're talking without saying anything.

429
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:45,100
That's the funny guy.

430
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:48,100
It doesn't matter who it is.

431
00:19:48,100 --> 00:20:03,100
This guy is really funny.

432
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:07,100
I'll wrap it up with love.

433
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:10,100
It's stuck to the root.

434
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:11,100
What are you going to do?

435
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:13,100
Wrap it up.

436
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:15,100
I can't wrap it up.

437
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:16,100
Why?

438
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:19,100
I can't wrap it up.

439
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:25,100
But I want to wrap up a poor kid like that.

440
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:28,100
What if it goes to the woman?

441
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:29,100
What?

442
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:31,100
What if it goes to the woman?

443
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:33,100
That's the pattern.

444
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:42,100
You have to protect the woman.

445
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:48,100
What are you doing?

446
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:50,100
That's a big mistake.

447
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:52,100
What is this?

448
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:55,100
It's a festival.

449
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:56,100
It's a lie.

450
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,100
Leave it to me.

451
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:59,100
I'm really good at telling the truth.

452
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:09,100
You're starting to look like Yasukio.

453
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:11,100
What do you want?

454
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:13,100
Are you going to fall down?

455
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:15,100
I can't do that.

456
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,100
What?

457
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:23,100
I can't do that.

458
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:24,100
I can do it.

459
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:26,100
Leave the knife.

460
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:28,100
What about the pistol?

461
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:33,100
The pistol is the easiest.

462
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:34,100
Die!

463
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:38,100
Bang!

464
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:39,100
Bang!

465
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:46,100
Bang!

466
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:51,100
What are you doing?

467
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:53,100
That's all for today.

468
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:55,100
That's all for today?

469
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:56,100
The show.

470
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:59,100
Oh, the show.

471
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:01,100
That's all for today.

472
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:03,100
I'll see you in the spring.

473
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:06,100
You'll see me in the spring?

474
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:10,100
You'll see me in the spring?

475
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:12,100
Spring is coming.

476
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:15,100
Let's have another event for the show.

477
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:17,100
What?

478
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:20,100
Why not?

479
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:21,100
It's hard.

480
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:23,100
Let's do it.

481
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:30,100
You're always good.

482
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,100
That's enough.

483
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:33,100
What?

484
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:36,100
We're doing the punishment game together.

485
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:39,100
With the fans.

486
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:42,100
You're going to ask the young girls to play?

487
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:45,100
They're going to dig up the soil.

488
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:48,100
That's nice.

489
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:51,100
I'm going to do it.

490
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:55,100
And there's a talent like Mr. Ishii.

491
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:56,100
He wants to be on the show.

492
00:22:56,100 --> 00:23:00,100
He wants to be on the show.

493
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:03,100
For example, someone like who?

494
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:07,100
If it's a big star, it's...

495
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:13,100
Mori Ogami.

496
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:15,100
Really?

497
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:17,100
Really?

498
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:18,100
You're lying.

499
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:20,100
I knew it.

500
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:23,100
Anyway, everyone, please come to the show.

501
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:25,100
I can't use the show, so I'll see you next time.

502
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:32,100
Goodbye.
