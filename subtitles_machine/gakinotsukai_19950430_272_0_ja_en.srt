1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
How many meals can you eat with this side dish?

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
This time it's the same as the title

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
The winner will receive a prize

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Last time, Suzuki-kun won 100,000 yen

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Let's do our best this time

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I won't say anything interesting

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
When did he change his mind?

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
This program is brought to you by these sponsors

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Here are the side dishes

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
You can choose whatever you like

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Then you can eat

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
We don't know which one you will choose

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Let's start with Suzuki-kun

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Lucky Seven

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
This is interesting

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I will choose No.3

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I will choose No.6

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
No.6? I see

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Let's see one by one

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Gao from the soccer club

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Next

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
This is good

23
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
What is this?

24
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
This is good

25
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Let's see Suga-chan's

26
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
No way

27
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
This is really good

28
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
It's the same

29
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Let's see Sago-chan

30
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
This is not good

31
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
It's not good

32
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
If you eat too much, you will get hungry

33
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Everyone, sit down

34
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Start

35
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
You have to eat it until you give up

36
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Wait

37
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
That man

38
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Eat it with mayonnaise

39
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Gao, second

40
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Eat it now, eat more

41
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Sago-chan

42
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Finally takoyaki

43
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Takodake

44
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
You are learning

45
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Right, Hamada?

46
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
When I was eating, a man dressed up as Tozan came

47
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
He ordered 3 curries

48
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
He ate while crying

49
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
What was that?

50
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
He ordered 3 curries

51
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
He ate while crying

52
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
What was that?

53
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I don't know

54
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
It was Tozan's

55
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Let's see

56
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Leave it

57
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
It's enough

58
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Saga-chan, what will you do?

59
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I will stop

60
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Saga-chan got 3

61
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
It's big

62
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
It's big

63
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
15

64
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Please open it

65
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
It's the worst

66
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Wait

67
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
It's really bad

68
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
It's really bad

69
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
What will you do, Saga-chan?

70
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I don't want to eat it

71
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I don't want to eat it

72
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Saga-chan got 3

73
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Open

74
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
This is

75
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
It's not open

76
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
It's not open

77
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
It's not open

78
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
It's not open

79
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Shake it

80
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
That's how you do it

81
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Get out

82
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Suzuki got 4

83
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Open

84
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
This is the worst

85
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Jam bun and cream bun

86
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
This is the worst

87
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I want this

88
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
It looks delicious

89
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Saga-san's soup is gone

90
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
It's gone

91
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
It's all gone

92
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
He used it too much

93
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Wait

94
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
What is this?

95
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Your youth has just started

96
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Why are you like that?

97
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
No

98
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Gochisosama deshita

99
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I'm going to hit you

100
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Evo-kun

101
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
It's light

102
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
It's really heavy

103
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
This is good

104
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
The meat is not good

105
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
The meat is not good

106
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
The meat is not good

107
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:31,000
He said I can't eat meat

108
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Evo 0

109
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
What should I do?

110
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
What number?

111
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Number 8

112
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
It's heavy

113
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
It's heavy

114
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Open

115
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Please stop

116
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Please

117
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Anko

118
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Anko

119
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Koshi-an

120
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
It's koshi-an

121
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
It's sweet

122
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
At least give me 2-an

123
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I don't want it

124
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I don't want it

125
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I said I can eat 8

126
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:21,000
What kind of harmony is this?

127
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
It's like rice

128
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
It's like Iwanori

129
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Iwanori is good

130
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Iwanori is good

131
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
This is the spirit of an entertainer

132
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Otomo, open

133
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Evo-san

134
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
It's heavy

135
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Let's go with raw liver

136
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
This is good

137
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Number 12

138
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
What is it?

139
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
What is it?

140
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Hama-chan, please open

141
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Please

142
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
It's the worst

143
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I don't want it

144
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I don't want it

145
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I don't want it

146
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
It's light

147
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
It's light

148
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
It's a good face

149
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Eat

150
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
It's pineapple

151
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
It's not pineapple

152
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
It's not pineapple

153
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
It's interesting

154
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
It's good

155
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
The rice is good

156
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
It's good

157
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
It's good

158
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
It doesn't make a sound

159
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
It's special

160
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
It's talent

161
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
It doesn't make a sound

162
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I chose it

163
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Number 1

164
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
It's heavy

165
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
It's a big service

166
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
It's so sweet

167
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
It's good

168
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
How many times did you eat?

169
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
4 times

170
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
He is doing something

171
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
He is doing something

172
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
He is doing something

173
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I don't need a phone

174
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
You can put a pineapple

175
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
You can put a pineapple

176
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
You can put a pineapple

177
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
You can put a pineapple

178
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
It looks good

179
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
It looks good

180
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Is it for a party?

181
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Yes

182
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
No

183
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
You can put it on the table

184
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
You can put it on the table

185
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Where are you going?

186
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
You can eat it quickly

187
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
You can eat it quickly

188
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I will put it on the table

189
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I will put it on the table

190
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
It's a tie

191
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
It's a tie

192
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
It's a tie

193
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Why?

194
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Why?

195
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Why?

196
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
It may not be on the air

197
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
It may not be on the air

198
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
It may not be on the air

199
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
It's a lot

200
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
It's a lot

201
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I prepared something good

202
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I prepared something good

203
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
My stomach hurts

204
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Start

205
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
It's not good

206
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
It's not good

207
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
It's not good

208
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
It's good

209
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
It's good

210
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
What is that?

211
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
It's a cat toy

212
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
It's a cat toy

213
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
It's starting

214
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Please forgive me

215
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
It's called a combo

216
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
It's called a combo

217
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
It's good

218
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
It's good

219
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
It's a good combo

220
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
It's a good combo

221
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
It's a good combo

222
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
It's a good combo

223
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
It's a good combo

224
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
You had a good break

225
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I have nothing to do

226
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I have nothing to do

227
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I was wondering what to do

228
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I went to the car shop

229
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I went there

230
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
You went to play sometimes

231
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I didn't have fun at all

232
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I didn't have fun at all

233
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I went to a haunted house

234
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I didn't have fun at all

235
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I spent 500 yen

236
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
No, it's not that

237
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
No, no, no

238
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
There is only this stage

239
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
No, no

240
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
No, no

241
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
It's like this

242
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
What's next?

243
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I don't know

244
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
That was the scariest

245
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
In a different way

246
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
What is that?

247
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
You don't ride a normal roller coaster

248
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
You don't ride a normal roller coaster

249
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
So

250
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Yes, yes

251
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
This

252
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
What?

253
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
What?

254
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
You didn't go to a party?

255
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I thought I had to ride

256
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I thought I had to ride

257
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
No, no

258
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Let me say

259
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Let me say

260
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Let me say

261
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Why couldn't I ride a roller coaster?

262
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Why couldn't I ride a roller coaster?

263
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
There was a reason

264
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
In the past, roller coasters

265
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
You were told that you only ride roller coasters

266
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
You were told that you only ride roller coasters

267
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
You are a fool

268
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Yes

269
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Why? What was the reason?

270
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
A roller coaster

271
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
A roller coaster

272
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I was a roller coaster

273
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
It's fine

274
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Why?

275
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
What is fine?

276
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
From now on, I will become a warrior

277
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I don't care

278
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I don't care

279
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Tell me the reason

280
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
There is a reason

281
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
It's you

282
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
It's you

283
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
It's you

284
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
It's you

285
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
It's you

286
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I can't say it

287
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I can't say it

288
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I can't say it

289
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I can't say it

290
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Have you ever been to a roller coaster?

291
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
There is a roller coaster called Jet Star 2

292
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
There is

293
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
The two of us

294
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
The two of us

295
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
In front and behind

296
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Like this

297
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I'm not scared

298
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I'm not scared

299
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I'm not scared

300
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Push

301
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Push

302
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
On my back

303
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
On my back

304
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I'm not scared

305
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I'm not scared

306
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I'm not scared

307
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Let's go

308
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Let's go

309
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Who wants to go to an amusement park with you?

310
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I don't want to go to an amusement park

311
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Let's go

312
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Let's go

313
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
You are disgusting

314
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
You are disgusting

315
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Don't spit it out

316
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
What?

317
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Let's go

318
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I don't want to

319
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Don't spit it out

320
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Don't eat sushi

321
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I don't want to

322
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
No

323
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Don't eat sushi

324
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I don't want to

325
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I don't want to go to an amusement park

326
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I want to go

327
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I don't want to go with you

328
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I don't want to

329
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
It's not like that

330
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Where do you want to go?

331
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
There's a place where you can bungee jump

332
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
What's the point of going there?

333
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Wait a minute

334
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Wait a minute

335
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Even though we were together

336
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
You were beaten

337
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Why do you exist?

338
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I don't care

339
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Anna is scary too

340
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Aren't you scared?

341
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
What are you scared of?

342
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
What are you saying?

343
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
You and I are different

344
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
What are you scared of?

345
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
What are you scared of bungee jumping?

346
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
What are you scared of bungee jumping?

347
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
If you keep going

348
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Keep going

349
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
What are you scared of?

350
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
What are you scared of?

351
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
First of all, it's high

352
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
When you fall, you don't know if you're going to cut yourself

353
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I see

354
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
For me

355
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
The bottom

356
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
What do you call it?

357
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
There's something like a mat

358
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
At the amusement park

359
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
That big one

360
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I'm scared of that

361
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I can't stand that feeling

362
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
That's why

363
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I can't do it

364
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
If you take it off

365
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
If you move it

366
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Well

367
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Why?

368
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I need to take a break

369
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Talent

370
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
It's better not to show it in private

371
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
If you show it

372
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
It's better to have a mystery

373
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Yes

374
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
You like to talk

375
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I'm full of mysteries

376
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I only do this when I'm on TV

377
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I only do this when I'm on TV

378
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Basically

379
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I'm a kimono

380
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I ride a car

381
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
But

382
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I can't do it

383
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Like this

384
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
When are you wearing a kimono?

385
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
What is this?

386
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
When are you wearing a kimono?

387
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
When are you wearing a kimono?

388
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Why are you kissing me?

389
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
That's why

390
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
On my day off

391
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I'm wearing a kimono

392
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
That's a lie

393
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Why don't you know

394
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
If I'm wearing a kimono or not?

395
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I'm not wearing it

396
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
That's gross

397
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Right?

398
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
What do you want to do?

399
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I don't know

400
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Aren't humans annoying?

401
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
I don't have pockets

402
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I don't have pockets

403
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Even if you cut your nails

404
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
You know you have to cut it again

405
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
You know you have to cut it again

406
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
It grows

407
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
That's annoying

408
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I don't want to cut it

409
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I don't want to cut it

410
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I don't want to cut my fingers

411
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I don't want to cut my feet

412
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
If I cut my feet

413
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
If I cut my little finger

414
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
My posture won't be like this

415
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
When I cut it

416
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I don't want to cut my fingers

417
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I want to cut my toes

418
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I don't want to cut my toes

419
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Why?

420
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
You're talking about my fingers

421
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I'm talking about my toes

422
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
That's poop

423
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Do you want to do it one last time?

424
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Do it for an hour

425
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I don't want to

426
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I don't want to

427
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I don't want to

428
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I don't want to

429
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I don't want to

430
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I don't want to

431
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I don't want to

432
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
But sometimes you have to put up with it

433
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
You have to put up with it

434
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
You have to put up with it

435
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
It's not good

436
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I don't want to

437
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I don't want to

438
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I've failed so many times

439
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
You're a grown up

440
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Don't you know?

441
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I've failed

442
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
The elevator

443
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I was totally fine until then, but when I got out of the elevator, I suddenly went like this.

444
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I went like this.

445
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
And then I went like this.

446
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
I couldn't take it anymore.

447
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
I was like a superman.

448
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
While I was running.

449
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,000
And then I went like this.

450
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
I could fly.

451
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
And then I went like this.

452
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:56,000
And then I went like this.

453
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
You were disqualified.

454
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I couldn't take it anymore.

455
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
I went like this.

456
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
And then I went like this.

457
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
And then I went like this.

458
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I said, Hau.

459
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:25,000
What kind of reaction do you take when you see your parents' sexiness?

460
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
What kind of reaction did you take?

461
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:32,000
To be honest, this is the end of the world.

462
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:48,000
If you are a kid watching TV, you should never show your sexiness.

463
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:53,000
It depends on how you look at it.

464
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Every time you look at it, your attitude changes?

465
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
That's right.

466
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:03,000
You shouldn't look at it like that.

467
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,000
You shouldn't look at it like that.

468
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Go! Go!

469
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Go! Go!

470
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Your father doesn't like it either.

471
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Say something!

472
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Say something!

473
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,000
That's enough!

474
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I think I've said this many times, but when I forgot to blow my whistle and went home to get it...

475
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
You didn't do it.

476
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
That's right. I was scared.

477
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I can't believe I forgot to blow my whistle.

478
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
You were blowing your own whistle.

479
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:51,000
I was blowing my own whistle.

480
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Wait a minute! I'm going to sue you!

481
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I'm going to sue you!

482
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Why?

483
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Why?

484
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Pay for your sex!

485
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
I didn't do anything to you.

486
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Family harassment!

487
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Family harassment!

488
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
You said you were going to sue me.

489
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Please praise each other in English.

490
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Cute or beautiful.

491
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
By the way, this is the same.

492
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Please praise each other.

493
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Sweet!

494
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Delicious!

495
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Wait a minute.

496
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
What?

497
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Delicious?

498
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
That was close.

499
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
That was close. That's good.

500
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Juicy!

501
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Juicy?

502
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Pumpkin!

503
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,000
You...

504
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
What do you mean?

505
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
What do you mean?

506
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
That sounds good.

507
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Is that okay?

508
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:24,000
I don't know anything about that.

509
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Miso soup!

510
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
That's not good.

511
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,000
What? Miso soup?

512
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
That's not good.

513
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Soy sauce!

514
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
That's not good.

515
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Soy sauce?

516
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
That's not good.

517
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
You mean soy sauce?

518
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Damn, it's delicious!

519
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
What are you talking about?

520
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
That's not good.

521
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
It's okay.

522
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
My value.

523
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
500 pounds.

524
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
You said pounds?

525
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
I said pounds.

526
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
500 points.

527
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:14,000
This program was brought to you by these sponsors.
