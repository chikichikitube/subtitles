00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Please enjoy the commercial of Gio's.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Next time, at Gaki no Tsukai, Chiki Chiki Gaki no Tsukai OPEN!

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Today, we'll be using a special club.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
A special club?

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
That's right.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
And we'll be playing golf.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
This is probably a serious story.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I think someone will get hurt.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
There's no doubt about that.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
But first, let's take a look at what we have here.

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
This is our special club.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
This is our captain.

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Our director.

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Your sleeves are so long.

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Look at your feet.

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
They're too short.

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Don't say that.

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Oh, you're saying it.

19
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
You're so loud.

20
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
You don't sound like a human.

21
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
You're so high up.

22
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
The dolphins are gathering.

23
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
You're the first one.

24
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Is that okay?

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Tamao is the first one.

26
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
You can't do that.

27
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
You can't do that.

28
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Okay, let's go.

29
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
One, two, three.

30
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
It's OB.

31
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'm sorry.

32
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
It's OB.

33
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
It's OB.

34
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Tamao.

35
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Tamao is jumping too high.

36
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Let's go with this.

37
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Let's go with this.

38
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
One, two, three.

39
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Okay.

40
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
It's okay.

41
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
It's okay.

42
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Let's go with this.

43
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Let's go with this.

44
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
This is good.

45
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Wait a minute.

46
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Let's go.

47
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Do it slowly.

48
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
That's...

49
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
You're talking too much.

50
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Wait a minute.

51
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Wait a minute.

52
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
What?

53
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Wait a minute.

54
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
It's dangerous.

55
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
One, two, three.

56
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

57
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Don't jump.

58
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
It was a slight slide.

59
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Hey, hey, hey.

60
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
One, two, three.

61
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
It was a slight slide.

62
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
It was a slight slide.

63
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
We can do the same thing.

64
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
One, two, three.

65
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

66
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
No, no, no.

67
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
No, no, no.

68
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I'm going to get a phone call.

69
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Don't tease Chibikko.

70
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Tamao.

71
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
With the sand.

72
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Yes.

73
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
With the sand.

74
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
With the sand.

75
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
That's the most interesting one.

76
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
One, two, three.

77
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Don't jump.

78
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
It's close to the end.

79
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Let's go with the putter.

80
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Let's go with the putter.

81
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
It can't be helped.

82
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Let's go with the putter.

83
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
One, two, three.

84
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

85
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

86
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
My body twisted.

87
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Why can't you jump?

88
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Because I'm a putter.

89
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
It was a slight slide.

90
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Let's change the ball.

91
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
It was a slight slide.

92
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I was able to do this with Nikki Golf.

93
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
It's a good ball.

94
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Oh, sorry.

95
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I can't get in.

96
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Oh, sorry.

97
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
The game is over.

98
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Yes.

99
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
We can't go home with this club.

100
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
They were not as good as I thought.

101
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Let's return this club quickly.

102
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Let's return this club quickly.

103
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Yes.

104
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I've prepared an expensive bottle.

105
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Yes.

106
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
OK.

107
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I'm sorry.

108
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Get in.

109
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Get in.

110
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I'm sorry.

111
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Hello.

112
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Good morning.

113
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Good morning.

114
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Good morning.

115
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Why are you wiping your hands?

116
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Well.

117
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Well.

118
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Well.

119
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Well.

120
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Well.

121
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Let's have a beer.

122
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I'm sorry.

123
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Ladies and gentlemen.

124
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
The fuel limit of this program is increasing.

125
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Is that so?

126
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Yes.

127
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Well.

128
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Well.

129
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
This year.

130
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
It used to be 18 years old or older.

131
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
It used to be 18 years old or older.

132
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
It's not even 18 years old now.

133
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Is that so?

134
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Yes.

135
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
It's more than 18 years old.

136
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
What?

137
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
It's 21 years old.

138
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
It's going up more and more.

139
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
That's why I've been working overtime lately.

140
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
It's like I'm putting up an oasis.

141
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
That's a big deal.

142
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
That's a big deal.

143
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
It's getting tough.

144
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I can't control it.

145
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
It depends on the fuel limit.

146
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
That's right.

147
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
It depends on the fuel limit.

148
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
That's right.

149
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Don't eat too much.

150
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Don't eat too much.

151
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
The age limit is increasing.

152
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
It feels like I'm an adult.

153
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
What's going on?

154
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
That's proof.

155
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
After the program is over.

156
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
It's like a chase.

157
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
It's like a chase.

158
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I'm all alone.

159
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I'm lonely when I'm on the stage.

160
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I don't think anyone is there when I'm on the stage.

161
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
It's like a guard in a book.

162
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Yes, yes, yes.

163
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I don't like it.

164
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
It's like I want to go home.

165
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
It's all right.

166
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
It's all right.

167
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
But as you said, I have to decide on the top.

168
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
How many?

169
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
It's a program, so I want a young laughter.

170
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
It's like a needle.

171
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I'm in my 20s.

172
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I see.

173
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
It starts at 21.

174
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
21 is right.

175
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
What about me?

176
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Older people are worse than me.

177
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
That's proof.

178
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
That's proof.

179
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
If we go up, the program will go up.

180
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
That's proof.

181
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
It's 29.

182
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
It's 29.

183
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
What's the current limit?

184
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
The current limit is 29.

185
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
What about my mother?

186
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Your mother is already out.

187
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
It's over 50.

188
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I didn't say that much.

189
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
It's about 60.

190
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I didn't say that much.

191
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
You're lucky.

192
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
You're lucky.

193
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:18,000
You're lucky.

194
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Well, that's it.

195
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Did you hear that?

196
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Yes.

197
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Really.

198
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Who said really?

199
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
What happened recently?

200
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Something has changed.

201
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
What?

202
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Michael Jackson is still something.

203
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
What do you mean?

204
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Will it come in December?

205
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I don't know.

206
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Will it come in December?

207
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Michael Jackson is still sick.

208
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Except for his strange face?

209
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
He has a lot of things.

210
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
He's strange.

211
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
When I came to Japan,

212
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
He said he didn't like cigarettes.

213
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
He rented all the rooms in the hotel.

214
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
He put up wallpapers in the hallway.

215
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
He said he smelled cigarettes.

216
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
In the room.

217
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
He's an idiot.

218
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
He's an idiot.

219
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
He said he didn't like cigarettes before he sold them.

220
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
What did he do before he sold them?

221
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Before he sold them?

222
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
He was a bad guy before he sold them.

223
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
He didn't like flowers.

224
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
He didn't say that.

225
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
He can't stand it.

226
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
He's a bad guy.

227
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
He can't stand it.

228
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
He can't stand it.

229
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
When he sold them,

230
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
He changed his face a lot.

231
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
When he came to Japan,

232
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
He took a monkey with him.

233
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
He said,

234
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
That monkey smells bad.

235
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
If it smells bad,

236
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Put it in your nose.

237
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:51,000
In your plastic nose.

238
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
He's a bad guy.

239
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
He said,

240
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
He likes amusement parks.

241
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
That's right.

242
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
He's an idiot.

243
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
He's an idiot.

244
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
He didn't say that.

245
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
He didn't say that.

246
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
He didn't say that.

247
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
He didn't say that.

248
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
There's a roller coaster.

249
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
It's amazing.

250
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
What?

251
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
What?

252
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
It's inside the building.

253
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
No matter what it is,

254
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
It's a roller coaster.

255
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
It's inside the building.

256
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
It's inside the building.

257
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
That's right.

258
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
No matter what it is,

259
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
It's outside.

260
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I've heard of it.

261
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Who?

262
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Everyone says it.

263
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Who says everyone?

264
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
The people who live around here.

265
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Have you ever talked to them?

266
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
It's so weird.

267
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:52,000
It's an amazing house.

268
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I don't know.

269
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I don't know if it's him.

270
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
They are not making money.

271
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
That's why they love it so much.

272
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
That's why they went crazy to that place.

273
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
That monkey isn't him.

274
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Why?

275
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Why are you talking so small?

276
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
He's singing, and when he turns, his nose goes like this!

277
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Don't look for me by my pen name.

278
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I'll read it.

279
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Do you think women are more beautiful than men?

280
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I don't think so.

281
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
What does that mean?

282
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:33,000
For example, we're in Osaka, but women are more beautiful than men.

283
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Women are beautiful.

284
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
And, well, a good woman comes here, a good man comes here,

285
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
they're tied up here, they're born here, they're raised here, they grow up here.

286
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
In that sense, the overall level is high here.

287
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I see.

288
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
But there are far more ugly women.

289
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
You know, the beautiful wife who was killed by something.

290
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I've never seen a beautiful wife.

291
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
That's right.

292
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
You're not beautiful at all.

293
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,000
That's why I told you before, the beautiful wife.

294
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
That's right.

295
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
You're not a beautiful wife.

296
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
If you say something like that, it's hard to get a job.

297
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
That's right.

298
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I was born in 1929.

299
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Who are you?

300
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I've never seen a beautiful woman.

301
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I see.

302
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,000
You're all ugly.

303
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
What?

304
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
You're all ugly.

305
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
You're all ugly.

306
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Ha!

307
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Do you hear that?

308
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
The tires.

309
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Ha!

310
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Do you hear that?

311
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
If you hear that, you'll be angry.

312
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
You're all ugly.

313
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I cried a lot.

314
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I thought you were a parking violation.

315
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I apologized normally.

316
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I'm not Yuta anymore.

317
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I'm sorry.

318
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
By the way, you have an ugly face.

319
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Who is responsible for this?

320
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
It's an ugly face.

321
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
It's all over the place.

322
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
That's right.

323
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
That's right.

324
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
That's why I can't say it's all right.

325
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
That's right.

326
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
It's definitely an ugly face.

327
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:31,000
For example, today, I was most afraid of being hit by a box.

328
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
You're nervous.

329
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I'm nervous.

330
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I'm nervous.

331
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I looked at it.

332
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Oh, you're a pretty good woman.

333
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
What do you think?

334
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Wow!

335
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Wow!

336
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I can't help but look at you.

337
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
This is.

338
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
It's amazing, isn't it?

339
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,000
The more I look back, the more amazing it is.

340
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I don't even know what kind of person I am when I look back.

341
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
This is the reason why I hate it.

342
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I don't know.

343
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I see.

344
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Don't look at me.

345
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
That's right.

346
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Men are at a higher level, aren't they?

347
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Women say a lot about men.

348
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,000
From my point of view, there are a lot of cool men now.

349
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
But there aren't many cute women.

350
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Why do you say that?

351
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Oh, it's completely different.

352
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Hasn't there been a lot of cool men walking around with ugly women lately?

353
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
There are quite a few, aren't there?

354
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Are there still a lot of cool and beautiful women in couples?

355
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Right now, there are a lot of cool men with ugly women.

356
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Oh, really?

357
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Yes.

358
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Why?

359
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Because the level of men is generally high.

360
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Because the level of women is low.

361
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
It's true.

362
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I've seen a lot of different patterns.

363
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
What kind of women?

364
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I've seen a lot of people with ugly men.

365
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:16,000
There weren't many nice couples.

366
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Oh, I see.

367
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Hiromi Okawa and Tohdo.

368
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I don't think they're a nice couple.

369
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
They're a nice couple.

370
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
They're not a nice couple.

371
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
What are you thinking?

372
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
What?

373
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Mr. Tohdo has a beautiful wife.

374
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
What are you talking about?

375
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
They're not a nice couple.

376
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I haven't seen a lot of nice couples lately, but men are definitely...

377
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Everyone says, but they're definitely on a higher level.

378
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Women are getting out of hand.

379
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I don't think I'm bad at all.

380
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I'd like you to think about it.

381
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Now, my sister is working hard to aim for the entertainment industry.

382
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I used to hear a lot about how if you didn't have sex with the president, you wouldn't be able to sell it.

383
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Tell me the truth.

384
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
What do you think?

385
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Even for idols, if you don't sleep with the president, you won't be able to get a push.

386
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I've never heard of it.

387
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,000
It used to happen a lot in the past.

388
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
It was selling well.

389
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Think about it.

390
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
It was selling well, but suddenly...

391
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
There are people who suddenly fall in love.

392
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
That's enough.

393
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
That's all the president's women.

394
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
The president asked me to draw a picture.

395
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I've been chasing Mr. Matsuzaka ever since.

396
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Oh, I see.

397
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
There are women like that.

398
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
There are.

399
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
What?

400
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
For example, Tetsuo Ishidate.

401
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Why?

402
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Well...

403
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
He's in good spirits.

404
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Why is Mimikuso sweet?

405
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
It's Hanakuso.

406
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Why is Hanakuso sweet, but Mimikuso spicy?

407
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I think this is really good.

408
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:34,000
You mean Hanakuso is sweet, but Mimikuso is spicy?

409
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Wait a minute.

410
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Hanakuso has been eaten once by anyone.

411
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
How? What do you mean?

412
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Hanakuso is crushed, and it's pretty good.

413
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Don't you eat it with your clothes on?

414
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Don't you eat it even when you're a kid?

415
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
No, no, no.

416
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
You don't eat it?

417
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
No, no, no.

418
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Everyone eats Hanakuso.

419
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I can't eat it.

420
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
You guys are full of lies.

421
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Hey, that's not true.

422
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Look, Hanakuso.

423
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I ate a lot.

424
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
You ate it, didn't you?

425
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I'm sick of them.

426
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Why did you eat it?

427
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I'd like to ask you something here.

428
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,000
When Hanakuso was eaten and there was nothing to throw away,

429
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,000
When there was nothing, I was able to get a lot of Hanakuso.

430
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,000
It's dirtier to put this under a chair, isn't it?

431
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:44,000
If you're going to put it on, eat it.

432
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Why are you talking like this?

433
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
That's right.

434
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
It's dirty.

435
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
It's better to put it on a chair or something.

436
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Why do you eat such a thing?

437
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Are you okay with putting a Hanako on it?

438
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I'm fine with it.

439
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
No, no, no, no.

440
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
No, no, no, no.

441
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I don't like it at all.

442
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
There's nothing in there I've ever put on.

443
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I can't get rid of it.

444
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Even in the summer, when you wear shoes,

445
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:22,000
You smell like you want it, don't you?

446
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
What the hell is this guy?

447
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I've seen him a lot.

448
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
That's true, isn't it?

449
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Well, that might be true.

450
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
That's true, isn't it?

451
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Well, that might be true.

452
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
No, that's not true.

453
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:40,000
If you take off your underwear and poop, you smell, don't you?

454
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
What are you talking about?

455
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I don't smell at all.

456
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
You don't smell at all?

457
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I thought you did.

458
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I'm sure there's poop in your underwear.

459
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
100% there is.

460
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
You can tell when there is.

461
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:03,000
After you went to poop, you didn't wipe it off, did you?

462
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
That's why you smell.

463
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
You can tell when there is.

464
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
You can tell when there is.

465
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I went home.

466
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
You went home.

467
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Well, just a little bit of fun.

468
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Well, just a little bit of fun.

469
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I'm sure there's poop in your underwear.

470
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
100% there is.

471
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
You can tell when there is.

472
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I'm sure there is.

473
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
But I don't think there's much poop in your underwear.

474
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I wonder.

475
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I don't think there's much poop in your underwear.

476
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,000
How many times do you wipe your underwear?

477
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I usually wipe it once or twice.

478
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
What?

479
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
You only wipe it twice?

480
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Twice.

481
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
You only wipe it once, don't you?

482
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Then the poop must be everywhere.

483
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,000
The first time is a little weird.

484
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
That's the second time.

485
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
It's pretty obvious.

486
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
It's pretty obvious.

487
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
It's pretty obvious.

488
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Then you'll wipe it the next time you go.

489
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
You know you're going to wipe it.

490
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Don't even do it if you know you're going to do it.

491
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I don't care anymore.

492
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
What are you talking about?

493
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,000
I don't care anymore.

494
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Idiot.

495
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Just one more blow. That's it.

496
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
It's not good to blow too much.

497
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
That's why you should blow as much as you can.

498
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
I can't blow as much as I can.

499
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Why?

500
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:39,000
I don't know.

501
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I can't blow as much as I can.

502
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Idiot.

503
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
My science skills are getting better and better.

504
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Just a while ago, Mr. Mori's shuttle was blown up again.

505
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
I'm living in such a great era.

506
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
I don't know why the phone still works.

507
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
I don't know why I can talk to someone who is thousands of kilometers away.

508
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I can't even imagine PAX.

509
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Am I living in such an era?

510
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I see.

511
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
It's true.

512
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
There's no one who can explain it.

513
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
It was amazing.

514
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
I saw something on TV the other day.

515
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,000
There were thousands of phones in one phone line.

516
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
They were connected like this.

517
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
They were doing something like that.

518
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
They were doing something like that.

519
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Isn't that all?

520
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
No, no, no, no.

521
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:40,000
I don't know how to say hello.

522
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I don't know.

523
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
That's no good.

524
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Do you know?

525
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:51,000
I know.

526
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
It's a dream.

527
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Can I go?

528
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Can I go?

529
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Can I go?

530
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Are you an amateur?

531
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Are you awake?

532
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Are you waiting for me?

533
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
It's a dream.

534
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
There was a person called Bell in the past.

535
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
That's no good.

536
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
It doesn't matter if you're a master.

537
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
It doesn't matter if you're a master.

538
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
I'm talking from here.

539
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I see.

540
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I don't understand.

541
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:20,000
There was a person called Bell in the past.

542
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:37,000
That's no good.
