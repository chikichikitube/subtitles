1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Now, Dantan's kid's hand.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Uwaaaaa!

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I'm not scared at all.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I'm not scared at all.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I don't understand anything.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I understand.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I see.

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Yesterday, the boss was like this.

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
He was like this.

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
In this way, he was like this.

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
He was like this.

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
He was like this.

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
He was like this.

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
He was like this.

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm right here.

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Today,

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I just finished shooting.

18
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm removing my make-up.

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Well, I always do it easily.

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm going to remove it.

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
This is the first time.

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm going to use the kid.

23
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm going to take a bath.

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm going to take a bath.

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm going to take a bath.

26
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm going to take a bath.

27
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Now, let's get back to the game.

28
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I got injured quite a lot, didn't I?

29
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I was wondering if my face would be the same as before.

30
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I guess the medicine worked.

31
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I look so much better now.

32
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
The other day, my staff went to your house to pick you up.

33
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
He said, this is terrible, but I won't make it to the next shoot.

34
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
That face is terrible.

35
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
So he set it up like this.

36
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I was supposed to be doing the same thing as last week.

37
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
But it looks like you've already recovered.

38
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I'm sorry.

39
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Did you know that your staff came to our house to spy on you?

40
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm not a spy.

41
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I came here because I was worried about you.

42
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
That's not a secret.

43
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I came here to find out what's going to happen next week.

44
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
That's why I'm worried.

45
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I know that you were on the phone downstairs.

46
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I know that you've been watching a lot of TV shows.

47
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Do you watch VTRs?

48
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I have a funny one.

49
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
What is it?

50
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
It's on TX.

51
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Can I borrow it?

52
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
It's funny.

53
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
What is it?

54
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
The air bag in the car.

55
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
The one that inflates?

56
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Why is it funny?

57
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
The comedians are dying.

58
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
What?

59
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
We started this program today.

60
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Before the time changes.

61
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
You were doing a story from last night, right?

62
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Yes, I was.

63
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
From now on.

64
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
There's also a time limit.

65
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
If you keep it up,

66
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
we'll have to take a break again.

67
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
The title of the story doesn't really fit.

68
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
It's called the upside down word quiz.

69
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Let's take a look.

70
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Ladies and gentlemen.

71
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Hello.

72
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I don't really have anything to say.

73
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
But I don't smell bad at all.

74
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
There's a lot of talk about the refugee issue on TV.

75
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
In this song,

76
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
they talk about saving the earth.

77
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
They've been talking about saving the refugees.

78
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
There's no food.

79
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
There's nothing to eat.

80
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
They're all so poor.

81
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
There are things that we should do.

82
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:47,000
They want to see the flies that are on their faces.

83
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
They're irritated.

84
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
They don't know what to do.

85
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Are they angry?

86
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
They're not going to fly away.

87
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
That's crazy.

88
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
But it can't be helped.

89
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
They're all so poor.

90
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
They're so fat.

91
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
They're all being fooled.

92
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
They don't have anything to eat.

93
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
They're so weak.

94
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
They don't have a lot of strength.

95
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
They're doing something.

96
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
That's a different kind of energy.

97
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
They're being fooled.

98
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
They talk about rich Japan.

99
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I think Japan is richer than Japan.

100
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
That's true.

101
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Even if you're watching a TV show, it costs a lot of money.

102
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
That's a good point.

103
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
It's like a quiz show.

104
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
A quiz show costs a lot of money.

105
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
You get a prize of 1 or 2 million yen.

106
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
But today, we're doing a quiz.

107
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
This is Hamada-san.

108
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
He's been here for a while.

109
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Good luck today.

110
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Your daughter is here today.

111
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
That's right.

112
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Where is she?

113
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
She's over there on the left.

114
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Good luck, dad.

115
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Good luck.

116
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Dad, good luck.

117
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Where are you from?

118
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I'm from Momoya.

119
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
It's easy to understand.

120
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I was a little nervous.

121
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Good luck, Hamada-san.

122
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Hamada-san, do your best.

123
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Do you want to go there?

124
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Do you want to go there?

125
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Do your best.

126
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
What do you mean?

127
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Do you want to go to America?

128
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Do you want to go there?

129
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Where is that?

130
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Today, we're going to the corner over there.

131
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
We're going there.

132
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Good luck, Hamada-san.

133
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Do you want to go there?

134
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
You have to get it right.

135
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
What?

136
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
That corner looks good.

137
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Do you want to go to that corner?

138
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I'll definitely get it right.

139
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
You'll definitely get it right.

140
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
That's nonsense.

141
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Good luck with the first question.

142
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Today's first question is very easy.

143
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
What is it?

144
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
You have to answer it in reverse.

145
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
You have to answer it in reverse.

146
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
If you answer it in reverse, you'll get it right.

147
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
It's very easy.

148
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
It's easy, isn't it?

149
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Let's practice.

150
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
For example, what is the height of this?

151
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
It's low.

152
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
It's low.

153
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
How far is it?

154
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
It's close.

155
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
It's close.

156
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
This is Hamada-san's problem.

157
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
What?

158
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Hamada-san is coming from the first round.

159
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Hamada-san is coming from the first round.

160
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Let's go to the first quiz.

161
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
First question.

162
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Let's go to the first quiz.

163
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Jageran.

164
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
What is the height of this?

165
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
It's low.

166
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
It's close.

167
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
How far is it?

168
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
It's close.

169
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
It's close.

170
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Wait a minute.

171
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Wait a minute.

172
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
What are you doing?

173
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
What is the word in reverse?

174
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
It's high.

175
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
It's low.

176
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
It's close.

177
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
It's close.

178
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
What is the word in reverse?

179
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
What is the word in reverse?

180
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
You have to answer it in reverse.

181
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Let's hear what is in reverse.

182
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I can't understand it.

183
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
This is Marimbulu Quiz, what is this?

184
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Okada-san, ask me again.

185
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Could you listen to me?

186
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Answer no one.

187
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
What is the word in reverse?

188
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Marimbulu Quiz.

189
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
You don't know, right?

190
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Did you mention a quiz to 100 people?

191
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
You need to tell me the answer the same message.

192
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Did you mention a quiz to 100 people?

193
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Yes.

194
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
What is Marimbulu?

195
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
It's the Marimba quiz.

196
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Please do your best, Hamada-san.

197
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Hamada-san, that is...

198
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Do your best?

199
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
You know that there are 100 people, right?

200
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Yes, I know.

201
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Our staff went around and asked 100 people.

202
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
The answer is the most.

203
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
That is the answer as it is.

204
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
You said that before.

205
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Yes, I want you to do your best.

206
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I'll do my best.

207
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
That's good.

208
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Then, today's question.

209
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
In Shibuya,

210
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
there are 200 people who are listening to Oakman.

211
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Why is that?

212
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I'm telling you to listen!

213
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
What should I do?

214
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Hamada-san, you have to listen to the question until the end.

215
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
So, I asked 100 people who are listening.

216
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
100 people?

217
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
100 people?

218
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,000
They didn't answer, so I asked again.

219
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
You have to listen to the question until the end.

220
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Dad, listen to the question!

221
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I'll do my best.

222
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Do your best.

223
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I'll do my best.

224
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Say it.

225
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
It's like they are welcoming me.

226
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I'll do my best.

227
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I asked 100 people, but they didn't answer.

228
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
One more question.

229
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I asked 100 people after they answered.

230
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I asked 100 people who were listening to Oakman,

231
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
but they didn't answer.

232
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
How are you doing recently?

233
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:50,000
How are you doing recently?

234
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Are you laughing?

235
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Hamada-san.

236
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Hamada-san!

237
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,000
How are you doing recently?

238
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Hamada-san.

239
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
How are you doing recently?

240
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Dad, listen to the question!

241
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I'll do my best.

242
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
How are you doing recently?

243
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I'll do my best.

244
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
How are you doing recently?

245
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
How are you doing recently?

246
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Dad, listen to the question!

247
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I'll do my best.

248
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
How are you doing recently?

249
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Say it.

250
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Answer me.

251
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
How are you doing recently?

252
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I asked 100 people, but they didn't answer.

253
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Blue Sky Quiz!

254
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
What is the Blue Sky Quiz?

255
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
It's time for the Blue Sky Quiz.

256
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I'll do my best.

257
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Your quiz has changed a lot.

258
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Thank you.

259
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Hamada-san, do you know what the Santa Quiz is?

260
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Yes.

261
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
You know it, right?

262
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
It's one of the three.

263
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,000
This Blue Sky Quiz is 20 questions.

264
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I'll do my best.

265
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
It's even more difficult!

266
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
It's even more difficult!

267
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Think about it.

268
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
The question is very easy.

269
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
What is it?

270
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Don't say it!

271
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Let's talk about the question first.

272
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
What is it?

273
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Today's question is very easy.

274
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I think you can get angry if you make fun of it.

275
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
The question is...

276
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,000
What is the name of the current Prime Minister of Japan?

277
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Is that okay?

278
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Of course.

279
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
You can think of his name, right?

280
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
You can think of his name, right?

281
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Of course I got it.

282
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Wait a minute.

283
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
The staff came up with 20 questions.

284
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
You have to answer them.

285
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
When you get the answer,

286
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
it's your turn.

287
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
You don't have to rush.

288
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
That's right.

289
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
You know it, right?

290
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I know it.

291
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Excuse me.

292
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
It's a river, isn't it?

293
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
It's okay, isn't it?

294
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
It's a river.

295
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I'll do my best.

296
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
There are 20 questions.

297
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
When you get the answer,

298
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
it's your turn.

299
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I got it.

300
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Let's start.

301
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Yamashita.

302
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Kato.

303
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Kubo.

304
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Hagino.

305
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Nishio.

306
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
John.

307
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
That's definitely wrong.

308
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Takeda.

309
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Kaifu.

310
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Wait a minute.

311
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
That's your turn.

312
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
It's your turn.

313
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Okay.

314
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Go ahead.

315
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Kaifu.

316
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Yamano, please answer with your number.

317
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Say it first.

318
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Say it first.

319
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I got it.

320
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Say it first.

321
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
It's Kaifu.

322
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
How many times have I forgotten?

323
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
If you don't remember this,

324
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
you can't do the Blue Sky Quiz.

325
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
You're lying.

326
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
You told me to answer with my number.

327
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
You said so many names.

328
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Why didn't you say it with your number?

329
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Do you understand?

330
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Spring, summer, autumn,

331
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
what is this?

332
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I don't understand.

333
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Spring, summer, autumn,

334
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
this is today's last quiz.

335
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Do your best.

336
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
You don't understand.

337
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Do your best.

338
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I'll do my best.

339
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Today's quiz is very easy.

340
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Here's the question.

341
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Ta-da.

342
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Today,

343
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
October 10th,

344
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
what is the weather like in Tokyo?

345
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
It's hot.

346
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
It's hot.

347
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
It's hot.

348
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
It's hot.

349
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
It's hot.

350
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
It's hot.

351
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
It's hot.

352
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
It's hot.

353
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
It's hot.

354
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
It's hot.

355
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
It's hot.

356
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
You say it.

357
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
You've been giving me questions,

358
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
but you haven't given me an answer.

359
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
You always give me an answer.

360
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
You answer today.

361
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
You answer.

362
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
You answer the question.

363
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I got it, Yamano.

364
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I'll give you some time to think.

365
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
You can go outside and look.

366
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
That's not the problem.

367
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I'm grateful for that time.

368
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
The person in front of the TV is making fun of you.

369
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Why don't you understand this?

370
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Today,

371
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
you're

372
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
a loser.

373
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
You're a loser.

374
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I don't understand.

375
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I got it.

376
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
The answer is

377
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
rain.

378
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
The answer is

379
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
sunny.

380
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
The answer is

381
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
cloudy.

382
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I'll leave it to the editor.

383
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
You're back.

384
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Yes.

385
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Look.

386
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
The program

387
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
has given you

388
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
such a big prank.

389
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Oh, is that so?

390
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Congratulations.

391
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Is this from Nihon TV?

392
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Nihon TV.

393
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Dantan.

394
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
It's a staff member

395
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
in Gaki no Tsukai Arahen.

396
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
And here.

397
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Yoshimoto Kogyo.

398
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Team Zero.

399
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
This is

400
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
easy to ride.

401
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Yes.

402
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Was it expensive?

403
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Well,

404
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Dantan.

405
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Yes.

406
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
How much was it?

407
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
It was expensive.

408
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
How much was it?

409
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
How much was it?

410
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Say it.

411
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
10,000 yen.

412
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
10,000 yen?

413
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Is this

414
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
worth 10,000 yen?

415
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Well,

416
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I've been living here.

417
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
What?

418
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
You guys?

419
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Yes.

420
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
You went to live here?

421
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Yes.

422
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
For Mr. Matsumoto.

423
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I see.

424
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Where did you go to live?

425
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I went to Shikoku.

426
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Next.

427
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
We talked on the phone with the kids.

428
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Yes.

429
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
We watched this video.

430
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
This.

431
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
This program is very popular.

432
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I'm grateful for that.

433
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Yes.

434
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
These days,

435
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I don't usually appear on TV.

436
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
But,

437
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
it's not very interesting.

438
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Well,

439
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
movies are popular these days.

440
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Is that so?

441
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Yes.

442
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
The same goes for videos.

443
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
If you have a rental car,

444
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
you can watch movies all the time.

445
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
But,

446
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
movies are hard to make.

447
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
It's hard to make one.

448
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
In the past,

449
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I was

450
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
the main actor of Ogata.

451
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I was moved.

452
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Of course!

453
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
You know,

454
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
this video has some important words.

455
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
What can I say?

456
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
It's difficult!

457
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
At least,

458
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I think that

459
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I didn't write them correctly.

460
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,600
Let me say it again.

461
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,000
The same result with Japanese movies.

462
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I don't know whom the Cat Ohashi

463
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
is.

464
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I'm sorry.

465
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Why would a character

466
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
of Ogata

467
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
have to be gets the wrong name?

468
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
TEGAWA is

469
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
the same as another character of Ogata.

470
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I think it's quiteware.

471
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Is者

472
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
What kind of picture are you drawing?

473
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
It's funny.

474
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
From O-bun to Ogata prefecture, the ass is up.

475
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I drew it and it's over.

476
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Idiot!

477
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
What?

478
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I've been drawing the ass all the time, and it's over.

479
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
It's funny.

480
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I'm more interested in radio now.

481
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Oh yeah?

482
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Radio is like a child's phone call.

483
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
It's pretty popular.

484
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I can't ask.

485
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Things that my friends don't understand.

486
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Things that are a little hard to ask my parents.

487
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I see.

488
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Hello?

489
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Yes?

490
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Hello?

491
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
This is Hamada Nii-san.

492
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
What's wrong?

493
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Hello?

494
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Answer me!

495
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
You said it's a child's phone call.

496
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Hello?

497
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I don't know if it's a voice message or not.

498
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Don't come over there.

499
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
It's a little smaller.

500
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Smaller?

501
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Yes.

502
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Hello?

503
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
This is Hamada Nii-san.

504
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Hello?

505
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Hello?

506
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Hello?

507
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Hello?

508
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Hello?

509
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
What's your name?

510
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Matsumoto.

511
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Matsumoto-kun.

512
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
What's your name?

513
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Sato.

514
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Sato-kun.

515
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
What's your name?

516
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Matsumoto.

517
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Is it Matsumoto-kun?

518
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Matsumoto-kun?

519
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Yes.

520
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
What's your name?

521
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Sato.

522
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Sato-kun?

523
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Yes.

524
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Sato-kun?

525
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Yes.

526
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Matsumoto-kun?

527
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Yes.

528
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Is it Matsumoto-kun?

529
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Yes.

530
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Where is Sato-kun?

531
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Yes.

532
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
What are you?

533
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Matsumoto Sato.

534
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Is your name Sato?

535
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Yes.

536
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:48,000
This is so funny.

537
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
You.

538
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Why didn't you say Sato-kun is hot?

539
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Hello?

540
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Hello?

541
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Well.

542
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
What's wrong?

543
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I have something to ask you.

544
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
What is it?

545
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Recently, there is a movie called...

546
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I think it's called Ikaiyo.

547
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
What should I eat?

548
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Ask your mother.

549
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Don't call me all the time.

550
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
If you call me that much, your mother will be angry.

551
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I don't know what to say.

552
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I'm so busy.

553
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I'm sorry.

554
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
You should ask your mother.

555
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I'll ask you something childish.

556
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Why is your neck so long?

557
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
That's a good question.

558
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
This is the first time.

559
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
This is a neck...

560
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
No, it's not a neck.

561
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
It's called a neck.

562
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Don't laugh.

563
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I don't want to laugh.

564
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:59,000
It's called a neck because it's very relaxing.

565
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,000
That's why I can't wait for the snacks at 3 o'clock.

566
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
My neck is so long.

567
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
It's true.

568
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
It's true.

569
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
It's true.

570
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Who is the turtle?

571
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:23,000
It's not me.

572
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
It's me.

573
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
It's not you.

574
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,000
It's a snake.

575
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
It's like this.

576
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
It's like this.

577
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
What are you doing?

578
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
It's like this.

579
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
What are you doing?

580
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
It's like this.

581
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,000
You're a fool.

582
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
If you say complicated things, I'll be in trouble.

583
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I'll call your brother.

584
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Hello, I'd like to ask you a question.

585
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
What do you want to ask?

586
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,000
It's the same thing.

587
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
No one calls a girl like this.

588
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Brother?

589
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Say it.

590
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Hello, I'd like to ask you a question.

591
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:29,000
It's the same thing.

592
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I'd like to ask you a question.

593
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Why is the door open?

594
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Get out of here.

595
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Hello.

596
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Hello.

597
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Hello.

598
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I'd like to ask you a question.

599
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
What is it?

600
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I'll explain it to you.

601
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
I'd like to ask you a question.

602
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I'm Matsumoto's sister.

603
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
I'm not your sister.

604
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I'm Matsumoto's brother.

605
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I'd like to ask you a question.

606
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
What is it?

607
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Well...

608
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I'm sorry, but I have a catchphrase.

609
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
What?

610
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,000
You don't have a catchphrase.

611
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I'm doing a lot of things.

612
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
I don't use catchphrases.

613
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
I speak politely.

614
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Hello, what's wrong?

615
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
I'm your brother.

616
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Are you okay?

617
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I'm okay.

618
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Is the catchphrase okay?

619
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
It's okay.

620
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Hello.

621
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
What is it?

622
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Well...

623
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I'd like to ask you a question.

624
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
How can a baby be born?

625
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I see.

626
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
How can a baby be born?

627
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
It's a baby.

628
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Hey!

629
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
What kind of phone call is that?

630
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
It's a baby.

631
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
It's a baby.

632
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
It's a very childlike answer.

633
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
It's a childlike answer.

634
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Hello, what's wrong?

635
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Hello, brother.

636
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Yes.

637
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
I'd like to ask you a question.

638
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Yes.

639
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
How does a dog bark?

640
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Hmm...

641
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
That's a great question.

642
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Is it a great question?

643
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
You're very tired.

644
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
I see.

645
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Yes.

646
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
How does a dog bark?

647
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
That's right.

648
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
This is a very difficult question.

649
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Is that so?

650
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
That's why I'll look it up.

651
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Don't hang up. Wait.

652
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Okay.

653
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
I'm sorry.

654
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I'll be out soon.

655
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Okay.

656
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Wait for me.

657
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Okay.

658
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Don't hang up your phone.

659
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Who's calling?

660
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Who's calling?

661
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Hello?

662
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Is that clear?

663
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:46,000
...

664
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
That was the last one!

665
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
It's over.

666
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
It's over.

667
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Time flies.

668
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
There's still more.

669
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Yeah.

670
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
There's still more.

671
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
There's still more.

672
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Next time I'll take a break.

673
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
You should take a break.

674
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
We're not breaking up.

675
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I don't know if I'm going to be attacked.

676
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:20,000
I don't want to get hurt because of this song.

677
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
But I don't want to get hurt because of this song.

678
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
That's enough!

679
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Thank you for watching.
