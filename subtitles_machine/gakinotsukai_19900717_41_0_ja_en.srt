1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
So today, it's not just us, it's also a lecture

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The teacher is here too

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Hentou Teikaku-san!

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
You're talking!

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I think it's time to start the lecture

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Wait a minute!

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
What is it?

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
The teacher is going to do it next time!

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Even if you start talking, I won't understand

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I don't understand

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
What do you mean you don't understand?

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The point is...

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Hentou is here

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Ah, you're going here too?

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Please stand here

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
What is this?

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
This is the teacher, Hentou

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Ah, that's amazing

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Then, from here...

20
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Then, from here...

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Then, from here...

22
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
But I'm strict

23
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Actually, do you know that I have an English school?

24
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
That's right

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
What floor is this?

26
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
This way?

27
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
It's in Shibuya

28
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Who is that teacher?

29
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Hentou International Academy

30
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Who is that teacher?

31
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
It's on the 6th floor of the building in the back

32
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Who is that teacher?

33
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Hello

34
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Hello

35
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
You!

36
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Hama-chan, you're good!

37
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Give her a round of applause!

38
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Thank you

39
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Then...

40
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Hello, right?

41
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Wait a minute, I'm a little confused

42
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Why?

43
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
This is a very polite greeting

44
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
From now on, I'm going to make a cry of an animal from America

45
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I want you to guess what animal it is

46
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Is that okay?

47
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Baa!

48
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Baa!

49
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
This is different

50
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
This is more like an impersonation than an English word

51
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
This is definitely not a sheep

52
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Is this a hook?

53
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
It's a hook

54
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
What is it?

55
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
It's a reindeer!

56
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Reindeer?

57
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Do reindeer cry?

58
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
No

59
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Now?

60
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
No

61
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
No

62
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Just now I said Baa

63
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Baa

64
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Baa

65
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Baa

66
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Baa

67
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Can you say Baa?

68
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I said Baa!

69
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
You didn't say it

70
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Kento!

71
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Baa will come out, so listen

72
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Baa, Baa, black sheep, have you any wool?

73
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Black ship

74
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Say it!

75
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
You just said black sheep

76
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
You just said it!

77
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Is that okay?

78
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
You're saying animal

79
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
A ship is a ship

80
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Black ship

81
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
That's right

82
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
That's a black ship

83
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I said black sheep

84
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Isn't it sheep?

85
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Sheep

86
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
What?

87
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Sheep

88
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
What?

89
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Sheep

90
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
That's correct!

91
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
It's sheep

92
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Teacher

93
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Teacher, we have a question for you

94
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Hey!

95
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Are you kidding me?

96
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Are you kidding me?

97
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Are you kidding me?

98
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Come on!

99
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Are you kidding me?

100
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
That's why I'm putting this here

101
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Okay, okay

102
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
What should we do?

103
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
We will use our bodies

104
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
to do body action

105
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Kento, look here

106
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
We will do this

107
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Do we do this in English?

108
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
We have to do it with our bodies

109
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
We can't make a voice, right?

110
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
We can

111
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Excuse me

112
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Today is an English lesson

113
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Just say the words you know

114
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
in English

115
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
In English

116
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Okay, come on, come on

117
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
This is it

118
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
This is it

119
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Laura

120
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
That's Japanese!

121
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
It's Laura!

122
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I said it

123
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
So

124
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
There's no other choice

125
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
It seems like you don't know

126
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Excuse me

127
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I need a little bit more help

128
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
So could you do it one more time please?

129
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Please one more time

130
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
That's right

131
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Say it again

132
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
That's right

133
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Say it again

134
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Okay

135
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I don't know what you're saying

136
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I don't know

137
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I don't look like this guy today

138
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Right?

139
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I don't know

140
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Okay

141
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Okay

142
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I think I know

143
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I think I know

144
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Is this Mr. Saejo Hideki?

145
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Correct

146
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Should we do it in English?

147
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Leave it to me

148
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Right?

149
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
This kind of

150
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Let's say

151
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Let's say it's a short sentence

152
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Okay?

153
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Okay

154
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Don't use Japanese

155
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Okay, come on

156
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Fuck!

157
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I'm really sorry

158
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I apologize in place of the main character

159
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
The entertainer

160
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
What?

161
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
You're late for the time

162
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
You're late for the time

163
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
You should have given everyone a bottle of juice

164
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Ladies and gentlemen

165
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Thank you

166
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Hello everyone

167
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
What?

168
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
What is it?

169
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
It's good

170
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
It's good

171
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Oh my

172
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
What's wrong?

173
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
The juice is working

174
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Recently the staff

175
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Wanted to do it

176
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Idiot

177
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
What is it?

178
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Please take it

179
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
20,000 yen

180
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Why is it 20,000 yen?

181
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
It's 200

182
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
200?

183
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
You said 150

184
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
One by one

185
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
One by one

186
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
One by one

187
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
One by one

188
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
One by one

189
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
One by one

190
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
One by one

191
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
One by one

192
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
What kind of juice is that?

193
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
It contains 50% of the juice

194
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
50%?

195
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Hey

196
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Hey Nitta

197
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Nitta, Nitta

198
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Yes, yes

199
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Yes

200
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
This is my bag

201
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
It's good

202
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
What?

203
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I don't know how much you have

204
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Change your clothes

205
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
What is it?

206
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
You don't even want to do it

207
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
This is my bag

208
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I don't know

209
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Give it to me

210
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Give it to me

211
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I can open it

212
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I know

213
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Why do I always put my wallet here?

214
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I don't know

215
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Give it to me

216
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I'll open it for you

217
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Give me 20,000 yen

218
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Wait

219
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Give me your license

220
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
20,000 yen

221
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Don't read my license

222
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Don't step on it

223
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
You

224
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
It's like we're having a date

225
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
How much is it?

226
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
It says 20,000 yen

227
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
10 dollars

228
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Hey

229
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
This is my wallet's protective paper

230
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
What is that?

231
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I always put this in

232
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I can't lose money

233
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Is that so?

234
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
After doing this

235
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
That's good

236
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
20,000 yen

237
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
You're so stingy

238
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
By the way, how much money do you have in your wallet today?

239
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I'll show you

240
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Stop it

241
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
You have a lot

242
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
You have a lot

243
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Why do you have so much money?

244
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
It's not like that

245
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
What is it?

246
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Are you planning to do that again?

247
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I don't know

248
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Hey

249
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Why do you have so much money?

250
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
It's not like that

251
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Why are you so stingy today?

252
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Today?

253
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
When did today start?

254
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I don't know

255
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
20,000 yen

256
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
You can't do that in front of the TV

257
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
It's not like that

258
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I have a lot of money

259
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Give me 20,000 yen

260
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
It's not like that

261
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Fresh gag

262
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Don't be so stingy

263
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
My wallet

264
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
What is it?

265
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Give it to me

266
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
You're making fun of me

267
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I'm just kidding

268
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
20,000 yen

269
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
20,000 yen

270
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Thank you

271
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Why are you saying thank you?

272
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Are you going to give it to them?

273
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Taste it

274
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I'm not drinking it

275
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I'm not thirsty

276
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Open it

277
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
This is

278
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Thank you

279
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
What are you talking about?

280
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
There is this thing called Pocon

281
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
There is no Pocon

282
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
It would be great if we could do it together

283
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
It would be great

284
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I don't want to say it if we do it together

285
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I don't know

286
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Hey

287
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I don't know

288
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Hey

289
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Hey

290
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I don't know

291
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Taste it

292
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Taste it

293
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:09,000
You did it

294
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
You fulfilled your promise

295
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
That's right

296
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
We can proceed with the program

297
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Everyone is drinking and listening to me

298
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
It's like I'm inviting them to a dinner show

299
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Is it that good?

300
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
What?

301
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
It's 100 yen

302
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I don't know what to do

303
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
It's your fault

304
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
What?

305
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Let's do it when I get older

306
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Do it

307
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
When I get older

308
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
What do you mean when you get older?

309
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
It's when you are older than me

310
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
It's not like that

311
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
There is a time

312
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
That's right

313
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Like today, it's 3.30

314
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
It's 31 minutes

315
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
That's right

316
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
It's 3.30

317
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:03,000
When I become a high-ranking talent

318
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Well, recently

319
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I don't think I'm popular

320
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Hey

321
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
People tell me

322
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I can do whatever I want

323
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I really can't do it

324
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
They just come out and shout

325
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
They just shout

326
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
They don't shout even if I ask them to

327
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Even if you ask them to?

328
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Even if I ask them to, they don't shout

329
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Have you ever tried it?

330
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I haven't, but I know how to do it

331
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
How do you know?

332
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Even if they shout

333
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
What?

334
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Even if they shout

335
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Even if I ask them to, they don't shout

336
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
That's not what I meant

337
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
It's because I've seen it on TV

338
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
You can say that because you have experience

339
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I don't have experience

340
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
You said that's not what you meant

341
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
It's different from this

342
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
You can't misunderstand that

343
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:19,000
The reason I shout is because I'm a high-ranking talent

344
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
If someone else comes out

345
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
For example?

346
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
For example, if there are 100 fans in downtown

347
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
And I walk around

348
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Everyone will come

349
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
But who would it be now?

350
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Who?

351
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Who's popular now?

352
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Who?

353
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
An actor?

354
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Who do you like?

355
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Toshi-chan?

356
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Toshi-chan?

357
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Toshi-chan

358
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
That's what this kid said

359
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
That's cold

360
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
This kid likes Toshi-chan

361
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Why are you here?

362
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Right?

363
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Toshi-chan came

364
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I followed him

365
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
100 fans gathered

366
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
They came

367
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
They said, Toshi-chan

368
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Toshi-chan was worried

369
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Toshi-chan came

370
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
90 people came

371
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
That's a lot

372
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Don't say 90 people

373
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
All of them

374
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
There are a lot of people

375
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I have something to say

376
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
There are 5 people left

377
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
95 people went over there

378
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
The remaining 5 people

379
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
There are 4 people who are your fans

380
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
It's me

381
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Wait

382
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
You can say whatever you want

383
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
What are you talking about?

384
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
That one person

385
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
He dropped his glasses

386
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I don't know what's going on

387
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Wait

388
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
That person

389
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Yokoyama Yasushi

390
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
You're more popular after you got married

391
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Are you stupid?

392
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
That's not true

393
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
You're more popular

394
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
That's not true

395
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
You're more popular

396
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
You should work hard in Tokyo

397
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I don't think so

398
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
You're more popular

399
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Are you planning something?

400
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I'm not

401
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
You're making fun of me

402
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I'm serious

403
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
You're cute when you talk like this

404
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Are you kidding me?

405
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I'm serious

406
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:41,000
You're cute when you talk like this

407
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I'm serious

408
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I'm serious

409
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I don't think I can get close to you

410
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
How did you become popular?

411
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I saw you on TV

412
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I became popular because of you

413
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I didn't do anything

414
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I went to the disco and everyone was dancing

415
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I went to the disco and everyone was dancing

416
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I'm the Yakuza after the war

417
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
What?

418
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
You did it that way

419
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I want you to come to me

420
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I want you to come to me

421
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I've always been a dandy Omomochi

422
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Why don't you say it yourself?

423
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Why don't you say it yourself?

424
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:40,000
You're always shy

425
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
You're always shy

426
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Really?

427
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
What should I do?

428
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
What?

429
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
What should I do?

430
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,000
When people say bad things about me on TV

431
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I get mad

432
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I get mad on TV but I'm normal

433
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I'm normal when I talk

434
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
That's why I'm a dandy

435
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I'm not a dandy

436
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I thought you were scary

437
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
But you're not

438
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
When I went to the golf course

439
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I was being pulled by the caddy

440
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
You were scared

441
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I was scared

442
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I was scared

443
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Everyone was asking me what number I was

444
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I said 7

445
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I said 7

446
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I said, yes, and he went like this

447
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
It's completely different from TV

448
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I thought he would say it more

449
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
And then he went like this

450
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
He's kinder than I thought

451
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I said, yes, and he ran off

452
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
What number is the next one?

453
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
5, and he went like this

454
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
At first, he was already trembling

455
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
He was like, Kazan-kai!

456
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
And he had a bow

457
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
And then he went like this

458
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Why?!

459
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I'm like Non-non

460
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
There's that thing

461
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
It's like this

462
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
It's like that

463
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Sorry

464
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Didn't you say Non-non?

465
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
It's Non-no

466
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
It's not Non-non

467
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
If you say Non-non, it's Moomin's this

468
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Let's do the writing

469
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Writing

470
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Yes

471
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Yes, yes

472
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Let's ask the audience tonight

473
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Who's your favorite talent?

474
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Who's my favorite talent?

475
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Tama-san

476
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
What do you like about me?

477
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Don't be shy

478
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
What do you like about me?

479
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Don't be shy

480
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I'm a fan of Downtown

481
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I'm saying that I'm a fan of Downtown

482
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Why are you like that?

483
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
You guys

484
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
If I were told that, I'd say,

485
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Why Matsumoto?

486
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I wouldn't say that

487
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Where should I write?

488
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
All of them

489
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
All of them

490
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Who's the one without a box?

491
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Thank you

492
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
All of them

493
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Face

494
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Face?

495
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
You're like

496
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
You're like a codfish's lip

497
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Codfish's lip?

498
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Isn't it good?

499
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
There are people like that

500
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I love you as a fan

501
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Please use me

502
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
You have good proportions

503
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Please be careful not to be invited

504
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Thank you

505
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Sorry

506
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Let's move on to the writing

507
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
This person

508
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I've thought of a big bet for Matsumoto and Tama-chan

509
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
What?

510
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
A bet

511
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
There will be an all-star game soon

512
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,000
In that game, who will win?

513
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
It will be held during the summer vacation

514
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
It will be held in a month or two

515
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
What do you think?

516
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
It's good for a bet

517
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Everyone will know

518
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,000
But what will you do if you lose?

519
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
It happened in the past

520
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I appeared on Zoom in Asahi

521
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I appeared on Galala

522
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:19,000
And I appeared on the radio show of Studio Alta

523
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,000
But I know a lot about all-stars

524
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I know that Parry is stronger

525
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:30,000
If I win, I will compete in Parry

526
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
What kind of bet is that?

527
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
If you were going to compete in Parry, we wouldn't have talked about this

528
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
But why?

529
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
It's not that Parry

530
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Don't you want to lose?

531
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I don't

532
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
You were upset when you appeared on Zoom

533
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I was upset because I woke up sleepy

534
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
So let's think about it

535
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Let's think about the punishment

536
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
That's right

537
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Let's go home

538
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
That's enough

539
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
What time is it now?

540
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
8.35

541
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I don't know

542
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Even if you give me juice

543
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,000
I will drink it

544
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
But no one is drinking it

545
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
It's a waste

546
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
It's a waste?

547
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Then don't drink it!

548
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:31,000
What are you going to do if you can't drink it?

549
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
What are you going to do if you can't drink it?

550
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
And the ending

551
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
You can't come here until 9

552
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
I can't make juice

553
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
I don't know how to make juice

554
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
What's the base?

555
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
I will think about it

556
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Without orange juice, you don't know the base

557
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
It's like a cocktail

558
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
I will think about the taste

559
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
I don't know how to make juice

560
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
What is this?

561
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Tanaka Seiji was playing with a toy can

562
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
That's not good

563
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
You can't drink it

564
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
What if you die?

565
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
I won't die

566
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
I have something

567
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
I will think about it

568
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Thank you

569
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
See you next time

570
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
At a place like this

571
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Thank you for the juice

572
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
It cost 20,000 yen

573
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
It's obvious

574
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
It can't be helped

575
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
It cost 20,000 yen

576
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
It's 5,000 yen

577
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
No one is drinking it

578
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
It's okay

579
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
You can take it home

580
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Do you think so?

581
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
I think so

582
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
It's not a punishment game

583
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
What is it?

584
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Money

585
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Why money?

586
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
You didn't wait for it?

587
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I didn't wait

588
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Let's do it

589
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
And

590
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
You wrote a letter

591
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
It's not a punishment game

592
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
You wrote a letter about All-Star

593
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Did you read it?

594
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
I think it's good

595
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Japanese people know about it

596
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Let's do it next time

597
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Next time

598
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
I don't know who will be on it

599
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Let's ask the staff to put it on the board

600
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Let's do it

601
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Next week

602
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Let's think about the punishment game

603
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
That's all

604
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
We only need the staff

605
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
See you next time

606
00:22:47,000 --> 00:23:13,000
