1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Which one of you is a fan of Tsukishiki?

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Hey!

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Sorry, sorry.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Today, we have a monitor.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
We'll put in the audience.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
The people who came to see us today.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
They'll come in.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
While we're watching.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
This is your fan, right?

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
They came in!

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
This is my fan.

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
We'll decide on 3 people.

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Then we'll go to the stage again.

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
And we'll give it to them.

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Wait a minute.

16
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
You're my fan.

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
What kind of image do you have of my fans?

18
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
That's...

19
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
It's tough?

20
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
It's tough.

21
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:57,000
This program is brought to you by these sponsors.

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
This is your fan.

23
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
There's no mistaking it.

24
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
This isn't anyone's fan.

25
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
No, it's definitely yours.

26
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Someone brought it.

27
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Even if someone brought it.

28
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm wearing it because I want to see someone.

29
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I want to see you.

30
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'll check this out.

31
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
This isn't me.

32
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
This is Bu-chan.

33
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Pink Bu-chan.

34
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I'm really into Bu-chan rice.

35
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Rice?

36
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
This is your fan.

37
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
It's tough.

38
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
It's your fan.

39
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
This is your fan.

40
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
This?

41
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Really?

42
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
This kind of thing...

43
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
It's tough.

44
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
It's like a comedian's jacket.

45
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
It's cool.

46
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I definitely want to draw you.

47
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
You mean me?

48
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Yeah.

49
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Is that so?

50
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
This young man is definitely like that.

51
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
What is this?

52
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
It looks like an old man.

53
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Whose jacket is this?

54
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
It's a matchmaker.

55
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
It's tough.

56
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
This guy looks like a country bumpkin.

57
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:11,000
It looks like an old man.

58
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
It's definitely you.

59
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
The second one is an actor.

60
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I don't know. Stop.

61
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
It's definitely this guy.

62
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
It's my fan.

63
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
It's like a daughter-in-law.

64
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Thank you.

65
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Everyone.

66
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
We were looking at you from above.

67
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
On the monitor.

68
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
We were looking at each of your faces from above.

69
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
There were some people who laughed at the camera.

70
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
There were a lot of people.

71
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
There were a lot of people.

72
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Today, as the title says, which book is it?

73
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
We made a guess.

74
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
The person you think is different from Hamada's fan is...

75
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
3 of C.

76
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
It's you.

77
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
5 of E.

78
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
It's that guy.

79
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
2 of H.

80
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
It's you.

81
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
That's right.

82
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
It's Hamada's fan.

83
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I expected it to be Hamada's fan.

84
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
19 of D.

85
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
19 of D.

86
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
The girl with glasses.

87
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
It's her.

88
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
6 of B.

89
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
You are definitely Hamada's fan.

90
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
That's right.

91
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
11 of D.

92
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
That girl.

93
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
What's your name?

94
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Manjoto.

95
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
My name is Manjoto.

96
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Manjoto?

97
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
That was close.

98
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Whose fan are you?

99
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I'm Hamada's fan.

100
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
What part of Hamada is this?

101
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
The lips.

102
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
What?

103
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Sit down!

104
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
What's your name?

105
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Inagaki.

106
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Who are you?

107
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I'm Hamachan.

108
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
So you want Hamada to do this?

109
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
A little.

110
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
What?

111
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
A woman?

112
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Are you kidding me?

113
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
A woman?

114
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
That's cool.

115
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Do you really have breasts?

116
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Of course I do.

117
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Touch her.

118
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
From here.

119
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
What?

120
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
That's cool.

121
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
That's rude.

122
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I thought it was a fan of Matsumoto, but it was Hamada.

123
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I thought it was a fan of Matsumoto, but it was a woman.

124
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
That's a big mistake.

125
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
What's your name?

126
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I'm Bekehame.

127
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
How old are you?

128
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I'm 21.

129
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
This girl is definitely your fan.

130
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
There's one more thing.

131
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
My heart is not here.

132
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Which one is your fan?

133
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Hamada.

134
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
It's the other way around.

135
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
That's a big mistake.

136
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Is that so?

137
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Is that so?

138
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
She was Hamada's number one fan, right?

139
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
That's right.

140
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
She said,

141
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I'm definitely a fan of Matsumoto.

142
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
That's what she said when she came in.

143
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
What's your name?

144
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Yoshida.

145
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
How old are you?

146
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I'm 22.

147
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
How old are you?

148
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I'm 21.

149
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
How old are you?

150
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I'm 22.

151
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
You're so noisy.

152
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Who are you?

153
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I'm Matsumoto.

154
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Matsumoto?

155
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
That's right.

156
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I have a lot of things I want to ask you.

157
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
What's your name?

158
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I'm Nishida.

159
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
How old are you?

160
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I'm 24.

161
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
How old are you?

162
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I'm Matsumoto.

163
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
See?

164
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
You forgot again.

165
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
You forgot again.

166
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
What is this about?

167
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I thought I wanted to be beaten up.

168
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
This is terrible.

169
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I'm so hot.

170
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
My body is shivering.

171
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
But Rupan-kun...

172
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Rupan-kun!

173
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
What are you doing here?

174
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I didn't expect you to come here today.

175
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I'm not Rupan-kun.

176
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
That's a bit harsh.

177
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I'm not used to this kind of thing.

178
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Really?

179
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
If you squeeze it a bit, it becomes Rupan-kun.

180
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
That's a bit too much.

181
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I have a lot of things I want to ask you.

182
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I'm working on a video right now.

183
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
This is going to be released soon.

184
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
This is interesting.

185
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
You have to buy this for rent.

186
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
This is going to be a long-term storage.

187
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
This is interesting.

188
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I think everyone doesn't know this.

189
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
We debuted and did a lot of manzai.

190
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
We've been putting in a lot of manzai since then.

191
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
We've been putting in a lot of manzai since then.

192
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Yes.

193
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
And between that and that, this is interesting.

194
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I can't stop.

195
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Just remembering doing that is interesting.

196
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I'm crying.

197
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I got a dog-man.

198
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
It's a dog, but it's a robot.

199
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
You're the doctor who made the dog-man?

200
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Yes, I'm Dr. Dog God.

201
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
That's the name.

202
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
It's a dog robot.

203
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
It's just a normal dog.

204
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I got a request from the show.

205
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I wanted to make a dog robot.

206
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
They said it was better to have a dirty dog.

207
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
They said it was better to have a dirty dog.

208
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
They said it was better to have a dirty dog.

209
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I put on a wig and a cape.

210
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I put on a wig and a cape.

211
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I ran away with a cape on.

212
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
It says V on my forehead.

213
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I'm an alien.

214
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I'm a one-handed bug.

215
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I'm a one-handed bug.

216
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I ran away with a wig and a cape.

217
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I ran away with a wig and a cape.

218
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I said, go home.

219
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I looked for a dog for an hour.

220
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I was surprised to see someone walking like that.

221
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
To get on their back.

222
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,000
This is close to finished, so I want you to buy it.

223
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I'm thinking of doing this animal series for a while.

224
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I'm thinking of doing this animal series for a while.

225
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
We'll do a great show.

226
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
We'll do a great show.

227
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Mr. Gorilla

228
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
You're Mr. Gorilla?

229
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
He's a gorilla.

230
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I've been admiring that teacher for a long time.

231
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
But since I was a wild child...

232
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
It would be interesting if I said something good.

233
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I can't say, teacher.

234
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
But I want to do this as an animal series.

235
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I'm a little tired now.

236
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
It's about time to stop talking.

237
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
But this is Tsuyuya, so...

238
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I'm not talking.

239
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Please come out.

240
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Wow! You scared me!

241
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Why?

242
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Why?

243
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Are you hungry?

244
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
What is this?

245
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
It's a gift for someone who won the quiz.

246
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Oh, really?

247
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
It's a prize for me to be on a popular TV show.

248
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Oh!

249
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Did you happen to win this show?

250
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
How was your time with Sanma?

251
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
It was fun.

252
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Oh, really?

253
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
You did comedy, right?

254
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
That's right.

255
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Oh, I see.

256
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Amemaman!

257
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
With Kanpei, right?

258
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Yes, with Kanpei.

259
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Oh, I see.

260
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
What do you think of Kanpei?

261
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
He's a wonderful person.

262
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Do you really think so?

263
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Yes.

264
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Don't Jimmy and Kanpei have something in common?

265
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Oh, really?

266
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Don't they?

267
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Jimmy is cute, but Kanpei...

268
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Is he cute?

269
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
But he really likes sex.

270
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
When he went to Korea, he was doing it for 24 hours.

271
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
The other person was angry.

272
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Let me at least eat something.

273
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
You're a bit too much.

274
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Oh, really?

275
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Thank you very much.

276
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Thank you very much.

277
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I'm sorry.

278
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Oh, I was surprised.

279
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Now, let me introduce him.

280
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,000
This is Takada-san from Itabayashi-ku.

281
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
The other day, I saw him do the Kin-chan run.

282
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
What are you talking about?

283
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Don't say things like that.

284
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I've never seen it before.

285
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I've never seen it either.

286
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,000
On the show, there was a request for people who are good at doing the Kin-chan run.

287
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Hama-chan, please come out.

288
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Hey!

289
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I'll put this in.

290
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:18,000
This is going to be interesting for the first time in a while, isn't it?

291
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
No, it can't be.

292
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
This is going to be interesting for the first time in a while, isn't it?

293
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
It's like this.

294
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Taisho is nervous, so it can't be.

295
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
This is a corner for you.

296
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
He even wrote his address.

297
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
If you can do the Kin-chan run, please come out.

298
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Right?

299
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Please come out.

300
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Please come out.

301
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Before that, you have to do the round rice.

302
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
You can do this right away.

303
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I'll wait for you to do the round rice.

304
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
You don't have to wait.

305
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I'll wait for you.

306
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Don't do that.

307
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Don't do that.

308
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
The Kin-chan run, you're good at it.

309
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I'm not good at it.

310
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
You're good at it.

311
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Hang in there.

312
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
You're good at it.

313
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Are you talking to a stupid kid?

314
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
It's true.

315
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
You're good at it.

316
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I don't need to do the round rice.

317
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
You can't do it.

318
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
You can definitely win.

319
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I'm an amateur.

320
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
What are you talking about?

321
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Are you a pro at the Kin-chan run?

322
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
All the people in front of the Kin-chan run are amateurs.

323
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
In front of the Kin-chan run?

324
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
That's not true.

325
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I want an amateur to do it.

326
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Do it now.

327
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Do it.

328
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
You can do it.

329
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Run.

330
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Come on.

331
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
You can't do it.

332
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
What are you going to do?

333
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Do it.

334
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
You can't do it.

335
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
There's no way you can't do it.

336
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I don't really trust Nostradamus.

337
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I don't know about that.

338
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I don't think he'll quit.

339
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Nostradamus is stubborn.

340
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
He thinks the moon is pointing at something.

341
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Who's pointing at something?

342
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
He lines up the alphabet and reads it upside down.

343
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Why would he read it upside down?

344
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
That's a long story.

345
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I don't think that's true.

346
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I don't think that's true.

347
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Really?

348
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
How many years until Earth?

349
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
How many years until now?

350
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
1,910 years.

351
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
1 year.

352
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
8 years until then.

353
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
What are we going to do?

354
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
What are we going to do?

355
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
What are we going to do?

356
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
We're going to blow it up.

357
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
You know what?

358
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
The big Earth is going to explode.

359
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
It's going to be a mess.

360
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I want you to ride on it.

361
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I want you to ride on it.

362
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Are you sure you want to ride on it?

363
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Of course I am.

364
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I've never seen a place this small.

365
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
You're the only one who's excited.

366
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
There's no one else.

367
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
You're the only one who's excited.

368
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
You want to ride on it.

369
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
You're wrong.

370
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
You're making me angry.

371
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
What's wrong with you?

372
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
What's wrong with you?

373
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
You're wrong.

374
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
What's wrong with you?

375
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
It might be small.

376
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:52,000
But I don't know if it's big enough for me to ride on it.

377
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I'm going to be alone.

378
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I don't know what to do.

379
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
But there's someone over there who's excited.

380
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
There's no one else who can do that.

381
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
What's wrong with you?

382
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
When it explodes,

383
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
who would want to ride on it?

384
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I want to ride on it.

385
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
But I don't know if it's big enough for me to ride on it.

386
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
If it's big enough for you to ride on it,

387
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,000
how are you going to move forward when you're excited?

388
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I don't know.

389
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Can you move forward when you're excited?

390
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I can move forward when I'm excited.

391
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:30,000
You're going to move forward on your own will.

392
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
You don't study the air resistance at all, do you?

393
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I'm asking because I don't know.

394
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
When you go this way, it's like this.

395
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
It's true.

396
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
It's like this in the direction you want to go.

397
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
That's right.

398
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
What don't you know?

399
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
When you want to move forward, you know how to move sideways.

400
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
What do you do when you want to move forward?

401
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I can't move forward.

402
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I can move sideways, but I can't move forward.

403
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:04,000
So if you move forward, you can move forward.

404
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
What do you mean?

405
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
This is sideways, isn't it?

406
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
That's how you do it.

407
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
If you move forward like this,

408
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
if you move a little to the side,

409
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
it's like this.

410
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Don't make it so complicated.

411
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
There's something like this.

412
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
This isn't right.

413
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
What do you do when you want to go backwards?

414
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
That's why.

415
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
That's why it's the same as before.

416
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
What should I do?

417
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Try it.

418
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Next time, do it like this.

419
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Don't lie!

420
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Are you kidding me?

421
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
What are you talking about?

422
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Don't say it.

423
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,000
No one says it's going to explode.

424
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Because in 1999,

425
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,000
something was falling from the sky.

426
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
What was falling?

427
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:05,000
That's why you look like an alien.

428
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Are you laughing?

429
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I'm laughing.

430
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
It's hard.

431
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I'm laughing.

432
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I'm laughing.

433
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
It's falling from a completely different place.

434
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I'm laughing.

435
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
It's falling down.

436
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I'm laughing.

437
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
It's falling down like this.

438
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I don't know what it is.

439
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Are you laughing?

440
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I'm laughing.

441
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
There's nothing wrong with that.

442
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I'm laughing, but what do you say?

443
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I got this land.

444
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I'm laughing.

445
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
But humans are all going to be killed.

446
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Maybe.

447
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I'm sure it's like that.

448
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
It's not my sense.

449
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I'm an alien.

450
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I want to draw with my imagination.

451
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I think I have an eye.

452
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I don't think I have an eye.

453
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I have an eye.

454
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,000
It's a completely selfish human way of thinking.

455
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I don't have an eye.

456
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
What kind of shape is that?

457
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I have two hands and two legs.

458
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I have an eye.

459
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
It's a completely human way of thinking.

460
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I don't think it's like that.

461
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I can't walk like this.

462
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I can't walk.

463
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:17,000
It doesn't even look like a shape.

464
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
What kind of shape is that?

465
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
What?

466
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
It doesn't look like this.

467
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
It doesn't look like this at all.

468
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
It's a lump.

469
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
It's a lump.

470
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,000
But it's a lump, but there's something.

471
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
What is something?

472
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Something like this.

473
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I don't know that.

474
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
What is something like this?

475
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Is that a substitute for a hand?

476
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I don't have a hand.

477
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
What is something like this?

478
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
What?

479
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Where does it come from?

480
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Something like this.

481
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
What is this?

482
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
What?

483
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
What is this?

484
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
It's around here.

485
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
It's around here.

486
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,000
For an alien, it's a big bone.

487
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
What is it?

488
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:09,000
It's a man's bone.

489
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
What is it?

490
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
It's a shape that I don't know.

491
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
It's scary.

492
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
When I first saw it.

493
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
It's scary over there, too.

494
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
When I saw it.

495
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
It's like this.

496
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
That's right.

497
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
It's scary.

498
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
When I saw it for the first time.

499
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
But there was something before.

500
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
An alien that came down from the UFO.

501
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
There was a picture of an alien that was captured like this.

502
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
There was a picture of an alien that was captured like this.

503
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
That's why there aren't a single kind of aliens.

504
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
There are many kinds of them.

505
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,000
That's why the stock is close to humans.

506
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Maybe.

507
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Maybe.

508
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I think my sense is this much.

509
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I think my sense is this much.

510
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
I think my sense is this much.

511
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I think my sense is this much.

512
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:55,000
It's my sense.

513
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
I think to myself,

514
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,000
If there are any living things, it's about this size.

515
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Nothing serious.

516
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:08,000
There are about 50 million people here right now.

517
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Such a small alien.

518
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I don't know if there are about 50 million of them already.

519
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I don't know if there are about 50 million of them already.

520
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
How the hell are they doing, right now.

521
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I don't know if they have already been here.

522
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:23,000
You're so tiny. Even if you had 50 million yen, it would still be scattered all over the place.

523
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
So, I don't think you're going to stick it to someone's ear.

524
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
I don't think so.

525
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
You mean, inside your ears?

526
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

527
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Eh?

528
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Scary.

529
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
You're so tiny.

530
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
I'm sure that such a tiny guy is very shocked right now.

531
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Because he knows it's me.

532
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,000
I don't know if you have something inside your ears.

533
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I don't know.

534
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
I don't know.

535
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,000
So, for example, if you have something under your ear, you would take it off right away, right?

536
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Then, you might have something underneath your ear.

537
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
I would hide it quickly.

538
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
You would hide it quickly.

539
00:21:00,000 --> 00:20:47,880
So, from now on, when you take off your earring, you'll look like a

540
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,000
So, from now on, when you take off your earring, you'll look like a

541
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
No, no, no, no.

542
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
You'll be like a faint.

543
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
You'll be like a faint.

544
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,000
So, from now on, when you take off your earring, you'll look like a

545
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
You'll be relieved.

546
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
You'll be relieved.

547
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Ah, you'll take it off again.

548
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
So, you take it off once and take it off again.

549
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Wow!

550
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
You should do that from now on.

551
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Don't say that!

552
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Don't say that!

553
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
That was a coincidence.

554
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
I'm here!

555
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Hello.

556
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Well, Kin-chan, are you going to run?

557
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Are you leaving already?

558
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
What is that all of a sudden?

559
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
What are you going to do at the end of the show and say, Kin-chan, are you going to run?

560
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
No, no, that's not something I should say today.

561
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
What is it?

562
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Do your best.

563
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,000
No, I'm not going to go to the studio.

564
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Why?

565
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Why are you doing that?

566
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Well, it's not that I'm going to the studio.

567
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I'm going to be quiet in front of the TV.

568
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Is that so?

569
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Well, this is a new thing for you.

570
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Wait a minute.

571
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
The new event is your rice ball, isn't it?

572
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
That's why I'm trying my best.

573
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
I heard that you got the rice ball, too.

574
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Really?

575
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Can I get it?

576
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
It's a rice ball.

577
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
What do you think? Do you have it?

578
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
I'll do my best.

579
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
No, no.

580
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
And I'm going to go to the studio.

581
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
You're going to run, aren't you?

582
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
All right, let's practice.

583
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Next week's opening.

584
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Hold the ground somewhere.

585
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
What are you going to do at the opening next week?

586
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,000
That's why you're going to run all the way on the ground.

587
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
I'll take you to the city.

588
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Are you serious?

589
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Yes, yes, yes.

590
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
With a tire on your waist.

591
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
I'm looking for a postcard and an assistant.

592
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Everything is the same.

593
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
I'll be waiting for you.

594
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Don't forget it.

595
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Goodbye.

596
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,700
Theっ

597
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:07,700
sorry.

598
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:09,700
Oh, boy.

599
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:13,700
If you have thelogland, you can go to the set.

600
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:15,100
Come come come

601
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:19,900
If you have thelogland, you can go to the set.

602
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:22,700
If you have thelogland, you can go to the set.

603
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:24,700
Come come come

604
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:27,140
That's probably what you think.
