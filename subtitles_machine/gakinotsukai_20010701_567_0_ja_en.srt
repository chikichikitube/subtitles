1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
7th Gaki no Tsukaiya Arahen's Tsuke Tsuke Gainojin Tsurisu Tenshuken!

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
We're here, Mr. Tadana.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
We're here.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
It's a big event once a year.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Yes.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
We're going to start right away, so I'd like to introduce you to our guest.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
First, this person.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
He's already 38 years old.

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
He's the fashion leader, but he doesn't even have a face.

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
He doesn't.

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Hamada Masato-san!

12
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Nice to meet you!

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Thank you!

14
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I don't really talk much, so I won't use it.

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm the main fishman.

16
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Please take care of me.

17
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'll do it this year.

18
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Please take care of me.

19
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Next, the man who has the strongest wallet in the entertainment world,

20
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
the comedian Matsumoto Hitoshi!

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Nice to meet you.

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I'll do it today.

23
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'll do it.

24
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'll catch the one I caught on the first day.

25
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Thank you very much!

26
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Next, for the sense of gag, the best in the entertainment world,

27
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
the father gag copywriter, Itoi Shigesato!

28
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I had the impression that you came in early today.

29
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
No, it's not past 8.

30
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
8?

31
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
It's early.

32
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
It's actually 1.30 today.

33
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Thank you!

34
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Next, we have a winner who hasn't been here yet.

35
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
He is the one who came here without a break.

36
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
It's Yosuke Eguchi!

37
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Thank you!

38
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Thank you!

39
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
You still have a chance to win. You will be the 7th winner.

40
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Is that so?

41
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Yes, it is.

42
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
If you don't win today, you won't be able to go to the next round.

43
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I'll do my best.

44
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I'm a little bit tired.

45
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Thank you for your time.

46
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Next, Asakusa is known for Kaminari-mon.

47
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
And this person is Iemon.

48
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
The Yellow Monkey is Yoshii Kazuyama.

49
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Is this year's schedule tight?

50
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
The atmosphere is very good.

51
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
It's been a while since I've been on TV, so I'm really nervous.

52
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Well, do your best.

53
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Thank you.

54
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,780
Next, we have Kato Haruhiko-san, who has been wearing black sesame

55
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:31,000
and senzu since this morning.

56
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Kato-san, you're not very excited, but do your best.

57
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I'm always nervous.

58
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Why are you nervous?

59
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
It feels like I'm in a big entertainment world.

60
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Hey, just say it!

61
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I'm getting scolded.

62
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Do your best today.

63
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Thank you!

64
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
The peak of being a comedian was 10 years ago.

65
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Now, it's the grumpy, Yamazaki Hosei!

66
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I'm a fashion leader.

67
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Where are you from?

68
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Thank you very much.

69
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Thank you very much.

70
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:27,000
And finally, the winner of the previous year, the Grand Champion, Mr. Okuda!

71
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Thank you for waiting.

72
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I'm the winner of the first round. I want you to do your best for the second round.

73
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I don't want to lose.

74
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
You don't want to lose?

75
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I'm a little bit nervous.

76
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I'm a little bit nervous.

77
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I'm nervous.

78
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
This time, we have a close contact with foreign TV stations.

79
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Really?

80
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
What do you mean?

81
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Oh, you're here.

82
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
You were filming Mr. Mitao's dance.

83
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Where is that crew from?

84
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
It's the Central Government of Africa.

85
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
You're totally out of it.

86
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
You're too close.

87
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
There's a camera here too.

88
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
You're too close.

89
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Think about it.

90
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
It's definitely not the way to hold the camera.

91
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
You're laughing.

92
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
You're always in the scene.

93
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
What scene?

94
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
You're like Pan Sen from the sky.

95
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
It's old.

96
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
The type is old.

97
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Now, the tournament will start soon.

98
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
From the chairman of the tournament, Naoki Tanaka,

99
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I would like to announce the tournament.

100
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
From now on,

101
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Please repeat after me.

102
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Something like us.

103
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Please.

104
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
People like us...

105
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Have no sense at all!

106
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
People like us...

107
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Especially me...

108
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Can't even get a laugh...

109
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,000
But I'll do my best!

110
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I'm sorry I was born.

111
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I'm sorry I was born.

112
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Anyway, the competition is about to begin!

113
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Go for the championship!

114
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Thank you very much!

115
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Jack's father is a bit upset.

116
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Why?

117
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:48,000
The 7th GENERATION FISHING CHAMPIONSHIP

118
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
This program is brought to you by the following sponsors

119
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
In the midst of the great weather, the 7th GENERATION FISHING CHAMPIONSHIP has finally begun

120
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
The spirit is enough, the battle to become the champion is being held

121
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
At the start, this man's rod has been lost

122
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
It's coming!

123
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Look!

124
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Yamasaki's sudden hit!

125
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Hey, look!

126
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Look!

127
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
This year's not going to be easy!

128
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
On the other hand, the Hamada, Okuda, and Yoshi team

129
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
This team also hit Okuda early on

130
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Oh, the cod is coming

131
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
The cod is coming

132
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
The cod is big

133
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
It's big

134
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Hey hey hey!

135
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Seriously?

136
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
And the loser, Hamada.

137
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
It's okay, it's okay.

138
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
It's big.

139
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
It's coming.

140
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
It's coming?

141
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Hello.

142
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Another one.

143
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Yoshi is not here yet.

144
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
It's the same as usual.

145
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Hello!

146
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Wow!

147
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
It's huge!

148
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
No, it's small.

149
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
It's small!

150
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
And this is the team of Matsumoto, Itoi and Eguchi.

151
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Matsumoto is the first to be surprised.

152
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
It's a little cute.

153
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I just cried.

154
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
It's a little cute.

155
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
It's a big one.

156
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
It's a big one.

157
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
It's coming.

158
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
It's small though.

159
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
This year's fishing competition is going on at a high pace.

160
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
After this, Itoi Kato will fish the first fish.

161
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Only two of the eight members, Eguchi and Yoshi, have not yet caught anything in the first 20 minutes.

162
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I will fish this parent fish next time.

163
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Yoshi, turn off the camera.

164
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Is it not good?

165
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I heard you say, you came.

166
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
In a visual way.

167
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Why are you guys shooting the camera?

168
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Turn off the camera.

169
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
You just ate.

170
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I just ate.

171
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Are you talking to me?

172
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Is it my fault?

173
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Hamada is complaining about the fish, but Yoshi is getting more motivated.

174
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
And finally, the rod is dead.

175
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Finally!

176
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
It's a big one!

177
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
It's a big one!

178
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
It's a big one!

179
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
This is bad!

180
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
It's a big one!

181
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
This is a big one!

182
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I got it!

183
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Yoshi is happy to have caught the first fish.

184
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
And next to it, Hamada also caught a fish.

185
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
What's this?

186
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
It's not that big.

187
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
It's big.

188
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
It's exploding.

189
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Hawaii, are you watching?

190
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Sorry.

191
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
It's so small.

192
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
It's big.

193
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Yoshino's is big.

194
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
And it's a replacement.

195
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Yoshino's is big.

196
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
What's mine?

197
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
You said something big.

198
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
What's that?

199
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,000
The only one who hasn't caught anything yet is Eguchi.

200
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Eguchi, if you catch anything, you'll be in trouble!

201
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
What are you saying?

202
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Wait a minute.

203
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Eguchi is left alone and is in a hurry, but the lure is caught and he's in a state of shock.

204
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
This isn't the time to fish.

205
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
In the end, he is caught by Hamada again.

206
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Ah, you are in the middle of the road.

207
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
What?

208
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
You are close to downtown.

209
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Downtown?

210
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I don't know, you are an amateur.

211
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I thought it was a black bass, but it seems that he has caught a lure of Matsumoto.

212
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Mr. Hamagawa, I would like to ask you a question.

213
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Excuse me.

214
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Excuse me.

215
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I caught two fish, but the size is not good.

216
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I think I caught a roll.

217
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Please roll it up.

218
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I caught two fish, but the size is not good.

219
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I think Yoshi's fish is the biggest.

220
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I can't look at the camera.

221
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
It's okay, it's the African style.

222
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Oh, really?

223
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I'll do my best.

224
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Okay!

225
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Where did the sabiris come from?

226
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
And here again, Matsumoto gets hit.

227
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
It's here.

228
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Oh, it's big, it's big.

229
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Ready, set, go!

230
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Okay!

231
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Actually, he gets the 4th one.

232
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Isn't that amazing?

233
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
It's amazing.

234
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Something happened.

235
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
It's amazing.

236
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Matsumoto-san, you have a lot of them.

237
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I'm the one for today!

238
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
The TV station staff wants to say something

239
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Please, right now!

240
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Are you going to laugh at this?

241
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Go home!

242
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Is that okay?

243
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:42,000
The three of them are already an hour into the race.

244
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Downtown Lure Time!

245
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
You have won the prize!

246
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
This is the second time in a row!

247
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Do your best!

248
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:03,000
The person who uses the special Downtown Lure and gets the prize quickly gets 100,000 yen.

249
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Last year Eguchi won 100,000 yen.

250
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
This is a one-shot match where anyone can win.

251
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Who will win 100,000 yen this year?

252
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Here we go.

253
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Bouncing Ray time start!

254
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Eguchi hasn't won a single one yet.

255
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
He wants to take a look at his honor.

256
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
But...

257
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Here it comes!

258
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Kato suddenly hits the target.

259
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
If he can get it, he will get 100,000 yen.

260
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
It's coming!

261
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
No way!

262
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I grabbed the root of the plant.

263
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Sorry, sorry. It was exciting, right?

264
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
It was exciting, right?

265
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Yes, it was exciting.

266
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
You're watching it now, right?

267
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
It was exciting, it was exciting.

268
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Oh, it's coming!

269
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
This time, it's Yamasaki's turn.

270
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
It's coming, it's coming!

271
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
This time, it's going to be hot.

272
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
It's coming, it's coming!

273
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
It's coming!

274
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
It's a big one!

275
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
It's a big one!

276
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Amazing!

277
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
It's a victory at once!

278
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Hello!

279
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
What's going on?

280
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
You know what's going on, right?

281
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
That's not right.

282
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
You can't do that while fishing.

283
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
First of all, the fish will eat you and you can't do that.

284
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Definitely.

285
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Look!

286
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Hey!

287
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
That's enough.

288
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Look ahead!

289
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
And right after that, Matsumoto's rod is in trouble.

290
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
It's coming!

291
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
It's coming!

292
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
It's coming!

293
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
It's coming!

294
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
It's coming!

295
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,700
Downtown Lure Time, Matsumoto's Saw

296
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:51,700
It's here!

297
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:52,700
It's here!

298
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:53,700
What is it?

299
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:54,700
It's here!

300
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:55,700
It's here!

301
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:56,700
It's here!

302
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:57,700
It's here!

303
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:58,700
It's here!

304
00:13:58,700 --> 00:13:59,700
It's here!

305
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:00,700
It's here!

306
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:05,700
It's here!

307
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:08,700
Matsumoto-san, you've won 100,000 yen!

308
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,700
I did it!

309
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:12,700
That's amazing!

310
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:13,700
It's different from last time

311
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:14,700
It's here!

312
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:15,700
It's here!

313
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:16,700
It's here!

314
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:18,700
I was so embarrassed

315
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:24,700
The prize money of 100,000 yen was obtained by Matsumoto

316
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:26,700
The next round is the second half

317
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:29,700
The one who got the most points is Okuda

318
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:30,700
That's right

319
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:31,700
That was fast

320
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:32,700
That was fast

321
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,700
You acted well

322
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:35,700
Good, good

323
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,700
Yoshin-san, you took it off, right?

324
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:39,700
I didn't take it off yet

325
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:40,700
Good

326
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:41,700
You took it off

327
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:42,700
It's long

328
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:43,700
I'm taking it off

329
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,700
And Hamada continues

330
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:48,700
This boat is coming.

331
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,700
The bus is coming.

332
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:54,700
It's small.

333
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:59,700
I want a bigger one.

334
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:01,700
It's not bad.

335
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,700
It's good.

336
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:09,700
Hamada is fishing smoothly, but there is no luck with the big fish.

337
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:13,700
The last 30 minutes.

338
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:16,700
Tokunin Eguchi-san, do your best!

339
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:17,700
Hey!

340
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:18,700
He's a no-show.

341
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:20,700
I heard he's a zero.

342
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:21,700
You're only taking me?

343
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:22,700
Yes.

344
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:23,700
I see.

345
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:25,700
In 30 minutes.

346
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,700
Do your best!

347
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:29,700
This is bad.

348
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,700
So noisy.

349
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:41,700
Wow, so big!

350
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:45,700
Here again, the difference between Matsumoto and Zettou is huge.

351
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:47,700
It's huge.

352
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:51,700
This is huge.

353
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:53,700
This is huge.

354
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:54,700
It's huge.

355
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:57,700
Huge.

356
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:58,700
Huge!

357
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:01,700
It's a giant bus.

358
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:06,700
I'm nervous.

359
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,700
I'm nervous.

360
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:13,700
This is the perfect three.

361
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:16,700
Wow! It's huge!

362
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:19,700
What's with you today?

363
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:22,700
This is huge!

364
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:24,700
What is this?

365
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:26,700
It's huge!

366
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:31,700
Ego-chan, you're not supposed to be clapping!

367
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,700
I'm so happy.

368
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:38,700
The time is running out, but Kato is caught.

369
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,700
It's heavy.

370
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,700
It's heavy.

371
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,700
It's heavy.

372
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:46,700
This pace.

373
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:48,700
Got it.

374
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:50,700
Got it.

375
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:52,700
Got it.

376
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:57,700
Kato is happy as he caught a fish.

377
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,700
I did it.

378
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:01,700
Look! Look!

379
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,700
Look! What are you doing?

380
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:11,700
This is a bit...

381
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:13,700
See? I told you!

382
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,700
The participants who have won the big hit of Matsumoto and Kato...

383
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:21,700
...are looking for the next big hit and are putting on the last spurt.

384
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:24,700
This time, it's a win that hasn't happened in a year.

385
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:30,700
Who will win the trophy and be drunk by the taste of victory?

386
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:38,700
You're completely drunk!

387
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,700
This is a joke!

388
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,700
You're full of energy!

389
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:44,700
You're so cool!

390
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,700
I'm going to win the Eguchi!

391
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:52,700
I'm going to win the Eguchi!

392
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:55,700
Nothing!

393
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:58,700
Nothing!

394
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:00,700
I got it!

395
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:02,700
Carrot!

396
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:06,700
Carrot 4.5 points!

397
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:09,700
Carrot 4.5 points!

398
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:11,700
I got one!

399
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,700
Next is Hamada!

400
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:17,700
I know you want to eat the second one.

401
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,700
This is a little big.

402
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:23,700
It's 31cm.

403
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,700
Look at me.

404
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:33,700
You don't know, right?

405
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,700
It's about 8cm.

406
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,700
This is the biggest, right?

407
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,700
28cm.

408
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,700
I don't know.

409
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:45,700
Itoi-san, you're here.

410
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,700
Itoi-san, it's okay.

411
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:48,700
Oh, it's 30.

412
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:50,700
30.5...

413
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:52,700
No, it's 31.

414
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:53,700
It's 31.

415
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,700
31.

416
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:56,700
I see.

417
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:57,700
The winner is...

418
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:58,700
The winner is...

419
00:18:58,700 --> 00:18:59,700
The winner is...

420
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:00,700
Yes, Hamada Sankei.

421
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:01,700
Yes.

422
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,700
I have a good feeling about this.

423
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:04,700
First, Yoshii.

424
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:05,700
Yes, Yoshii.

425
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:06,700
30.

426
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:07,700
30.

427
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:08,700
It's 31.

428
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:09,700
31.

429
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:10,700
31.

430
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:11,700
Yes.

431
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:12,700
Next, Matsumoto.

432
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:13,700
Yes.

433
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:14,700
Mine is...

434
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:16,700
First, look at the numbers.

435
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:18,700
Wow!

436
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,700
It's huge!

437
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,700
This is huge!

438
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:24,700
Look! This is the first time I caught a big one!

439
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:26,700
Isn't it amazing?

440
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:28,700
This is huge!

441
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,700
This is amazing!

442
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:32,700
This is huge!

443
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,700
This is huge!

444
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:36,700
This is huge!

445
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:38,700
This is huge!

446
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,700
I did it! I really did it!

447
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,700
37!

448
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:44,700
37!

449
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:45,700
7!

450
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:46,700
7!

451
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:47,700
7!

452
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:48,700
Awesome!

453
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:50,700
This is...

454
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:51,700
Awesome!

455
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:52,700
Next, Haru!

456
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:53,700
Yes!

457
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:54,700
But this is big!

458
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:55,700
This is big!

459
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:56,700
This is long too!

460
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:57,700
Big!

461
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:58,700
This is big too!

462
00:19:58,700 --> 00:19:59,700
Oh!

463
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:00,700
Oh!

464
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:02,700
This is big!

465
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:03,700
This is big!

466
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:04,700
Oh!

467
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:05,700
My heart is pounding!

468
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:06,700
Go!

469
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:07,700
Go! Go! Go!

470
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:08,700
What's 37?

471
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:09,700
Ah, it's not!

472
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:10,700
It's not!

473
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:11,700
It's 35!

474
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:12,700
35!

475
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:13,700
35!

476
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:16,700
35! Kato-kun, 35!

477
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:21,700
Why did you come to see this with such interest?

478
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:33,700
Finally, the remaining one is the champion of last year!

479
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:36,700
But this is different.

480
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:38,700
Mine is long.

481
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,700
This is Matsumoto-chan!

482
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,700
30 points!

483
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:54,700
That means the winner is Matsumoto-chan!

484
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:03,700
I did it! I did it!

485
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:07,700
This year's results are as follows.

486
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:09,700
It's been 5 years since Matsumoto won the championship.

487
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:11,700
Eguchi's results are the worst.

488
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:17,700
This time, Matsumoto's 3-in-1 fish restaurant is the champion.

489
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:23,700
Furthermore, we will present 10 people with the speciality of Kaltura, downtown luer.

490
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,700
Please apply!

491
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:29,700
Today...

492
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,700
I was a carrot.

493
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:37,700
I really don't know what's going to happen next year.

494
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:44,700
I'll say it again, but I want to aim for the championship.

495
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:48,700
It doesn't matter if I'm third.

496
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,700
The one who was pitiful in the world was Yoshiko Ebuchi.

497
00:21:53,700 --> 00:22:01,700
I wonder why I can't catch any fish with that image.

498
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:07,700
If I were him, I would cry.

499
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:11,700
I don't think I've ever been in the top 10.

500
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:15,700
I don't think I've ever lost.

501
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:20,700
I want to do my best next year.

502
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:27,700
Today, I've been working in the clinic since 5am and I've been working for 12 hours.

503
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:33,700
I have to start work soon, but please call me again next year.

504
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:41,700
I was so excited until my throat was hoarse, but today, I was able to enjoy and relax in this nature.

505
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:50,700
I hope you can come to the event next year.

506
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:51,700
Thank you.

507
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:57,700
I think I'm a person who can be expected from now on.

508
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:00,700
Good luck!

509
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:07,700
Matsumoto from our team did well in today's boat competition.

510
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:09,700
I was able to win.

511
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:15,700
I want to be better than him next year.

512
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:18,700
I'll do my best next year.

513
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:21,700
I have something I've been hiding.

514
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:28,700
I've said a lot today, but I didn't wear a lure.

515
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:34,700
But it still comes.

516
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:39,700
But it's black.
