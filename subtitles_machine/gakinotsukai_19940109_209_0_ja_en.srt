1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Hello, this is the 7th time I've been here.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Are you a celebrity, So-chan, or Gramps?

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Now, let's welcome tonight's guests!

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Today's guests are...

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Let's introduce them!

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Nakagawami-san!

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Have you seen this segment before?

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Of course I have.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
If I had a TP, I wouldn't be here now.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
You're talking about Komaruya, aren't you?

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I'm sorry to say this, but I'm not Komashiro from San Pol.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Why?

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm the one who's been doing this for a while.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I know what's good and what's bad.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
It's a little unpleasant.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
It's a little unpleasant, isn't it?

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Last but not least, Matsumoto-san!

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I think so, too.

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Strangely, this segment has good ratings.

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I don't need good ratings.

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
You just said that!

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Let's get started.

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Are you a XXX-chan, or Gramps?

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Here it is!

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
You don't have any fans in Japan, do you?

27
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I've been doing this for a while, but you don't have any fans in Japan, do you?

28
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
That's a tough question.

29
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Tell me your gender.

30
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
All of them are women.

31
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Women?

32
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Then you don't have XXX-chan?

33
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
That's not a talent.

34
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Please write it down.

35
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
If I were a man, I'd be XXX-chan.

36
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
If you say that, I'll let you go.

37
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Please, please.

38
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Are you sure?

39
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I'm sorry, but I'll let you go for now.

40
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I'm sorry, but I'll let you go for now.

41
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Please write it down.

42
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Let's start with Mie-san.

43
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
You don't like it?

44
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
It's not that I don't like it.

45
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I'm just saying the current situation.

46
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
But...

47
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Okay, Otake-san.

48
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Do you know this person?

49
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Nakamura Azusa-san.

50
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
He's doing a commercial for Keirin, right?

51
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
That's right.

52
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
He's been in a lot of commercials.

53
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Who's recommending him?

54
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I'm in a commercial, too.

55
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Who's recommending him?

56
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I'm in a commercial, too.

57
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Who's recommending him?

58
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
He's not recommending anyone other than the toilet.

59
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
He's good.

60
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
You shouldn't say something like that.

61
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Okay, Matsumoto-san.

62
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Matsumoto-san is...

63
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I see.

64
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Sakai Noriko.

65
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Let's see the correct answer on the video.

66
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Who is it?

67
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Who is it?

68
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Who is it?

69
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I think it's Yamamoto Rinda-san.

70
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Matsuda Seiko-san.

71
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I think it's Rippy.

72
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I think it's Rippy.

73
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
If it's not Hong Kong, I don't think it'll work.

74
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Yamada Kuniko-san.

75
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Itsuo Mayumi.

76
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Sakunada Junko-san.

77
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Wata Akiho.

78
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Sakurada Junko.

79
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Matsuda Seiko.

80
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Kiyoka Nijiko.

81
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Sakai Noriko.

82
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Matsuda Seiko-san.

83
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Kobayashi Tachiko.

84
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I don't want you to wear that costume anymore.

85
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Yamamoto Rinda.

86
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Yamada Kuniko-san.

87
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Yamada Kuniko.

88
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Sakurada Junko.

89
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Sakurada Junko.

90
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Yamada Kuniko.

91
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Sakurada Junko.

92
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Yamada Kuniko.

93
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Sakurada Junko.

94
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Yamamori is Sakurada Junko-san.

95
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Yamamori is Sakurada Junko-san.

96
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Everyone, out!

97
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I haven't seen it recently, so I totally forgot.

98
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
It was fun, wasn't it?

99
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Even if I go to a dinner show, only people who are hungry come.

100
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Even if you're hungry, you have to pay.

101
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
How much is it?

102
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Next is this!

103
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Actually, you're the killer lemon of the entertainment world!

104
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
It's hard to write.

105
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
It's hard to write.

106
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,000
It's hard to write.

107
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Next, please.

108
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
This is a little scary.

109
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
This is a little scary.

110
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Mie-san, please show it.

111
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Here you go.

112
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
You have to go this far.

113
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
It's like Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah.

114
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
It's not my opinion.

115
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Ah, I see.

116
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
That's right.

117
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Next, Mako-chan.

118
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
What kind of joke is this?

119
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
There's no joke at all.

120
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
There's a story, isn't there?

121
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
There's a story, isn't there?

122
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
That's not it.

123
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
This guy!

124
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
You have to work a lot.

125
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
You have to say the reason.

126
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I don't have any reason, but on the Shinkansen,

127
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I came in, put on glasses,

128
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
and wore a flashy shirt.

129
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
When I got in, I looked around like this,

130
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
and there was a person, me and my eyes.

131
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I'm going.

132
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Without anything?

133
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Without anything.

134
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I'm going to say hello.

135
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
You should say that properly.

136
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
That's right.

137
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
That's right.

138
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Okay, Masato-san.

139
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Tamura Eriko?

140
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
This *** woman.

141
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I can't say hello to her.

142
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Really.

143
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Why?

144
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
It's annoying.

145
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Didn't you call her from behind?

146
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
No, I didn't.

147
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Harada is ***, so I didn't call her.

148
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Wow!

149
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Who is it? Who is it? Who is it?

150
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
No matter how I think about it, it's Otake-san.

151
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
He seems to have a bad personality.

152
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
He often says that he's bad.

153
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Ruu Oshiba-san.

154
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Oda Yuji?

155
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I think it's Nakao Mie.

156
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Naga Mariko.

157
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Naga Akiko-san.

158
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Izumi Pinko-san.

159
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Ruu Oshiba.

160
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I think it's downtown.

161
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Especially Hama-chan.

162
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Kamioka Ryutaro.

163
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Wada Akiko.

164
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Because he's a great drinker.

165
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Izumi Pinko-san.

166
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Taito Yuki-san.

167
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Otake Makoto-san.

168
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I think it's Otake-san.

169
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Wada Akiko.

170
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Izumi Pinko.

171
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Otake Makoto.

172
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Wada Akiko.

173
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Wada Akiko?

174
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Now, everyone except Wada Akiko-san is out.

175
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Oda-san is in second place.

176
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Second place?

177
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
No, Izumi Pinko-san is in third place.

178
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Izumi Pinko-san is in third place, right?

179
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Now, let's go.

180
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
You look dissatisfied.

181
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
You look dissatisfied.

182
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Next is this one.

183
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
You...

184
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
You're in an adult toy shop!

185
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
You don't know what you're doing.

186
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
If you don't come, you won't be able to sleep at night.

187
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Please sit here for a while.

188
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Please sit here for a while.

189
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I have something to do.

190
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Of course, it's a woman.

191
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I don't know how to guess.

192
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Now, let's start from Mie-san.

193
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
You're in a daily store, right?

194
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
You're in a daily store, right?

195
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Wada-san.

196
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
It's just that I don't look like it.

197
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
It's just that I don't look like it.

198
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Masumoto-san.

199
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Azachi Yumi.

200
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Azachi Yumi.

201
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Who is it? Who is it? Who is it?

202
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Kawashima Naomi.

203
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Ah, that's right.

204
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I think you'll like her.

205
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Okamoto Natsuki.

206
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Isn't that Matsuda Seiko-san?

207
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Kisamoto Masami.

208
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I'm in trouble at night.

209
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Okashiyama Ryoshu.

210
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Okamoto Natsuki.

211
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Kaku Chikako.

212
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Soyanagi Rumiko-san.

213
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
My husband is young, so I wonder if he's satisfied.

214
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Asano Yuko.

215
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Okamoto Natsuki.

216
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Koyanagi Rumiko.

217
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Wada Aki-ko.

218
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
My husband is young, so I wonder if he's satisfied.

219
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Kisamoto-san.

220
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Koyanagi Rumiko-san.

221
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Okamoto Natsuki.

222
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Kisamoto-san.

223
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Kisamoto.

224
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Kisamoto Masami.

225
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
So, the last one is Kisamoto Masami.

226
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
So, the last one is Kisamoto Masami.

227
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
So, the last one is Kisamoto Masami.

228
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I see.

229
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Natsuki is possible.

230
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
It's possible.

231
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I'm afraid of nodding.

232
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Are you sure?

233
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Ok, let's go to the next one.

234
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
The next one is this one.

235
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
You're just a chinchin enoki mushroom, chan!

236
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Do you have that?

237
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
You're just a chinchin enoki mushroom, chan!

238
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Wow, Mie-san, you're fast!

239
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Why are you so fast?

240
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I'm writing it as a memory of my trip home.

241
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I'll write it as a memory of my trip home.

242
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Welcome back, everyone.

243
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Welcome back, everyone.

244
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
It's hard.

245
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Ok, let's start with Mie-san.

246
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Mie-san.

247
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Dan!

248
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Oh, it's me!

249
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I'm really big.

250
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I'm not small.

251
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Really?

252
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I just get stiff when I'm excited.

253
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
What are you talking about?

254
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Okamoto-san.

255
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I'm Takeda, the melody.

256
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
But the character is different.

257
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
The character is different?

258
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I'm sorry.

259
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
It's ok.

260
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Ok, Matsumoto-san.

261
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I'm not used to it.

262
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
What's that?

263
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
No, no, no.

264
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
It's a step forward.

265
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
There's a beeper over there.

266
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Who is it? Who is it? Who is it?

267
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Matsumoto-san.

268
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Matsumoto-san from downtown.

269
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
He looks like he's about to get scared.

270
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
The sun-matchan.

271
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
The general Kazetai.

272
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
He's like a hero.

273
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
But he's lucky.

274
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Tamori-san.

275
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Sano-shiro-san.

276
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Kazama Toru.

277
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Sano-shiro.

278
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Tamori-san.

279
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Matsumoto-san.

280
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Sano-shiro-san.

281
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Giant Baba.

282
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Tamori-san.

283
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Sano-shiro-san.

284
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Tamori-san.

285
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Matsumoto-Hitoshi.

286
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Sano-shiro.

287
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Let's have fun!

288
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Let's have fun with the Grand Prix!

289
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Everyone out!

290
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
There were a lot of macho ones.

291
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
There were a lot.

292
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
How was it?

293
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
It was huge.

294
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
It was hard to breathe.

295
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
It was amazing.

296
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
It was like the hand of the Doraemon.

297
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:08,000
It felt good.

298
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
It's been a while.

299
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
That's right.

300
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
But this year, I've been a mess.

301
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
What do you mean?

302
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
From what to what, it's doubled.

303
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Wait a minute.

304
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I'm going to double everything.

305
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I'm going to double the dip as well.

306
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I'm going to make it crispy.

307
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Are you going to double the gyara?

308
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Of course I'm going to double the gyara.

309
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Not only that, but more than anything, it's double fun.

310
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
It's double fun.

311
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
It's double fun.

312
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
It's double fun.

313
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
If you did it once, you wouldn't be able to do that.

314
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
If you did it once, you wouldn't be able to do that.

315
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
If you did it twice, you wouldn't be able to do that.

316
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Don't say that.

317
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
You've been doing that since last year.

318
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I've been out all the time.

319
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
But you've been saving money.

320
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I've been saving twice as much.

321
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I see.

322
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
It's crazy.

323
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I drink a lot.

324
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I drink a lot and sometimes I can't stop.

325
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
It's an outlaw.

326
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I see.

327
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
But when it comes to love, it's crazy.

328
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Even if you're a kid, you say it was fun and go home.

329
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
But it's not like that.

330
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Please stop.

331
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
It's crazy.

332
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Let's look forward to it.

333
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Are you going to do something?

334
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Me?

335
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Are you going to do something?

336
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:58,000
What are you going to power up more than last year?

337
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I'm not going to power up.

338
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
What?

339
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:13,000
The other day, I was watching the police for 24 hours.

340
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
The difference between Osaka and Tokyo was huge.

341
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,000
The police and the people in the other town were fighting.

342
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
There are a lot of places like Tokyo.

343
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
There's Nagoya.

344
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Osaka was amazing.

345
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
The old lady and the police were fighting.

346
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
The old lady and the police were fighting.

347
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Stop it.

348
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
What are you talking about?

349
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I kicked this kid first.

350
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
The old lady said it.

351
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
The old lady said it.

352
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I kicked this kid first.

353
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I'll kill you.

354
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I'll kill you.

355
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Osaka is a mess.

356
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I kicked him when he took me to Osaka.

357
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I kicked him.

358
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I kicked him when he took me to Osaka.

359
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
A lot of people come to the police station.

360
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
This kid came to the police station.

361
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I kicked him.

362
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I kicked him.

363
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
You're a hidden camera.

364
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
You just walked in.

365
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
HON MAN.

366
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I like the timing of the police Verse.

367
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:45,000
And I'm the next.

368
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
and a bunch of other guys

369
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,500
When I came in

370
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:51,600
The police officer was writing on the counter

371
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,600
He was writing a document desperately

372
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,300
Excuse me

373
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:58,300
I don't have any money

374
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:00,300
I don't have any either

375
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,600
Can you lend me some money?

376
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,600
I said I don't have any

377
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,400
When I saw that in Osaka

378
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:15,400
There were a lot of weird guys and all the people walking were comedians

379
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:18,400
That's what they told me

380
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:21,900
So what did you say to that Osaka guy who's a foodie?

381
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:23,900
Why?

382
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:29,400
I didn't say I don't have any!

383
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,400
What's with you?

384
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,400
Why are you smiling?

385
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,400
Are you going to eat that?

386
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:39,400
But a long time ago

387
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:42,400
I did a video about you

388
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:45,400
I've been doing a lot of that stuff

389
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:48,400
I've been doing a lot of that stuff

390
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:51,400
Everyone's a fake

391
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:54,400
I'm a real fake

392
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,400
I'm not a fake

393
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:59,400
I'm my own original

394
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,400
Original, original, cheap

395
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:09,400
I sold it, I sold it, I sold it, I sold it, I sold it, I sold it, buy my own original

396
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:15,400
When I turn into me

397
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,400
What?

398
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,400
It's not good to say one thing

399
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,400
You should decide the punishment

400
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,400
I don't know at this point

401
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,400
That's right

402
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,400
I don't know at this point

403
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,400
What are we going to do?

404
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,400
What should we do?

405
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,400
Let's go with a strong one.

406
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,400
What do you mean by strong?

407
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,400
You know...

408
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,400
You have to do it with a 70-year-old old lady.

409
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,400
Urgh...

410
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,400
Urgh...

411
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,400
That's not how you do it.

412
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:52,400
I already know the other person's reaction.

413
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,400
It's tough.

414
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,400
That's no good.

415
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,400
There was a *** ***.

416
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:01,400
*** *** went to a love hotel with a girl.

417
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,400
The girl was like, no, no, no.

418
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,400
No, *** ***.

419
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,400
*** ***.

420
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,400
Where are you going, *** ***?

421
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,400
The girl ran away.

422
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,400
She went into the hotel to get some money.

423
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,400
What a waste.

424
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,400
She was sleeping in the hotel room.

425
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:29,400
The next day, the cleaning lady came.

426
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,400
The cleaning lady?

427
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,400
The cleaning lady came and said,

428
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,400
Oh, you're here. I'm sorry.

429
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,400
*** ***.

430
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,400
What the ***?

431
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,400
*** ***.

432
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,400
What are you talking about?

433
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,400
The cleaning lady ran away.

434
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,400
What a waste.

435
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,400
*** ***.

436
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,400
What a waste.

437
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,400
*** ***.

438
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,400
What's inside the calculator?

439
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,400
I don't know.

440
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,400
I don't know.

441
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,400
What's inside the calculator?

442
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,400
It's pretty thin, isn't it?

443
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,400
That's right.

444
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:10,400
I've cut it before.

445
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,400
You've cut it before?

446
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,400
Yes.

447
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,400
To check it out?

448
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,400
Yes.

449
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,400
What's inside?

450
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,400
Inside, there's a strawberry.

451
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,400
Why is there something like that?

452
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,400
*** ***.

453
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,400
That's enough.

454
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,400
Why are you eating it?

455
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,400
It's just a strawberry.

456
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,400
But it's a calculator.

457
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,400
To be clear,

458
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:45,400
I think it's more precise to put a big one in the whole electronic product.

459
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,400
I think it's amazing.

460
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,400
The contents are pretty small.

461
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:54,400
You think airplanes are amazing, don't you?

462
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,400
There are about three types of parts used for that.

463
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,400
*** ***.

464
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,400
*** ***.

465
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,400
There's no way there are three types.

466
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,400
If you open it, it's a simple structure.

467
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,400
An airplane.

468
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,400
Is that so?

469
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,400
Yes.

470
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,400
It's simple.

471
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,400
What do you call that driver's seat?

472
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,400
Yes.

473
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,400
A cockpit?

474
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,400
A cockpit.

475
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:16,400
You've seen it on TV, haven't you?

476
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,400
It's amazing.

477
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,400
There are only three types.

478
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,400
There are only three types.

479
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,400
That's the basics.

480
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,400
What do you mean by basics?

481
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,400
There are a lot of things.

482
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,400
There's a lever.

483
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,400
There's one here, too.

484
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,400
But you can't use it around here.

485
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,400
Lighting,

486
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,400
clock, etc.

487
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,400
That's the basics.

488
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,400
You can't just use a clock and lighting.

489
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,400
There are a lot of things.

490
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,400
There are only three types.

491
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,400
There are only three types.

492
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,400
You can't just use all of them.

493
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,400
I don't like dummies.

494
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,400
I only like the previous ones.

495
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,400
Then why do you have to use dummies?

496
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,400
Because they're cool.

497
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,400
I don't want to be looked down on.

498
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,400
Who?

499
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,400
Who are you looking down on?

500
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,400
The sky.

501
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,400
Don't be ridiculous.

502
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,400
Idiot!

503
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,400
Today,

504
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,400
the driver's seat is the last one.

505
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,400
This is for everyone.

506
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,400
Thank you for your hard work.

507
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,400
I came to Tokyo

508
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,400
to do something.

509
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,400
I was asked to join this program.

510
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,400
I was able to get to know a lot of people.

511
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,400
I wanted to do it until the end,

512
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,400
but I had something I wanted to do.

513
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,400
I ended up missing it on the way.

514
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:09,400
Thank you so much.

515
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:27,400
Thank you for the four years.

516
00:21:39,400 --> 00:22:07,400
Thank you for your hard work.

517
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:12,400
I'll invite you to the opening party.
