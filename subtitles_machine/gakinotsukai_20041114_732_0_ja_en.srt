1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The history of club activities with the kids

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The life-threatening

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
High speed spinning

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
And tonight

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Club activity part 3

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
The Kuchobashi Club starts

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
So Matsumoto-san

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Yes

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
The new club has been launched

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
That's right

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
It's the Kuchobashi Club

12
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Kuchobashi Club

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
This is what we call it, the Kuchobashi Club

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
For example

15
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
So, we're done with the end of the story.

16
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
What's going to happen next?

17
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
How long can we endure?

18
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
That's what I want to do.

19
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I thought about it last week, but I've been depressed since last night.

20
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I really hate this.

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
What is our name club?

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
This is the Baccarat.

23
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
You look strong.

24
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Thank you.

25
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
The opponent today is…

26
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Kusugurizurizu.

27
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
What?

28
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
This team is the leader of the Aroha.

29
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Go ahead!

30
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Oh, you're not telling us to laugh, but you're not making us laugh, right?

31
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
That's right, no matter what I do, the audience won't laugh.

32
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Hey!

33
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
It's a trap.

34
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,500
It's a trick.

35
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:28,500
Hey, it's Matsumoto Hama.

36
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:29,500
Hello.

37
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:32,500
Why don't you call me high tension anymore?

38
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,500
Oh, you're right.

39
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:35,500
You're right, now that you mention it.

40
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,500
Oh, I know why you don't call me high tension anymore.

41
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:38,500
What is it? What's wrong?

42
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:39,000
What?

43
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,500
A hot spring trip.

44
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Oh, that.

45
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,500
Well, if you say it like that, it's...

46
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:48,500
I can't do it, but I know you're a loser in the hot spring trip!

47
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,500
I betray women, but I don't betray men.

48
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:00,500
If I win today, I'll let each of you stay at my house.

49
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,500
No way!

50
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,500
Please.

51
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,500
Hey!

52
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,500
Hey, what's going on?

53
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:12,500
What?

54
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:18,500
You know, I can't take this kind of reaction anymore!

55
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:21,500
I want to laugh at it with my words!

56
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,500
His face is shining.

57
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,500
What?!

58
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,500
This kind of reaction...

59
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:30,500
Let's do it again.

60
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,500
Let's have the chairperson do it.

61
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:37,500
Thank you.

62
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:42,240
is that you notice that knock in the corner is old Japanese profiteering equipment?

63
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:47,440
banging in front of your boyfriend is not the ultimate.

64
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:52,280
The more you push your boyfriend the stronger the nail taking in the works.

65
00:02:53,900 --> 00:03:02,780
My industry in This district shows a lot of performance when you 당신er in the 36th, separ Soviet world cup games.

66
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:03,400
I see.

67
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,400
What do you call the person?

68
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,400
I call him Double.

69
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,400
Wait a minute, the season is off.

70
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,400
Is there a season off for comedians?

71
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,400
Yes, there is.

72
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,400
Do your best!

73
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,400
Do your best!

74
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,400
Congratulations!

75
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,400
Let me explain the rules.

76
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,400
The challenge is to have both teams compete with each other.

77
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:38,400
The team mates will be given a time limit until the time is up.

78
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,400
The team's total time will determine the winner.

79
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:46,400
The time limit will be announced after the challenge is over.

80
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:51,400
First up is Kusugurizuri's player, Fukawa Ryo.

81
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,400
What will be his reaction?

82
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,400
Ah, I'm tired.

83
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,400
I'm tired.

84
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:25,080
The parents of the mountains

85
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,080
Oh no!

86
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:29,080
It's not good!

87
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,080
Oh no!

88
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,080
It's not good!

89
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,080
No, no, no!

90
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,080
It's too much!

91
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,080
No!

92
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:41,080
Wait, Fuka, can't you do a stone-pushing move?

93
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,080
You keep saying no, but you can't do it.

94
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:47,080
The no and the happiness,

95
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,080
the happiness...

96
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,080
The happiness is the most important thing.

97
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:53,080
It's a bit of a burden.

98
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:56,080
But the voice is not coming out properly.

99
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,080
It's fine.

100
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,080
Then, for now, we'll talk about the usual things.

101
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,080
Yes.

102
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,080
Shouldn't we start with Endo?

103
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,080
That's right.

104
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,080
Are you okay?

105
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,080
Really, to a person called Eri-san,

106
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:12,080
Endo-kun really is a whole body life form.

107
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,080
A whole body life form.

108
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,080
Eri-san is a fool.

109
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,080
Like a romance novelist.

110
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:24,080
The battle with Kojoba Pharo is over.

111
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:21,040
How long will the body of the

112
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:28,080
Sensen Seikan team last?

113
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,080
I'll do my best.

114
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,080
I really can't move at all.

115
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,080
Please.

116
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,080
Ready!

117
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,080
Wait a minute.

118
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,080
Yes, yes.

119
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:40,080
Start!

120
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,080
It's no good.

121
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,080
It's no good.

122
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,080
It's no good.

123
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,080
It's no good.

124
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,080
It's no good.

125
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,080
I can do it.

126
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,060
Hamada is a very Wizard.

127
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:51,640
Hamada is a very Wizard.

128
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:59,520
Track him down.

129
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,760
It is not allowed if you show your venirison, and you guys want me to do that side...

130
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,760
I'm scared of your acting!

131
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:08,760
I can't stand it!

132
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:11,760
I'm scared of your acting!

133
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,760
I can't stand it!

134
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,760
I can't stand it!

135
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,760
You'll never be able to do it when I'm around!

136
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,760
Please stop it!

137
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:24,760
I'm scared of your acting!

138
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,760
Really?

139
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,760
Hey, this is not good!

140
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,760
You can still do it!

141
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,760
I can do it!

142
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,760
What's wrong with you?

143
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,760
But I'm practicing now.

144
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,760
Oh, really?

145
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,760
It's a bit of a burden.

146
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,760
I'm sorry, but that's really...

147
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,760
What's wrong?

148
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,760
I want to go over there and smile.

149
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,760
You're like that.

150
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,760
That's right.

151
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,760
What?

152
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,760
That's true.

153
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:57,760
The law of the Kusugurizuri is the law of the house.

154
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:47,840
Can you show us the

155
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,840
That's right.

156
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:49,840
What?

157
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:51,840
That's not true.

158
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,840
The law of the game is to be self-sufficient.

159
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,840
Can he show his true self in a poor life?

160
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:01,840
Ready...

161
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:03,840
Start!

162
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,840
I'm sorry.

163
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:13,840
You're sorry?

164
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,840
I'm scared!

165
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,840
Oh my god!

166
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,840
Oh my god!

167
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,840
He's shaking!

168
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,840
I'm scared!

169
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,840
I'm scared!

170
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,840
A 5-year-old?

171
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,840
Oh my god!

172
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,840
I'm scared!

173
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,840
Oh my god!

174
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,840
Help me!

175
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,840
Say it properly!

176
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,840
What's wrong?

177
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,840
Is this Yamaguchi?

178
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,840
Is this Yamaguchi?

179
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,840
Who is it?

180
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,840
Wow!

181
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,840
I didn't want to see you!

182
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,840
I see!

183
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,840
I saw you quite a lot!

184
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,840
I was born in the year of the rat.

185
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,840
You have a very good sense of smell.

186
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05,840
The one who is not a child is Yamasaki.

187
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:09,840
Can he withstand the mental strength of a middle-aged man and a child who is as good as a child?

188
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,840
Mr. Yamada, you look fine.

189
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,840
Yeah, I'm fine.

190
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:15,840
Alright, let's go!

191
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:16,840
Yes!

192
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:17,840
Good luck.

193
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,840
Ready...

194
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,840
Go!

195
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:22,840
Okay.

196
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,840
Nice touch.

197
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:27,840
He's trying his best.

198
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,840
He's trying his best.

199
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:29,840
He's trying his best.

200
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,840
He's trying his best.

201
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,840
This mountain, this mountain, this mountain, come here!

202
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:37,840
Good luck!

203
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,840
I'm sorry.

204
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,840
It's dangerous.

205
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,840
Open it.

206
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,840
It's dangerous.

207
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,840
I'm sorry.

208
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,840
It's dangerous.

209
00:08:51,840 --> 00:09:03,820
It looks like a

210
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:14,540
there should be a lane for it

211
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:17,400
B, re, d

212
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:23,220
There should be a lane for it

213
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:28,620
There should be a lane

214
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:30,620
I'm sorry!

215
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:37,620
This is bad.

216
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,620
I can't take this anymore.

217
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:43,620
I thought I was going to die.

218
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:45,620
You're surprisingly sticky.

219
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:50,620
No one is going to draw that.

220
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:53,620
I don't want to do this anymore!

221
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:55,620
That's why I told Takasu!

222
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:57,620
I'm a strong man, so I'll definitely do it!

223
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:59,620
You're really strong!

224
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:01,620
Really!

225
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:05,620
The second round of the Kusuguri series is the self-proclaimed chief, Inoue.

226
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:08,620
After being cornered to the extreme, he's the one to pay attention to.

227
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:09,620
Inoue.

228
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:10,620
Inoue.

229
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:13,620
Before you go, tell me what you call a tea bowl.

230
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:15,620
A tea bowl.

231
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:19,620
Yo!

232
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,620
Alright, start!

233
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:23,620
The answer is...

234
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:27,620
Oh, that's strong.

235
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:29,620
Oh, that's strong.

236
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:31,620
But it's different from usual.

237
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:33,620
I can't get it.

238
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:35,620
What do you call this thing?

239
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:39,620
Fu...Fu...Fuutarou.

240
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:43,620
It's strong.

241
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:45,620
That's a big idiot.

242
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:48,620
I'm listening to Beethoven.

243
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:59,620
Oh no, oh no, oh no.

244
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:01,620
This is bad.

245
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:07,620
Wow, amazing.

246
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:08,620
This is strong.

247
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:14,620
I don't think I have that much weight.

248
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:19,620
Tanaka is probably S.

249
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,620
I'm counting on you, Mr. Tanaka.

250
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:22,620
Please give me a good place.

251
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:23,620
Of course.

252
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:25,620
I think you have the ability.

253
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:28,620
Otherwise, I will go beyond the limits of my seniors and juniors.

254
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:33,620
The middle fielder is Tanaka.

255
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:36,620
He is short but has a S heart.

256
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:38,980
The Saya baby noises challenge the sky.

257
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:40,260
Do your best.

258
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,260
Ready...

259
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:43,900
Go!

260
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:51,180
You can not win!

261
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:53,340
That's enough

262
00:11:53,340 --> 00:12:18,100
I

263
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:26,480
are are are are are Chef Taro Hamada!?

264
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,480
Stop it! Stop it!

265
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,480
Stop it!

266
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,480
Stop it!

267
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,480
Stop it!

268
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,480
Stop it!

269
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,480
I get it!

270
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,480
It would be more fun if you do it like that!

271
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,480
He's saying that.

272
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,480
Really?

273
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,480
Well, well, well.

274
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,480
You were just rolling it out.

275
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,480
As expected?

276
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,480
It's okay.

277
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,480
Because,

278
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,480
He laughed more than Tanaka.

279
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,480
Stop it!

280
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,480
Stop it!

281
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,480
Really, stop it!

282
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,480
Stop it!

283
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,480
Stop it!

284
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,480
Stop it!

285
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,480
How pitiful.

286
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:14,480
I'm going to become a professor of psychology or something.

287
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,480
I'll be told like this.

288
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,480
Captain Kimura Yuichi is the vice-champion of the Kusugurizuri.

289
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:27,480
It looks strong to the eye, but...

290
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,480
This...this...this...

291
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,480
This magic tape is a little...

292
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,480
Let's go!

293
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,480
Ready...

294
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,480
Go!

295
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,480
Ouch! Ouch!

296
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,480
What?

297
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,480
What's wrong?

298
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,480
Stop it!

299
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,480
I'm sorry!

300
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,480
Which one is it?

301
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,480
You can do it!

302
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,480
Shima-san!

303
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,480
Shima-san, answer!

304
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,480
Answer!

305
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,480
Answer!

306
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,480
You can do it!

307
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,480
Say something!

308
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,480
Say something!

309
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,480
Eh?

310
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,480
You can do it!

311
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,480
Eh?

312
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,480
Which one is it?

313
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:23,480
Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no!

314
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,480
I'm done! I'm done! I'm done!

315
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,480
Wow, I've never seen this before.

316
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,480
You were talking in your voice.

317
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,480
I was acting like a girl.

318
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,480
Kojima Faro's nickname is the dress comedian Hamada.

319
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:51,480
What will happen if the person on the other side is defeated?

320
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:54,480
This is pretty scary.

321
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,480
What do you think?

322
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,480
It's not scary at all.

323
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:01,480
Eh, this is exciting.

324
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,480
It's exciting even for you.

325
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:06,480
It's a S.

326
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,480
That's the way M thinks.

327
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:12,480
Hama-san, ready, start!

328
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,480
I'm ready!

329
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,480
Oh, it's coming!

330
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,480
How is it?

331
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,480
It's good.

332
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,480
Good.

333
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,480
Good.

334
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,480
Your face is still good.

335
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,480
Is it okay?

336
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,480
Is it okay?

337
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,480
No!

338
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,480
No, this is not good.

339
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,480
This is not good.

340
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,480
This is not good.

341
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,480
You'll be kicked out.

342
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,480
aur to talk!

343
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,480
Let's go!

344
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,480
Take it easy!

345
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,480
I'm about to die!

346
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,480
Let's get him out of here!

347
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,480
I will do my best!

348
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,480
Omiya-san, do your best!

349
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,480
Do your best!

350
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,480
I will do my best!

351
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,480
I will do my best!

352
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,480
Hey! Hey! Hey!

353
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,480
Omiya-san, you did your best!

354
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,480
Nice fight!

355
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,480
Nice fight!

356
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,480
Amazing, isn't it?

357
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:38,480
You were a great teacher.

358
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,480
There was a time when I had a cramp.

359
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:44,480
You had a cramp in the spring and summer.

360
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,480
It ended in the summer.

361
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,480
It was like that at first.

362
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,480
What did you say at first?

363
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:54,480
When I cut a part, a switch comes in.

364
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,480
I think that switch is different for each person.

365
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,480
I knew it when I did it myself.

366
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,480
I don't think I can do it.

367
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,480
No, no, no.

368
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:08,480
The winner of the Kusugurizuri is Jodan's Mimata.

369
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,480
Let's see how he does after he's recovered.

370
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,480
What do you think of Mimata?

371
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,480
I think he's a bad guy.

372
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:21,480
I wish he was a cuter guy.

373
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:24,480
Mimata is a cutie!

374
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,480
He's a cutie!

375
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,480
I don't think he's a cutie.

376
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,480
It's not there.

377
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,480
Start!

378
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,480
This one.

379
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,480
It's like, go straight.

380
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,480
It's like, go straight.

381
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,480
Hey, can you change it with the camera?

382
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,480
It's not there.

383
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,480
What is this?

384
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,480
There's no pot yet.

385
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,480
Oh, I see.

386
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,480
What is this?

387
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,480
If I get a present, I'll be happy.

388
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,480
This is good.

389
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,480
This is...

390
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,480
Ah, here it comes.

391
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,480
This is a Nampo course!

392
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,480
Ah, Mr. Akiyama, this is no good.

393
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,480
What's not good?

394
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,480
This is no good.

395
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,480
You already knew?

396
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,480
No, it's...

397
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,480
We can still do it, right?

398
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,480
No, we can't do it.

399
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,480
We can do it, we can do it.

400
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,480
We can do it, we can do it.

401
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,480
Right?

402
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,480
No, no, no.

403
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,480
No, this is...

404
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,480
I'm done.

405
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,480
That's the same thing!

406
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,480
That's so dangerous!

407
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,480
I'm raising the bar!

408
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,480
I'm raising the bar!

409
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,480
I'm raising the bar!

410
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,480
I don't want to see it!

411
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,480
The feel is too different!

412
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,480
The feel is different!

413
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,480
I'm self-sufficient!

414
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:44,480
But Matsumoto-san, you have to do your best too!

415
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,480
That's right!

416
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,480
It was long!

417
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,480
Kojoba Parod's leader is Matsumoto!

418
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:52,480
Will he show the true power of the Do-Em-Gainer?

419
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,480
He challenges the last battle

420
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,480
I'm going to win!

421
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,480

I'm begging you

424
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,480

Does anybody wanna try?

436
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:18,060

00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:27,720
Was there anyone was there

452
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:28,680

Let's see the times of both teams!

461
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:42,460
First, the time of the first team.

462
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:44,460
The time of the second team is...

463
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:46,460
26 seconds!

464
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:48,460
That's pretty good.

465
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:50,460
Then, the first team.

466
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:51,460

I feel it.

476
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:14,980

482
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:33,060
4 seconds or more.

483
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:35,060
Wow, that's not good.

484
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:37,060
I'll go for 1 point.

485
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:39,060
Close it.

486
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:40,060

00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:54,060
Wow.

That means...

495
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:56,060
3 seconds.

496
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:57,060
20 seconds is not enough.

497
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:59,060
You have to win with 3 seconds or more.

498
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:00,060
I won by 1 point.

499
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:02,060

00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:04,060
I'll make it vertical.

00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:08,060

00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:09,060
1 point or 4 points.

503
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:11,060
If you win by 1 point, you win.

504
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:13,060
If you win by 1 point, you win.

506
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:28,060
I'm happy.

507
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:33,060
Well, I guess they didn't raise the flag for 1 minute and 43 seconds.

508
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:38,060
The 4th DVD is about to be released.

509
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:44,060
The last one to be released for 4 months is the cut-and-paste talk with the un-released scenes that couldn't be broadcast on TV.
