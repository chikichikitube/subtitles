1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Chikizuki's new year special episode

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Masato vs Amada 3 rounds

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I'm not going to lose

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
It's new year

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
The first round is flying box

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Amada vs Masato

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I'm going to let you two fly

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Are you ready?

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Let's do it

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
First, Hamada will fly this box

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I got it

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
It's about 5 rounds

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Next is Hitoshi Matsumoto's challenge

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Hitoshi Matsumoto's challenge

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Why did you blow up the box?

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
It's burning

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Why did you blow up the box?

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
What's going on?

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:28,000
You just blew up the box

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Why?

21
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,000
The neck too

22
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
It's okay if you get hurt

23
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Put your head down

24
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Are you okay?

25
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
What are we going to do?

26
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
If you blow up the box

27
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Why did you blow up the box?

28
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Is something wrong?

29
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
It's cold

30
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I've never blown up the box

31
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
What's that?

32
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
What's going on?

33
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Wait a minute

34
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I got it

35
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Should I think about it?

36
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I'm not feeling well

37
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
You don't have to blow up the box

38
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
My body hurts

39
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
It's burning

40
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
My stomach hurts

41
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
There's a lot left

42
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:03,000
This is like my adventure

43
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
What are we going to do?

44
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
There's no opening in the new year

45
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
But I think the same thing happened to the box

46
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
It's different

47
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I prepared a throw

48
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
You just have to throw it

49
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
You don't have to run

50
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Can you do it?

51
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Don't use that

52
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
It's not fashionable

53
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I'm worried about my parents

54
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Should we start from the head?

55
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
The hair is not connected

56
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Can you hide it with lighting?

57
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
We can edit it

58
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
The first special program

59
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Matsumoto vs Hamada

60
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I'm going to win

61
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
It's the new year

62
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I'm going to win

63
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I'm going to win

64
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I'm going to win

65
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I'm going to win

66
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I'm going to start from Hamada

67
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,000
It's going to fall

68
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I won

69
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
14m

70
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Thank you

71
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I can't lose

72
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Hitoshi Matsumoto is going to start

73
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Hitoshi Matsumoto's hammer throw

74
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Start

75
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Smoke is coming out

76
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,000
It's coming out

77
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
It's coming out

78
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
It's scary

79
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Again?

80
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
It's a big fish

81
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
You should have told me

82
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
You should have told me

83
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
It's fine

84
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
It's fine

85
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Why is it exploding?

86
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,000
We can't pay for the fish

87
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
It's only for Hamada

88
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
He's in the hospital

89
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
He's going to Yoshimoto

90
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
You should have told me

91
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I'm going to fight

92
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
It's not like that

93
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I'm going to the hospital

94
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Sorry

95
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
It tastes bad

96
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Are you okay?

97
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I don't know

98
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Why is it exploding?

99
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I can't stand it

100
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Why are you laughing?

101
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I'm not laughing

102
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I'm scared

103
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I can't recommend it

104
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
What should I do?

105
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I can't use this

106
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
How about water?

107
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
How many times can you do it?

108
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Is that okay?

109
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
It's okay

110
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
You should have told me

111
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,000
You should have told me

112
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Why are you wearing the other side?

113
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,000
What are you doing?

114
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:49,000
You can't talk with that head

115
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,000
It's only 30 seconds

116
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Let's take a picture

117
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
The hair doesn't fit

118
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,000
It's useless

119
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Are you worried about your hair?

120
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Don't kick it

121
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Cut it

122
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Let's do it

123
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I can't do it

124
00:08:52,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Ladies and gentlemen

125
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Please change your mind

126
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
This year

127
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
It's the first time

128
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I'm getting older

129
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I went somewhere

130
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Where?

131
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Vancouver

132
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
It was hard

133
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
What do you mean?

134
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I was surprised

135
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I was watching it at home

136
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I didn't expect it

137
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I didn't imagine it

138
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I didn't imagine it

139
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I didn't imagine it

140
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
It was different

141
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
It was different

142
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I was surprised

143
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Really?

144
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I was surprised

145
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I thought you were going to cut the wire

146
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
It was like this

147
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Why didn't you cut it?

148
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I was surprised

149
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
What did you wear?

150
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
It was amazing

151
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,000
You looked like you were growing up

152
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I was surprised

153
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
It was hard

154
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I went to Hong Kong for the end of the year

155
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
It was good

156
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
But I woke up

157
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I was really scared

158
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I was sleeping like I was going to die

159
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
You were tired

160
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I was really tired

161
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
There was a bed

162
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I was sleeping like this

163
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I went in

164
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I was lying down

165
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I was sleeping like this

166
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I told him to lie down

167
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I was sleeping like this

168
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I was sleeping like this

169
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I looked at him

170
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I didn't know he was Jimmy

171
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I thought he was a crazy guy from Hong Kong

172
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I was surprised

173
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I looked at him

174
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
What?

175
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Everyone was looking at me

176
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
The staff

177
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
The staff was looking at me

178
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I didn't know

179
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
What?

180
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I didn't know what was going on

181
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
There were many people looking at me

182
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I was really scared

183
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
You too

184
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I was really scared

185
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I didn't know what was going on

186
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
But I still didn't understand

187
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I was surprised

188
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I looked at him

189
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I was surprised

190
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
My body

191
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I was surprised

192
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I didn't know what was going on

193
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Why are you sleeping like this?

194
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
What?

195
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
He's an old man

196
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
He's just an old man

197
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Why are you sleeping like this?

198
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,000
What is this?

199
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
This is really funny

200
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:09,000
After breakfast, everyone went out

201
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I didn't know what was going on

202
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I still didn't understand

203
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I felt like I was being bullied

204
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I felt like I was being made a fool

205
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Everyone was surrounding you

206
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I felt like I was being rude

207
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I was really upset

208
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Why?

209
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I felt like I was being really treated well

210
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I wanted to throw up

211
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
You can throw up

212
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I wanted to throw up

213
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
It felt so refreshing

214
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
You're lying

215
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Don't do that

216
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
It was like he went down refreshingly.

217
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Stop it.

218
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I don't want to wake up.

219
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Well, this year too,

220
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
the musical instrument will continue like this.

221
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
That's right.

222
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Ah, that's right.

223
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I still don't know what happened to Kouhaku.

224
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
If Hamada loses, the punishment for this year won't be funny.

225
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
That's right.

226
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
It's a nose-shaped punishment.

227
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Eh, wait a minute.

228
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Eh, are you peeling off the skin?

229
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
It's a skin.

230
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
The nose?

231
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Yes, the nose.

232
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Right?

233
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
That's no good.

234
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Yes, yes.

235
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
That's why I'm going to cut this part.

236
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
It's going to be a crooked red tail.

237
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
That's good though.

238
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
What should I do?

239
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I see.

240
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
It's going to be a big deal.

241
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Are you going to write a letter?

242
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Yes, I'm going to.

243
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
That's good.

244
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
That's good.

245
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
That's good.

246
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
The other day,

247
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
when I was in the car,

248
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
there was a guy who forced himself into a narrow alley.

249
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
There's a lot of people.

250
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I don't know why he was in such a hurry,

251
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
but I thought he was going to come out like this,

252
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
so he came out like this.

253
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
If he had waited for me here,

254
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I wouldn't have been able to get out like this.

255
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Because it's narrow.

256
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Yes, yes, yes.

257
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
He's coming.

258
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
He's really coming.

259
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
It's like this.

260
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I can't help it.

261
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Really?

262
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Yes.

263
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I can't help it.

264
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I was just about to fall.

265
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
The driver's seat and I were here, right?

266
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
This is the driver's seat, right?

267
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Yes.

268
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I've been holding out so far,

269
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
but I'm getting more and more angry.

270
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
When the last body came here,

271
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I stopped it.

272
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Open it like this.

273
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Open it.

274
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
The body.

275
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:52,000
The body.

276
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I went out.

277
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
It's a narrow alleyway.

278
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
He said he was going to make a U-turn and come right away.

279
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Oh, I see.

280
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
You didn't know your face,

281
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
so you just made a U-turn.

282
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Touch it, touch it.

283
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
What is it?

284
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
It's a car.

285
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Really.

286
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I've said it many times.

287
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I've said it many times.

288
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Shinjuku.

289
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
In front of Lumine.

290
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
The road is wide, isn't it?

291
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Yes, yes, yes.

292
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I'm going to the tunnel over there.

293
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Yes, I'm going.

294
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
At that time, everyone tried to turn to Shinjuku.

295
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Isetan, Hokon.

296
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Yes, yes, yes.

297
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
At that time, most of them turned left.

298
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Yes, yes, yes.

299
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
But everyone stopped turning left.

300
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
What do you mean, everyone turned left?

301
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,000
It's a reverse triangle in front of Lumine.

302
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I want to go right away.

303
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I want to go right away.

304
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Come a little closer and go in.

305
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
What is it?

306
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Is it like that every time?

307
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
It's like that every time.

308
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I can't go straight at all.

309
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Then you should turn too.

310
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Why am I going to Isetan's pet shop?

311
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Why is it a pet shop?

312
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I went to Isetan's pet shop.

313
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I don't know.

314
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I don't know.

315
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Then you should go.

316
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Stop it.

317
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,000
If it's like that every time, you should change the road.

318
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I can only use this on Sunday.

319
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Because it's all that.

320
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Because it's a pet shop.

321
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Because it's a pet shop.

322
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
That's right.

323
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Let's go.

324
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
By the way.

325
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Let me tell you the best comic book.

326
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Stop the pet shop.

327
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
What is it?

328
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Who would be happy with that?

329
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Who would be happy with that?

330
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I was walking while eating cup noodles.

331
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
In the 1950s.

332
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
From Shinjuku.

333
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
From Harajuku.

334
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
What is it?

335
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Right?

336
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I did everything.

337
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I don't know.

338
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Who is that?

339
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
What?

340
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Pet shop?

341
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Who is the pet shop?

342
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Right?

343
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I have to go to the TV show on Sunday.

344
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
You don't say I.

345
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
You don't say I.

346
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
You don't say I.

347
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:24,000
A year ago, you predicted the lack of glasses.

348
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
How was the result?

349
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
What will happen this year?

350
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:35,000
If you predict like that, the whole country will panic.

351
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,000
But you said the lack of glasses last year.

352
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:44,000
What will happen this year?

353
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:55,000
At the end of January, there will be a drop hole boom.

354
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Boom?

355
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I want to tell you one thing.

356
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
When you are walking on the street,

357
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,000
like pineapple,

358
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:15,000
or when you see a banana, don't get close to it.

359
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Don't get close to the leaves.

360
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Don't get close to the leaves.

361
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I know.

362
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
It's unnatural.

363
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I can't help it if you say it in January.

364
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I have to tell you one thing.

365
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I got it.

366
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
A bus gas explosion.

367
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:48,000
That's not it.

368
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
That's not it.

369
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,000
A new beast.

370
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:00,000
It is said to be the biggest enemy for humans.

371
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
A wild dog.

372
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,000
If you leave it alone, it will die on its own.

373
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
You don't have to deal with it.

374
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
At first, it's scary.

375
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
It will bite you.

376
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
But it will die on its own.

377
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,000
And it will bite you.

378
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
That's scary.

379
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
If it bites you, it's scary.

380
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
It's scary.

381
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
That's scary.

382
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:34,000
It's like a disaster.

383
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
You know that, right?

384
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Yes, I know.

385
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
On the Earth,

386
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:44,000
there is a huge planet.

387
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:50,000
It's a huge planet.

388
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:55,000
It will bite you.

389
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,000
What kind of planet is on the Earth?

390
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Hey!

391
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Hey!

392
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
It's much bigger than the Earth.

393
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
It will bite you.

394
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
It will bite you.

395
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
It will bite you.

396
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
It's scary.

397
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
It's scary.

398
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
It's scary.

399
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
And it will bite you.

400
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
And it will bite you.

401
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
What?

402
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
What's that?

403
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
And it will rub you.

404
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
It will rub you.

405
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,500
It's a planet, isn't it?

406
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,000
Shut up.

407
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
The trip to Australia on the Earth,

408
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
어요

409
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
This is interesting.

410
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Mr. Matsumoto was kidnapped by an alien

411
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,160
because he found out the secret of NASA.

412
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,000
Please tell me about that incident.

413
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,000
I was surprised. I was driving by myself.

414
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
I don't know how to say it.

415
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:54,000
I don't know how to say it.

416
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Light!

417
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Simply put, it's a disc.

418
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
You can't say it's a disc!

419
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
I don't know how to say it!

420
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
You said it's light!

421
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
It's a disc type.

422
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
It's a disc type.

423
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
What type?

424
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
There's a lot.

425
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
There's a lot.

426
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
There's a lot.

427
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
But it's a disc type.

428
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
It's a disc type.

429
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
No!

430
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,000
It comes out like this.

431
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
There's a reason for it.

432
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
There's a reason for it.

433
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,000
It's like a movie.

434
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
I don't think there's a reason for it.

435
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
I don't think there's a reason for it.

436
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
It comes out like this.

437
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,000
An old man was sucked up.

438
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Did you see the bottom?

439
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,000
An old man came out again.

440
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
It seems to have been a mistake.

441
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I raised it once and said it was wrong.

442
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
I raised it once and said it was wrong.

443
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
It's a mistake with me.

444
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
It's a mistake with me.

445
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
I was sucked up.

446
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
What is it?

447
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:14,000
It's a one-room.

448
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
It's not that big.

449
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,000
The floor is floor.

450
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
How many people were there?

451
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
How many people were there?

452
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
How many people were there?

453
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
47 or 48?

454
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
It's a one-room.

455
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
It's a one-room.

456
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
It's a one-room.

457
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Don't raise it.

458
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Don't raise it.

459
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Raise it when you can afford it.

460
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Raise it when you can afford it.

461
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
I was surprised.

462
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
An old man came out.

463
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
An old man came out.

464
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Wait a minute.

465
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Wait a minute.

466
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Open it.

467
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
I met him.

468
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
I was told not to say it.

469
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
I was told not to say it.

470
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
I suddenly got into it.

471
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Don't say it.

472
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
I'm scared.

473
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
I was told not to say it.

474
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
I was told not to say it.

475
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
How many people were there in the one-room?

476
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
How many people were there in the one-room?

477
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
I can't say it.

478
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:32,000
