1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
This way, please.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
All of a sudden?

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I'm sorry.

4
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Please explain the situation.

5
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Today, the two of you are always working hard.

6
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
We're working hard.

7
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
In the sense that we're trying to get rid of the loan...

8
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Sorry.

9
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
In the sense that we're trying to get rid of the loan...

10
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I want to be in the middle.

11
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
In the sense that we're trying to get rid of the loan...

12
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Sorry.

13
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
We've already prepared the inn.

14
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Really?

15
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Yes.

16
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Please have fun today.

17
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
No, not this way.

18
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
This way.

19
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Oh, this way.

20
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Can you take me there?

21
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
What? You're going to pick me up?

22
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
You're going to pick me up?

23
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Yes.

24
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Mr. Wataru is here.

25
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
This is amazing.

26
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
This is nice.

27
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Yes.

28
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Isn't it nice?

29
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
We've prepared all the food in Edo.

30
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
All the food in Edo?

31
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Yes, we've prepared all the food in front of Edo.

32
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Thank you very much.

33
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Please have a drink.

34
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
How did you do today?

35
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Not bad.

36
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
This is nice.

37
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
We'll be moving soon.

38
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Is that so?

39
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
This is the first time we've been on a boat like this.

40
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Isn't it?

41
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm sure it is.

42
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
But, we're not getting any laughter.

43
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
It's not funny when we're talking.

44
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Yes, you're right.

45
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
We're not funny.

46
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
It's fine.

47
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Please wait a little.

48
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Please take a look.

49
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
It's very beautiful.

50
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Take it off.

51
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
This program is brought to you by the following sponsors.

52
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
If you're doing something like Taiko Moji, you don't have any talent.

53
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Do you want to do it?

54
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Please do it.

55
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
This is Entakinawa.

56
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Please watch my performance.

57
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Yama-chan!

58
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Gag!

59
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Yes, I'm on a yacht in the world.

60
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
It's so cold.

61
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
We've arrived at the point.

62
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Here?

63
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Yes.

64
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
This is Entakinawa.

65
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
This way.

66
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
What?

67
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
This way.

68
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Why are you hiding your face?

69
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I'm not hiding my face.

70
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Are you serious?

71
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Yes, I'm serious.

72
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Oh, I see.

73
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Can I go?

74
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Yes, you can.

75
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I'm looking forward to it.

76
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Can I say anything?

77
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Anything is fine.

78
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Girls!

79
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I love you!

80
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Excuse me.

81
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I'm going to practice with this on.

82
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Why are you all bending your back?

83
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
What is that old lady with glasses?

84
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
She looks like an educator.

85
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Is she an educator?

86
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Oh, I see.

87
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
She's an old lady.

88
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I'm Aoi.

89
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I still like you.

90
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
What's your name?

91
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I'm Aoi.

92
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I'm Satsuki.

93
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I'm Satsuki.

94
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I'm Yayoi.

95
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I'm Misetsu.

96
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I'm Misetsu.

97
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I'm Koume.

98
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I'm Okamoto.

99
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I'm Okamoto.

100
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I'm Mameyako.

101
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I'm Mameyako.

102
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I'm Mameyako.

103
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Forget about Mameyako.

104
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Some of the baseball members like her are very good at baseball.

105
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:40,000
You don't need to say that...

106
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I see.

107
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
You're so good at this!

108
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Is it fun?

109
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
This person is...

110
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Aoi-san

111
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Aoi-san

112
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Aoi-san, don't be shy

113
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
It's your first time but do you want to try?

114
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
It's your first time but do you want to try?

115
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:30,000
It's your first time but do you want to try?

116
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I don't know

117
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
That's all

118
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
That's all

119
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Thank you

120
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:45,000
What?

121
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
That's all

122
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Thank you

123
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I got carried away

124
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
That's all

125
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
That's all

126
00:05:53,000 --> 00:06:00,000
From now on, we will see the performance of Mameyakko-san who has been doing this for a long time

127
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
What? This old lady has been doing this for a long time

128
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
What? This old lady has been doing this for a long time

129
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Mameyakko-san has been doing this for a long time

130
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,000
This guy, wait a minute

131
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Hit him

132
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Please wait

133
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Please wait

134
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I'm sorry

135
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Seriously

136
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Seriously

137
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Scary

138
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Huh?

139
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I'm Daigyu Suga!

140
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Daigyu Suga!

141
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
You're so ugly!

142
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
You're so scary!

143
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
So scary!

144
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Daigyu Suga!

145
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
You're so ugly!

146
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Hey!

147
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
What's up?

148
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
What's up?

149
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
You're so annoying.

150
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
You're so annoying.

151
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
You're so annoying.

152
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
By the way, you guys...

153
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Yes?

154
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I've been watching you guys for a while.

155
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
You're so disgusting!

156
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
He's angry.

157
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
You can't even do the Shachi-hoko.

158
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I'll show you the real Shachi-hoko.

159
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
This is good.

160
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I'll show you the real Shachi-hoko.

161
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
That's good.

162
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
That's good.

163
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
You have to show us.

164
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
You've come this far.

165
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
You have to show us that you're different from these people.

166
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Daigyu Suga.

167
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
The one and only Shachi-hoko.

168
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
You're so disgusting!

169
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Look!

170
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
You're so disgusting!

171
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
You're so disgusting!

172
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
What are you doing?

173
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Shachi-hoko

174
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Brother!

175
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
You're the best!

176
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Brother!

177
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Why are you so loud?

178
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
The best Shachi-hoko, Daigyu Suga!

179
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Why are you looking at me like that?

180
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Daigyu Suga!

181
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
You're disgusting!

182
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
That's enough.

183
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Daigyu Suga

184
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,000
We don't have much time today.

185
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,000
We have time, but you don't have to go home.

186
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
We're pushing the time.

187
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
When the time comes, you can go home.

188
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I'll talk to you on the bike.

189
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
It's not like that.

190
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
What are you talking about?

191
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
What should we do?

192
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
We're doing this show once a week, right?

193
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
There's no such thing as an interesting happening in a week.

194
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
There's no such thing.

195
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
There's a lot of small things.

196
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
The other day, the day before yesterday,

197
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
there was a crow in the house.

198
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
There was a crow.

199
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
There was a crow.

200
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
When I hit the crow,

201
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
the machine couldn't catch it.

202
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
When I looked at it, it only had a crow's face.

203
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
It was cute.

204
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I thought there was a crow somewhere.

205
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
It had a bulging butt.

206
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
When I touched it with a tissue,

207
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
it had a different face.

208
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
It was sitting like this.

209
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
What's so interesting about this story?

210
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
It's not interesting, is it?

211
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
But that's how it is in a week.

212
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
It's not like that, is it?

213
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
It's not like that.

214
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
If you put on a lot of color, it's even worse.

215
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
It's even worse.

216
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
It's like you're trying to make people laugh.

217
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I don't like that.

218
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I'm cold myself.

219
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
So I say what I want to say.

220
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
That's how it is.

221
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
That's how it is.

222
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Thank you very much.

223
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I'm going to the commercial.

224
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
That's fast.

225
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Do you know how hard this is?

226
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
We've been doing this for six years.

227
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Don't cry.

228
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Say something.

229
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Something has changed.

230
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
That's what I was looking for.

231
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
There's a lot of change.

232
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
That's why.

233
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
We've only done 17 episodes.

234
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
We're all the same.

235
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
That's right.

236
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
You should go out to a lot of places.

237
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
You should be in a fashionable relationship.

238
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Are you fashionable?

239
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I'm not like this.

240
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I'm just like this.

241
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Don't say that.

242
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
If you're doing it with the same people, you should copy me.

243
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
You're the same.

244
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
But...

245
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
But what?

246
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
There aren't a lot of people who want to go out.

247
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
You have a lot of experience.

248
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I want to go out a lot.

249
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I want to go out to a lot of businesses.

250
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Do you want to go out?

251
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
What?

252
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Do you want to go out to a lot of businesses?

253
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
No, I don't want to go out.

254
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Do you want to go out?

255
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
No.

256
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:20,000
What are you doing?

257
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Just a little bit.

258
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Why?

259
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Are you stupid?

260
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
No, really.

261
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
You should go out.

262
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
No, I don't want to go out.

263
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
You should go out with me.

264
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
What do you want to go out?

265
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
What do you want to go out?

266
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I want to get a lot of prizes.

267
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Why?

268
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I don't want to go out.

269
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I want to go out to a lot of places.

270
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I want to go out to a lot of places.

271
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I want to go out to a lot of places.

272
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Why?

273
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I want to get a lot of prizes.

274
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
But...

275
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I want to go out to a lot of places.

276
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,000
If you go on a trip, I won't have the right to go out.

277
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:07,000
But if you go on a trip, I won't have the right to go out.

278
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Is that so?

279
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Why are you not commenting?

280
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I don't want to talk.

281
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Do it on TV!

282
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I don't want to talk.

283
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I wasn't interested in it.

284
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
You weren't interested in it?

285
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Even this?

286
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I don't want to talk.

287
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I see.

288
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
You're going to be in a drama again, right?

289
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I'm sorry.

290
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I'm really sorry.

291
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
You're going to take all the young women in Japan...

292
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
What are you talking about?

293
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
That's why I'm talking about this guy.

294
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I want to tell you guys.

295
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Don't compare the drama with reality.

296
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
It's completely different, isn't it?

297
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
That's true.

298
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
For example, if you're weak...

299
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
For example, if you're weak...

300
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
For example, if you're weak...

301
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
If you're weak, you should open a sleeping class.

302
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,000
What are you talking about?

303
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I'm not interested in it.

304
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
You're interested in it?

305
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
You're interested in it?

306
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I'm not interested in it.

307
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I'm not interested in it.

308
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
It's wonderful.

309
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Actors are interested in reality and drama.

310
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
They think I'm like this.

311
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I'm like this.

312
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
It's totally different.

313
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Normally, I'm like this.

314
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I'm not interested in it.

315
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I'm not interested in it.

316
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I'm not interested in it.

317
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I'm not interested in it.

318
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I'm thinking about the short story.

319
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
The apple is the best product in Japan.

320
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,000
The apple is the best product in Japan.

321
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
This is...

322
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Why do you think it's the best product?

323
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
You may think so now.

324
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
My story is always like that.

325
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
At first, I think it's strange, but in the end...

326
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
It's strange all the time.

327
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
In the end, everyone is convinced.

328
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I'm not convinced.

329
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I'm satisfied with Ayahuya.

330
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Don't say Ayahuya.

331
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
What?

332
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Speaking of the best product in Aomori Prefecture...

333
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Don't say what?

334
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
That's my job.

335
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Speaking of the best product in Aomori Prefecture...

336
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Speaking of the best product in Aomori Prefecture...

337
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
It's the apple.

338
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
It's the same.

339
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,000
The best product in Aomori Prefecture is not only in Aomori Prefecture.

340
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Do you understand?

341
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,000
That's why I'm familiar with the Japanese products.

342
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

343
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I'm familiar with the Japanese products.

344
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I'm familiar with the best products.

345
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
You can say that.

346
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
You're familiar with the best products.

347
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I'm familiar with them.

348
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Are you sad?

349
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I'm not sad.

350
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I'm familiar with them.

351
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I'm sleepy right now.

352
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Why?

353
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Speak.

354
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Why are you sleepy?

355
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I'm sleepy.

356
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:42,000
The apple is coming out in Japan right now.

357
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:50,000
About 45% of this product is from Aomori Prefecture.

358
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:57,000
And the remaining 55% is from me.

359
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I don't understand the meaning of the word, me.

360
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I'm the one who created it.

361
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
How do you do it?

362
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Well...

363
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,000
About once a month...

364
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Sometimes I do this.

365
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I lie down.

366
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
It's tiring, isn't it?

367
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I do this.

368
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
How do you do it?

369
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I do this.

370
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Then the person who made it will come.

371
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
The person who made it will come?

372
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,000
The person who made it will come.

373
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
The person who made it will come.

374
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I'll lie down.

375
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,000
And the person who made it will do it.

376
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,000
The person who made it will do it.

377
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Do you cut your nipples?

378
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I don't cut my nipples.

379
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Who cuts their nipples?

380
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Gyo-cha does.

381
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:02,000
If you don't, your nipples will fall off.

382
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Right?

383
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Rinkan is also completely white.

384
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Ah, it's not Rinkan.

385
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
What is it?

386
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Eh?

387
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
It's Newton. Who is it?

388
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
It's me, isn't it?

389
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Can you say it?

390
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Yes, yes.

391
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Newton.

392
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Ah, that's how it is.

393
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Mike Tyson's left arm has a tattoo of respect for Moutakuto.

394
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
What kind of tattoo is there on Mach-chan's left arm?

395
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
My tattoo is a bit different from normal people's.

396
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Ah, is that so?

397
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Well, I don't know how to say it.

398
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I remember a lot of anger.

399
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Does it come out when you're angry?

400
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:56,000
When I'm angry, it's like...

401
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I think it doesn't smell.

402
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,000
What?

403
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
What kind of tattoo comes out?

404
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
What?

405
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
What kind of tattoo comes out?

406
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Mike Tyson's Moutakuto.

407
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Yes, yes, yes.

408
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
What kind of tattoo comes out?

409
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Ah, it comes out in various ways.

410
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Why does it come out in various ways?

411
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:19,000
There are various things that come out of nowhere.

412
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Are you really angry?

413
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Really?

414
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
What?

415
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
What comes out?

416
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Well, this is...

417
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
What?

418
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
What?

419
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:47,000
What kind of tattoo comes out?

420
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Why don't you tell me?

421
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
What?

422
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:57,000
What kind of tattoo comes out?

423
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
What kind of tattoo comes out?

424
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Well, let me tell you.

425
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,000
It's usually a tattoo of a girl I'm dating.

426
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Ah, yes.

427
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Yoshiko Inoshita.

428
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Ah, Yoshiko Inoshita.

429
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
That's good.

430
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
And Keiko Inoshita.

431
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Ah, Keiko Inoshita.

432
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
That's good.

433
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Well, that's a life.

434
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
That's a life.

435
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
It's troublesome when you break up.

436
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
That's right.

437
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
You can use a stone.

438
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
You can use a stone.

439
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
You can use a cicada.

440
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Please do something.

441
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Mr. Matsumoto, an animal scientist who's in the top five in the world.

442
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Why can a crane support its body with such thin legs?

443
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I also...

444
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
So you're an animal scientist?

445
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
That's right

446
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
So you're in the field of expertise?

447
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Of course, it's a very specialized field

448
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:49,000
I'm mostly researching the legs of cranes

449
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Specialized in what?

450
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
I'll be honest with you

451
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Of course!

452
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
I don't care if you call me a thief

453
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Of all the living animals in the world

454
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
The one with the best balance is actually a crane

455
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
So?

456
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
I really wondered why

457
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
In the end, what that means is that

458
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:16,000
The legs of a crane are actually about 4 meters long

459
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Downwards?

460
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
It's a fence!

461
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
It's a fence!

462
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
It's like this thing that comes out of the ground

463
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
It's still growing in the middle

464
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
There's this thing in the middle of the long part

465
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
There is

466
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
There's still more down there

467
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Depending on how hard it is, there are a few

468
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
There are times like this too

469
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
What?

470
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
There are times when it goes in like this

471
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Ah, when there's a hard rock underneath

472
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
So it's called a fence

473
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
There are times like that

474
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
It's diagonal

475
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I don't think I've seen anything like this before

476
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
If it goes BAM! it won't break

477
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
It won't break

478
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
It's going all the way down

479
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
If it goes BAM from the side, it'll break

480
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:12,000
That's because they've done a lot of things like that before

481
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
The old cranes used to break

482
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Ah, really?

483
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
But they said, this isn't good, let's gather

484
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Gather!

485
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Gather!

486
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
They said, what is it?

487
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
What is it?

488
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
A lot of things came

489
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Too much

490
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
I'm sorry

491
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
You were there

492
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Toshimitsu, you were there

493
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Who is it?

494
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Who is it?

495
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Toshimitsu!

496
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Toshimitsu of the crane

497
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Yes, what is it?

498
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
What is it?

499
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Toryo

500
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Toryo?

501
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
No, not Toryo

502
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Erai-san's crane

503
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
You can't do it

504
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Let's gather some wood

505
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Let's make some noise

506
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
It's yellow

507
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Let's make some noise, let's confirm

508
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
It's dangerous

509
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Nagai-san, there's this too

510
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
How do you do that?

511
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Hurry up and erase it

512
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Now I'm one of the old cranes

513
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:49,000
The first time I did it was 26

514
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
6 years ago

515
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
6 years ago

516
00:23:52,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Thank you very much
