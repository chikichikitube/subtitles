1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The game is called, If you make a person laugh, you win.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
And this time, it's a casting competition.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Everyone will be asked,

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Why is this person on our show?

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Why is this person on our show?

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Everyone will be cast.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
One or two people each.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Those people will be asked to laugh.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Let's do it.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
If you laugh, you lose.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
The person with the worst grades will get a bad prize.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
This show is brought to you by this sponsor.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Let's decide on the order of the parents.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Is there anyone who is confident?

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Can I go first?

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Of course, if you're confident, you can cast.

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
That's right.

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
What do you think?

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'll go first.

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Tanaka will go first.

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Young man.

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Everyone except Tanaka,

23
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
will get 10,000 points.

24
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Please cast.

25
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'll go first.

26
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'll go first.

27
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'll go first.

28
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'll go first.

29
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'll go first.

30
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'll go first.

31
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'll go first.

32
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'll go first.

33
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Let's go.

34
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
First, Tanaka will cast.

35
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'll go first.

36
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I'll go first.

37
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Oh, my love, my darling.

38
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I've hungered for your touch.

39
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:26,000
It's coming out.

40
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
It's fun to look for it.

41
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
It's coming out.

42
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
No, no, no.

43
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
When it came out, I was in the front.

44
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
There's that, too.

45
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
It's fun.

46
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
But did you see it?

47
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Did you see it?

48
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
It's Ibuki Goroh.

49
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
To be honest, I've never seen it before.

50
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
You were surprised, weren't you?

51
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Tanaka, Endo and Yamasaki didn't laugh.

52
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I was surprised.

53
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Yamasaki 2,500, Endo 2,000.

54
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Suddenly, Okita's casting.

55
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Tanaka, plus 1,000 points.

56
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Who's going next?

57
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Let me go.

58
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I want to get this back as soon as possible.

59
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I see.

60
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
So you're the boss.

61
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Go ahead.

62
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Endo 2,000.

63
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I'll go 2,500.

64
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
2,000.

65
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Who's going to win?

66
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Are you going home?

67
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Are you going home?

68
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Let's go.

69
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Matsumoto is the boss.

70
00:03:32,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Yamasaki 4,000, Start!

71
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Endo 2,500, Endo 2,000.

72
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
It was hard to judge.

73
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Tanaka didn't make a mistake either.

74
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I was patient.

75
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Yamasaki didn't make a mistake either.

76
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Really?

77
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Yamasaki has a normal face.

78
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
He's got a normal face.

79
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Endo 2,500, Endo 2,000.

80
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
How was it?

81
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
It's safe.

82
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Matsumoto got 0 points.

83
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I'll go.

84
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I'll go 3,000.

85
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Zaki.

86
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I'll go 2,000.

87
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I can't go 2,000.

88
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I'll go 1,500.

89
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
1,500?

90
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Let's go.

91
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I don't have any money left.

92
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I have to win.

93
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I have to win.

94
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
2,000?

95
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
2,000.

96
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Let's go.

97
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Yamasaki 4,000, Start!

98
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
What?

99
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Who is it?

100
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
It's a coward.

101
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
It's a coward.

102
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
It's a coward.

103
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
It's funny.

104
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I thought it was a grandma.

105
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
It's a grandma.

106
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Thank you.

107
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
This is huge.

108
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Thank you.

109
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
This is really dirty.

110
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
You're really dirty.

111
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Can't you go to the second round?

112
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Everyone is recruited for a quick casting.

113
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Yamazaki gets 8,000 points.

114
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Next.

115
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Endo, tell me honestly.

116
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Are you confident?

117
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Well, well.

118
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
2,500.

119
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I'll go with 2,500.

120
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
2,500.

121
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
2,500.

122
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
That's a little.

123
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
It's a little.

124
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
It's a little.

125
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I understand.

126
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I want to go to the last round.

127
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Endo is the son of his parents.

128
00:06:46,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Light.

129
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Endo.

130
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Okay.

131
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
It wasn't good.

132
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Are you okay?

133
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Everyone didn't laugh.

134
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Everyone is safe.

135
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Endo's parents are minus 7,000 points.

136
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Please cast.

137
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I'll go with 2,000.

138
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I'll go with 2,000.

139
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I'll go with 2,500.

140
00:07:52,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I'll go with 2,000.

141
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:42,000
It's a job meeting.

142
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I saw it yesterday.

143
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I saw it yesterday and saw it today.

144
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I saw it, but I'm being watched.

145
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I'm strong.

146
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Wait a minute.

147
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
That's what you said.

148
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I knew who was going to win.

149
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I can't do it.

150
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I can't do it.

151
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Endo Matsumoto is in the pot.

152
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I'll go.

153
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Second stage.

154
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I'll go with 3,500.

155
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I'll go with 3,500.

156
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I'll go with 3,500.

157
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I'll go with 3,500.

158
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I'll go with 3,500.

159
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I'll go with 3,500.

160
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I have to go.

161
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Tanaka's laugh is the only one.

162
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Tanaka's laugh is the only one.

163
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Tanaka's laugh is the only one.

164
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I had to take it.

165
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I have to take it.

166
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I'll go with 3,500.

167
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,400
$3,500.

168
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,900
$3,000.

169
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:27,400
$3,000 for Endo.

170
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,400
$2,500.

171
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:31,100
Okay, let's go.

172
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:34,000
Second Stage, I Am My Father's Glittering Flower.

173
00:10:34,000 --> 00:11:02,900
Ready!

174
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:08,000
That's how you do it.

175
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,800
I watch it every week.

176
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,200
You don't know?

177
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,000
What?

178
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:15,800
You don't know?

179
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,000
Matsumoto-san, you don't know?

180
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,700
What?

181
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:21,500
What are you talking about?

182
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:25,000
Hamada got 1,500 points from our staff.

183
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,700
In the process, Hamada got 1st place on both stages.

184
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:30,800
Matsumoto built the stage.

185
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,800
Okay, let's go.

186
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:36,800
There's not much time left.

187
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,000
Okay.

188
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,400
The car is here.

189
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:43,100
If you win, you'll be in the top 10.

190
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:43,800
Let's go.

191
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,100
I Am My Father's Glittering Flower.

192
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,800
Start!

193
00:11:47,800 --> 00:12:08,800
Oh, my love, my darling, I've hungered for your touch alone.

194
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:19,800
Oh, my love, my darling, I've hungered for your touch alone.

195
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:24,800
This is fun.

196
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:33,800
This is fun.

197
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:34,800
Thank you.

198
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,800
That was close.

199
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:37,800
$4,000.

200
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,800
$4,000.

201
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,800
If it wasn't for that grade.

202
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:42,800
That's right.

203
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:51,800
Oh, my love, my darling, I've hungered for your touch alone.

204
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:52,800
Okay, I'm in.

205
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,800
You're in, right?

206
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:54,800
Yes.

207
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:55,800
Okay.

208
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:56,800
All of them?

209
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:57,800
Matsumoto-san is the last one.

210
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:58,800
I'm the last one.

211
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,800
How many points do you have, Tanaka?

212
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:01,800
I'm in the top 10.

213
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,800
What?

214
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,800
I'm in the top 10.

215
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,800
Really?

216
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:06,800
Yes.

217
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,800
I'm still in the top 10.

218
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:09,800
Really?

219
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,800
You're that good?

220
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,800
Yes.

221
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,800
Yamada-san is in the top 10.

222
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,800
That's amazing.

223
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:16,800
I'm in the top 10.

224
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,800
Yes.

225
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:18,800
I'm in the top 10.

226
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,800
Yamada-san is in the top 10.

227
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,800
Let's go.

228
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,800
I Am My Father's Glittering Flower.

229
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,800
Start!

230
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:43,800
Oh, my love, my darling, I've hungered for your touch alone.

231
00:13:43,800 --> 00:14:02,800
Oh, my love, my darling, I've hungered for your touch alone.

232
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,800
Okay.

233
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:10,800
That was close.

234
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,800
I knew you couldn't do it.

235
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,800
But then you hit the ball going like this.

236
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:16,800
Really?

237
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,800
Anyway, anyone would laugh.

238
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,800
You fell for it.

239
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:22,800
I did.

240
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,800
I'm in the top 10.

241
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:24,800
Okay.

242
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:29,800
The forever-final idol, Tsuyoshi, will get plus 6500 points.

243
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:34,800
To be honest, if I lose the game, I can't pay the money.

244
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,800
How much do you have left?

245
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:36,800
Zero.

246
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,800
I thought you had zero.

247
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,800
If you lose, it's over.

248
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,800
Even if you cry and laugh, this is the last one.

249
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,800
How much is it, Mr. Tanaka?

250
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,800
5,500 yen.

251
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,800
Mr. Endo?

252
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,800
5,000 yen.

253
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:54,800
Mr. Yamazaki, that's...

254
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,800
8,000 yen.

255
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,800
I think he'll be number one.

256
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,800
Mr. Hamada?

257
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:02,800
6,000 yen.

258
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:07,800
If you win all of these, you'll be number one, right?

259
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:08,800
That's for sure.

260
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:09,800
That's right, right?

261
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:10,800
Yes.

262
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:11,800
That's good.

263
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,800
It's just as I thought.

264
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,800
Now, let's go. This is the last one.

265
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:19,800
Now, Nieramekko, start!

266
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:29,800
Nieramekko

267
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:53,800
Nieramekko

268
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:16,800
Nieramekko

269
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,800
That's dirty!

270
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,800
Now, the results are out.

271
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,800
The winner is 25,500 yen, Mr. Matsumoto!

272
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:30,800
Thank you!

273
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,800
This is the last one.

274
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:33,800
Thank you very much.

275
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,800
This is the last one.

276
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:39,800
It's a bit like the debut of Ima-dan.

277
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:47,800
Ima-dan

278
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:51,800
Don't fall for me!

279
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:55,800
Ima-dan

280
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:56,800
Hamada's

281
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:57,800
Hamada's

282
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,800
Hamada's ears are

283
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:03,800
Ima-dan

284
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:06,800
It's blowing in the wind!

285
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:15,800
That's funny.

286
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,800
At a time like this, do your best.

287
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:18,800
That's right.

288
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:19,800
Do your best and go home.

289
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:20,800
That's right.

290
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,800
I went to Russia.

291
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:23,800
Before that?

292
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:24,800
Yes.

293
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:25,800
I went there to have fun.

294
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,800
Russia is amazing.

295
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,800
I'm surprised.

296
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:30,800
Where?

297
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:35,800
It's surprisingly cheap.

298
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:36,800
I went to the strip.

299
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:39,800
Why?

300
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,800
Why did you go to Russia and go to the strip?

301
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,800
Russia is a strip.

302
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,800
It's a Hiroshiki strip.

303
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,800
I know Hiroshiki, but I don't know the strip.

304
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:50,800
I went to the strip.

305
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,800
When the Russians came out, they said,

306
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:53,800
Chichi-be-ron.

307
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:54,800
I said,

308
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,800
Be-ron-ron-be-ron.

309
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:59,800
I'm sorry.

310
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,800
I don't know the strip.

311
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,800
I'm sorry.

312
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:04,800
I'm sitting.

313
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,800
You're sitting.

314
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,800
When the chips come, they say,

315
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,800
Chichi-be-ron.

316
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,800
Be-ron-ron-be-ron.

317
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,800
Chichi-be-ron-be-ron.

318
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:15,800
I said,

319
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:16,800
Chichi-be-ron-be-ron.

320
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:17,800
I went with the staff.

321
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:18,800
Kurama-san, you're wearing glasses, right?

322
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,800
Kurama-san took off his glasses.

323
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,800
He said,

324
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,800
Be-ron-be-ron-be-ron.

325
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:25,800
What do you do?

326
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:26,800
You return it?

327
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:27,800
I returned it.

328
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,800
I took a spoon of coffee.

329
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:30,800
I said,

330
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:31,800
Ero-e-ro-e-ro-ro.

331
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:32,800
I put it in the cup.

332
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:33,800
I put it in the cup.

333
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:34,800
It's a cup.

334
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,800
I'm working really hard.

335
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:37,800
And the chips.

336
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,800
When the money was given,

337
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,800
He gave me 10 rubles.

338
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:43,800
How much is that in Japanese yen?

339
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:44,800
I drank 10 rubles.

340
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:45,800
I said,

341
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:46,800
Arigatou.

342
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:47,800
I was very happy.

343
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:48,800
I returned it.

344
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:51,800
10 rubles is in yen.

345
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,800
It's 40 yen.

346
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,800
40 yen is a huge amount of money.

347
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:59,800
Which woman would give 40 yen?

348
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:02,800
Even my woman wouldn't do it.

349
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:03,800
She wouldn't do it.

350
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:04,800
She wouldn't do it.

351
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:05,800
She wouldn't do it.

352
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:06,800
She wouldn't do it.

353
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:24,800
Hey, Akagi.

354
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,800
What is this?

355
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,800
Can I read it?

356
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:33,800
Yes, please.

357
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,800
I am the director of Gaki no Tsukai.

358
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:44,800
My name is Akihiro Onuma.

359
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,800
Since the last time I was on a TV show,

360
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:51,800
My life has changed a lot.

361
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:52,800
When I walk in the city,

362
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:55,800
People point their fingers at me.

363
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,800
When I go on a trip to Hakone,

364
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,800
People surround me.

365
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:01,800
When I go to my sister-in-law's house,

366
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:05,800
I quit my part-time job.

367
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:06,800
But recently,

368
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:09,800
I have received incredible information.

369
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:13,800
There was a man who was more stingy than me.

370
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:17,800
His name is Matsumoto.

371
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,800
Why?

372
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,800
Why?

373
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:23,800
Wait a minute.

374
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:30,800
Why do you keep looking at me?

375
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,800
I am extremely stingy.

376
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,800
I cause a lot of trouble to people around me.

377
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:35,800
At this time,

378
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:39,800
Shouldn't we pursue the truth thoroughly in court?

379
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:40,800
Next week,

380
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:51,800
I will apply for the trial of Matsumoto Hitoshi.

381
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:52,800
Wait a minute.

382
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,800
Why are you looking at me?

383
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:58,800
Why are you getting a little closer?

384
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,800
I am extremely stingy.

385
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:01,800
I am not stingy at all.

386
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,800
I am telling you.

387
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,800
There is a video clip.

388
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:08,800
There is a man who is showing off.

389
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:09,800
Let's watch it.

390
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:10,800
Today? Now?

391
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:21,800
Yes.

392
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,800
I went to the pool once.

393
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,800
Pool?

394
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,800
With the usual members.

395
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:27,800
Who is the usual member?

396
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,800
Matsumoto.

397
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:32,800
You are so stingy.

398
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:35,800
The pool at the hotel costs 5,000 yen on weekdays.

399
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:36,800
It was a public hotel.

400
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,800
I went there on a Sunday.

401
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,800
The price of the pool is 2,000 yen.

402
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:44,800
I was angry with the price of the pool.

403
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,800
I decided to go to another pool.

404
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:50,800
I went to the pool next to the golf course.

405
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,800
The price of the pool was 4,500 yen.

406
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:55,800
It was very cheap.

407
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:58,800
I added 500 yen.

408
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:01,800
It looked like a restaurant inside.

409
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:04,800
I asked if I could eat two.

410
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,800
What should I do?

411
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,800
500 yen?

412
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:12,800
I asked for a four-person meal ticket.

413
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,800
I asked if I could eat two meals.

414
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:17,800
The price of curry was 1,000 yen.

415
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:20,800
The price of ice coffee was 600 yen.

416
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,800
I asked for curry and ice coffee.

417
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,800
I asked if I could eat it for 500 yen.

418
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,800
I was glad.

419
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,800
It was the first time.

420
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,800
I knew it was 1,000 yen.

421
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,800
You are stingy.

422
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:40,800
Are you stingy?

423
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,800
I went to a 5,000 yen pool.

424
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:45,800
The price of the pool is 2,000 yen on weekdays.

425
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:48,800
See you later.

426
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:53,800
If the price of the pool is 2,000 yen, give me 2,000 yen.

427
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:56,800
That's stingy.

428
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,800
That's stingy.

429
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,800
That's stingy.

430
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:01,800
I don't want you to give me.

431
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,800
That's stingy.

432
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:09,800
Give me 40 yen.

433
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,800
I just did it.

434
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:17,800
Next week, we will talk about the trial of the judge.

435
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:22,800
The original video of the game, the legend of the 20th century.

436
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:23,800
Part 1.

437
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:26,800
It will be released on October 21.

438
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:29,800
100 people will be selected from 5 people.

439
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:32,800
We will give you a picture book of the best selection.

440
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:38,800
This program was provided by the sponsor you are watching.

441
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:42,800
You can find the body of a concrete nail that is seen as the president of an unknown place.
