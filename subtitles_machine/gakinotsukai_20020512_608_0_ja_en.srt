1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
It's been a long time.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
It's been a long time.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Hello, hello.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
No, no, no.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Everyone is full of energy.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
That's good, that's good.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
At the end, everyone is going to cry.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Are you going to cry?

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I'm going to cry.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I'm going to cry at the end.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
What a show.

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
That's right.

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
What is that?

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
This program is brought to you by these sponsors.

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Why do I always lose?

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It's the rules.

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I want to kill him.

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I don't even want to say his name.

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm going to pull out all of his internal organs.

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Tonight.

21
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I can't help it.

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I lost.

23
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
That's true.

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
My parents told me.

25
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Even if everyone was caught, you'd be the one flying.

26
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
That's right.

27
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Even if I'm not the one flying, I'm the one flying the most.

28
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
That's right.

29
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
But in total...

30
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I don't have enough.

31
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Why is he running?

32
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
What?

33
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Let's go.

34
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Let's go.

35
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I did it.

36
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I did it.

37
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I did it.

38
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I did it.

39
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:50,000
When I'm flying, I can't help it. I'm scared. I'm scared of how high I'm going to fly.

40
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Don't make that sound.

41
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'm running, so I can't help it.

42
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
He's really...

43
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
He's really...

44
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,000
How has he lived until now? And where will he go from now on?

45
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I don't know.

46
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I haven't heard anything about it.

47
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
But there was no phone call like,

48
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I feel sorry for Machan.

49
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Not at all.

50
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
If it were me, I'd think about it.

51
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I feel sorry for Machan.

52
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Who is he talking to on the phone?

53
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Who is he talking to?

54
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Who? Who are you talking about?

55
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
It doesn't matter.

56
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
It doesn't matter.

57
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
You're so shocking.

58
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
And he's been whispering something like a punishment game.

59
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I've been telling you before this.

60
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
If I lose, I'll get a punishment.

61
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Let's look it up in the dictionary you have.

62
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
What's a punishment?

63
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
What punishment?

64
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I just lost.

65
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
No, no, no, no. This is a problem.

66
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
What?

67
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I can't help it.

68
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I lost.

69
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
That's tough.

70
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
But I didn't think he would...

71
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Huh?

72
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I thought the same thing. I didn't think it would be that bad.

73
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
If he was flying as much as we did, it would be no doubt.

74
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
No doubt.

75
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Because...

76
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
He didn't fly half of us.

77
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I'm really surprised.

78
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I think he's getting the hang of it.

79
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
What?

80
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
It's like a hop, step, jump.

81
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
But...

82
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
That's all there was to it.

83
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
But one thing I think was good was...

84
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I think my share went up a lot.

85
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
What was it?

86
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
There's no other 38-year-old who can jump this much.

87
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
It was amazing.

88
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
What was with that jump?

89
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Well, he did fly.

90
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I wonder where the spring comes from.

91
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I don't know.

92
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I'm serious.

93
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
But you're only good at jumping.

94
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I'm...

95
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
You're also good at high-jumping.

96
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
That's right.

97
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
You're not good at ball games at all.

98
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Well...

99
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
It feels like it's coming to me.

100
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I don't know for sure.

101
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
You don't know for sure?

102
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
It suddenly came to you.

103
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
You're good at ball games.

104
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
What are you talking about?

105
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
That's right.

106
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
What should I do?

107
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
It can't be helped.

108
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
It can't be helped that you've already done it.

109
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I'll leave it to you this time.

110
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Leave it to me?

111
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I haven't made that many mistakes.

112
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Let's make it a softer punishment game.

113
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
That's why the other day, we played tag three times, right?

114
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
That was when you guys lost, right?

115
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
30% more tag.

116
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
30% more tag for that? I'll probably die.

117
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
And you guys are four.

118
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
It's fine if you're four.

119
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
If I'm alone, I'll definitely be chased until I'm caught.

120
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
There's no point in running away.

121
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
No, no, no.

122
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
There's still that.

123
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
There's still that.

124
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Seriously.

125
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I can't punish that idiot.

126
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I'll think about it.

127
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Yuta is also my responsibility.

128
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
That's right.

129
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
You'll have to do something about that.

130
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
That's right.

131
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Seriously.

132
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I don't know what to do about that.

133
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
That's not it.

134
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I wanted to make the rules a bit clearer before the game was over.

135
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I wanted to make it look like it was my team.

136
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I wanted to make it look like it was my team.

137
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
What is that?

138
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Have you ever seen it live?

139
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
You haven't, have you?

140
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
It's even smaller.

141
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
It's smaller than it looks.

142
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
It's smaller than it looks.

143
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Even if I ate it, I wouldn't be that full.

144
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I'd be hungry again in about two hours.

145
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
You're not hungry.

146
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I'm not hungry.

147
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I'm really looking forward to it.

148
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Let's do it.

149
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
The other day, there was something that surprised me.

150
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
What is it?

151
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
It's a store that I go to often.

152
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
It's really good.

153
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
It's really small.

154
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
There's a private room in the back.

155
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I thought it was nice, so I went there sometimes.

156
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Everyone had noticed it before.

157
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
It's a private room for five or six people.

158
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
So it's really small.

159
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Everyone had noticed it before.

160
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
One of the employees was really...

161
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Level 4.

162
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
So where's Max?

163
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
He's Level 4.

164
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
He's completely dangerous.

165
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Because he has a thousand private rooms.

166
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Even if he doesn't have one, he has one.

167
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
If it's Level 4, he has one.

168
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
He has one.

169
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
He has a lot of them in his room.

170
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
It's in our hearts.

171
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
It's in everyone's hearts.

172
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
It's in the ceiling.

173
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
It's in our hearts.

174
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
It's in our noses.

175
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
His memories are...

176
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
If that's the case, you shouldn't have gone.

177
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
But it's really good.

178
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
When I went the other day, it was a little hot.

179
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
It was a little steamy.

180
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
It was terrible.

181
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
When I put it down, it came out like this.

182
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
It came out like this.

183
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Under his hand.

184
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Under his hand.

185
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
It's really like CG.

186
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
It's really good.

187
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Even if you eat it, it's really good.

188
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
You shouldn't do that.

189
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I don't like that kind of thing.

190
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
It's because it's food.

191
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
It's because it's food.

192
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I called the manager.

193
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I asked him to change the person who would bring it to the table.

194
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I see.

195
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I was wondering what the reason was.

196
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I had to do it quickly.

197
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I couldn't do that.

198
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Then Yamazaki said,

199
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I'm sorry.

200
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
He came back and said,

201
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
The manager will be here soon.

202
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I was wondering what he would say.

203
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
He came to me and said,

204
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
The manager will be here soon.

205
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
He's that guy.

206
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
He's that guy.

207
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
You?

208
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I said,

209
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Is that so?

210
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I couldn't say anything.

211
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
That's why.

212
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I was told to call the manager.

213
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I thought there was something.

214
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
My face looked like a fish.

215
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I was wondering what it was.

216
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I said,

217
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
It's okay.

218
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
What is it?

219
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
What is it?

220
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I'm sorry.

221
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I misunderstood.

222
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I'm sorry.

223
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I want to say it.

224
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I want to say it.

225
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I often say that.

226
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
That's terrible.

227
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I couldn't help it.

228
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I couldn't help it.

229
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I couldn't help it.

230
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
There was a stupid guy.

231
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
He was bald.

232
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
He was a waiter.

233
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
He said,

234
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
You're not bad.

235
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I didn't understand what he said.

236
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
He said,

237
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I like you.

238
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I want you to be in charge of this table today.

239
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I asked him 40 minutes ago.

240
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
He didn't come yet.

241
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
He forgot.

242
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I called him again.

243
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
He said,

244
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
You forgot.

245
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
He said,

246
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Is that a good reaction?

247
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
It's true.

248
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I told him to behave.

249
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
It's not harmful to eat at the counter.

250
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
That's right.

251
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
It's not good to eat at the counter.

252
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
But it's still May.

253
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I'm going to play a game.

254
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
That's terrible.

255
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I couldn't help it.

256
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I couldn't understand it.

257
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I felt sorry for him.

258
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
There was a girl who guided me.

259
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I think she was angry.

260
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
She said,

261
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Did you do something?

262
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I see.

263
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
That's why I was called.

264
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
No.

265
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
It's you.

266
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
It's you.

267
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Everyone knows that.

268
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
But I'm good at it.

269
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I don't know what to do.

270
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
If I don't do it well,

271
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I can make you understand.

272
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Are you talking about me?

273
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
That's hard.

274
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I'm careful about it.

275
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I hate it.

276
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I'm careful about it.

277
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Are you okay?

278
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
There are a lot of people.

279
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I don't like it.

280
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
But if you say,

281
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I saw a child's desk.

282
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I'll be angry.

283
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Also,

284
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I saw a child's bra.

285
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I can't close this.

286
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
That's right.

287
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
It's a child's thing.

288
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
This is a child's thing.

289
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
It's funny.

290
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
It's funny.

291
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I don't think so.

292
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I'm a store manager.

293
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I'm a store manager.

294
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
That's right.

295
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
It's okay.

296
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
But indirectly,

297
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I was saying something about you.

298
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I can't say it.

299
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
If I can say it, I'll do something.

300
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
That's right.

301
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
It's better to be aware of it.

302
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
That's right.

303
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Say the name of the store.

304
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
People around you,

305
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
look at this.

306
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
It doesn't have to be that person.

307
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Maybe it's a customer service.

308
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
That's right.

309
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
That's no good.

310
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Really.

311
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I have a talent.

312
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
It's just a problem with the costume.

313
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
There are a lot of food stores.

314
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
That's right.

315
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
You have to be careful.

316
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Let's stop.

317
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I have a question for Mr. Matsumoto.

318
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
The other day,

319
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I saw an angel with broken wings.

320
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Where did you see it?

321
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I saw it at the pet shop.

322
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
You saw it at the pet shop?

323
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I saw it at the pet shop.

324
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Inside?

325
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I saw it inside.

326
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
It was sold.

327
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
It was sold?

328
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Because it was broken.

329
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
It was sold because it was broken?

330
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
That's right.

331
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Why?

332
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
It was about 32,000 yen.

333
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
It's cheap.

334
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
It's not cheap.

335
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
But it can't be helped.

336
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
No one will buy it.

337
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
You should have fixed it first.

338
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
You shouldn't have sold it even though it was broken.

339
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
It was full of poop.

340
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
It's a cleaning product.

341
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
This one was broken.

342
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
This one is slightly moving.

343
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
This one is broken.

344
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
It's because it's hot.

345
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
You should have noticed it first.

346
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
If you show it, it won't be good.

347
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
On the contrary.

348
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
The old lady said,

349
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I put in some food.

350
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
You put in some food?

351
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I put in some food.

352
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
It hurts.

353
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
It's not dry at all.

354
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
It hurts.

355
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
It hurts.

356
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I put in some food.

357
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
It hurts.

358
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
What are you doing?

359
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Please wake up.

360
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I was struggling.

361
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
It hurts.

362
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Where did you catch it?

363
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I was helping.

364
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
What are you doing?

365
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
What are you doing?

366
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
It was 32,000 yen.

367
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
It hurts.

368
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
It's hard to see.

369
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
It's strange.

370
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
When it's broken, it looks like a Toyoji.

371
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Really?

372
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
When it's like this, it looks like a European one.

373
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
When it's broken, it looks like...

374
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
The man who understands women's feelings the most in the entertainment world.

375
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
That's right.

376
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Please tell me how to hire a woman who isn't embarrassed.

377
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Is it embarrassing?

378
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Women?

379
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
You can't hire a woman who is embarrassed.

380
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Is that so?

381
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Everyone thinks too much.

382
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I see.

383
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
There are men who are embarrassed sometimes.

384
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I see.

385
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
There are men who can't hire a woman who is embarrassed.

386
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
They think too much.

387
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
It's okay to be normal.

388
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I will hire a normal woman.

389
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
When I want to watch a normal movie,

390
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
or when I want to hire a woman for a movie,

391
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I dare to make a movie with this.

392
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I don't like it.

393
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I don't want to hide my English.

394
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I want to watch it.

395
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I want to watch it in order.

396
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
That's how I feel.

397
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
That's how you feel.

398
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
What do you think?

399
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Do you want to hire a woman?

400
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I don't know.

401
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I think I want to hire a woman.

402
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
But it's hard to hire a woman.

403
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Is it hard to hire a woman?

404
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
If there is a way to hire a woman.

405
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
There are many ways.

406
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Is that so?

407
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Please tell me.

408
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I look at her.

409
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
This is me.

410
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I am popular.

411
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I miss her.

412
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
And this.

413
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I can't look at her.

414
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
This is a lie.

415
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Are you embarrassed?

416
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I'm embarrassed.

417
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Is that so?

418
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Men are embarrassed.

419
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Women are not embarrassed.

420
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Have you ever seen an AV?

421
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
It's cool.

422
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
It's cool.

423
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
It's cool.

424
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
You should watch it.

425
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
It's not good.

426
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
You should watch it.

427
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
That's right.

428
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I like you and Imada.

429
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
How much do you like Imada?

430
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
That's terrible.

431
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
That's terrible.

432
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I bought a lot of self-videos.

433
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I borrowed money.

434
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I borrowed money.

435
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I borrowed money.

436
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I watched the AV on the night of the day.

437
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
It was different from that.

438
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I could watch it anytime.

439
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I could watch it now.

440
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I could watch it today.

441
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
That's great.

442
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Do you feel the same way?

443
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I haven't watched it since I joined this year.

444
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
What?

445
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I haven't watched it.

446
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I haven't watched it.

447
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I watched it for about five minutes.

448
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
I've been watching it a lot lately.

449
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:13,000
I've been watching it a lot until the end.

450
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
That's right.

451
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
It's cool.

452
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I haven't watched it until the end.

453
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Really?

454
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I have to tell you my point.

455
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Your point?

456
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,000
You also tell me your point.

457
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
My point.

458
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
What's your point?

459
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,000
My point and your point are different.

460
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
That's different.

461
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
That's right.

462
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
It's all the same now.

463
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
That's strange.

464
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
When I look at the line, I want to see it lined up.

465
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I have a question for Mr. Matsumoto.

466
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:03,000
What are you waiting for when you follow the line of ants?

467
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
What?

468
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
There are many things waiting.

469
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Have you ever followed the line of ants?

470
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
No.

471
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
It's better to follow the line of ants.

472
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Have you ever followed the line of ants?

473
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I have.

474
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I stopped following the line of ants halfway.

475
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I've followed the line of ants for a long time.

476
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
What did you see?

477
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I don't know where it started.

478
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I can't explain where I stopped following the line of ants.

479
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I don't care about that.

480
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I followed the line of ants because I found ants.

481
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I followed the line of ants until something came out.

482
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
What did you find?

483
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
What do you mean?

484
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
What are you waiting for?

485
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
I'm waiting for something sweet.

486
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I see.

487
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
That's normal. I've seen it.

488
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Something sweet?

489
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I've been walking with candy in my hand.

490
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I've never seen it.

491
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Don't give candy to an old man who is 40 years old.

492
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
You are a fool.

493
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
You are the type who says, ''Age-san''.

494
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I can't say ''Age-san''.

495
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
You say, ''Oimo-san''.

496
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Do you want to be cute like that?

497
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Everyone in Osaka calls you ''Ame-chan''.

498
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
I don't call you ''Ame-chan''.

499
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
You used to.

500
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I call you ''Candy''.

501
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
You used to call me ''Ame-chan''.

502
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
I never call you ''Ame-chan''.

503
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
What is it?

504
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
What are you waiting for?

505
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
You've been waiting for something sweet.

506
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
I've been waiting for something sweet.

507
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
That's normal.

508
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
What do you want to be when you grow up?

509
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
That's right.

510
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
What is it?

511
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
How long have you been following him?

512
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
What are you talking about?

513
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Just say it.

514
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
About 20 meters.

515
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
You've been following him for 20 meters?

516
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
It must be hard to follow him for 20 meters.

517
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,000
The problem is that the width of the ant is different from ours.

518
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,000
It must be hard to follow him all the time.

519
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
But still, let's try it.

520
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
That's why I did it.

521
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I'm not going to go straight.

522
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
There are times when I go through the wall.

523
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:39,000
I'm not going to go straight. There are times when I go through the wall.

524
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I'm not going to lose today.

525
00:21:42,000 --> 00:22:02,000
I'm not going to lose today.

526
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Congratulations.

527
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Why are you so angry?

528
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Why?

529
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Why are you so angry?

530
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
I did it about two months ago.

531
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
What?

532
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
It feels like that. It's too early.

533
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I see.

534
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
But it's a big celebration.

535
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
It's already changed.

536
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
I thought that introduction was interesting.

537
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
I thought that introduction was interesting.

538
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
It's already changed.

539
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
It's a big celebration.

540
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
It's already changed.

541
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Mori Sanchu isn't here.

542
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
He might be here.

543
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
He might be here.

544
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
At times like this, this time...

545
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Oh, you're going to sing?

546
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Thank you.

547
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Thank you.

548
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Happy birthday to you.

549
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Happy birthday to you.

550
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Happy birthday, dear Hamachan.

551
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Happy birthday to you.

552
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
To you?

553
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
To war?

554
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Hamachan!

555
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
39 years old!

556
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Thank you!

557
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Thank you in English!

558
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Let's do it!

559
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Cheers!

560
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:38,000
