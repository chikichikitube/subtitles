1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Thank you very much!

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I'll think of something new.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Can you make a big movement of a new game from this program?

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Sure.

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
What kind of game do you want?

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Let's start with rock-paper-scissors.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Rock-paper-scissors.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I can only say rock-paper-scissors.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
No one can do that.

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
You want to win, don't you?

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I can't think of anything.

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
It's hot.

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
It's strange that I can only say rock-paper-scissors.

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
So I have to turn the game around, right?

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Turn the game around.

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Why do I have to turn the game around?

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Turn the game around.

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Rock-paper-scissors.

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
You win.

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I win.

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Sorry, can I say the broadcast code?

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
What?

24
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
It's not funny at all.

25
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
What is this?

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
If you don't change the game from there, nothing will change.

27
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
That's right.

28
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
That's right.

29
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm in trouble.

30
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
You play rock-paper-scissors, right?

31
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
If you lose, you lose.

32
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
If I lose, it's your fault.

33
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I can't say I won here.

34
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
If I say I won, I have to say the broadcast code.

35
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Do you understand?

36
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
If I can't say it, the broadcast code will continue.

37
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
What does that mean?

38
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Rock-paper-scissors.

39
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
What does that mean?

40
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
What does that mean?

41
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Let's do it.

42
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Rock-paper-scissors.

43
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
You win.

44
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I won.

45
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
You can't sell this.

46
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
You can't sell this.

47
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
What if I do it over and over again?

48
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Let's do it over and over again.

49
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
But there are times when you can't say it, right?

50
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Let's decide that.

51
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Why can't I say it?

52
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
You can't say it?

53
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
You can't say it?

54
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I don't want to say it.

55
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
You can't say it?

56
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
You can't say it?

57
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
You can't say it?

58
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Let's do it like this.

59
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Let's do it.

60
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Wait.

61
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
What is this?

62
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I did it like this.

63
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I don't think so.

64
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Let's do it.

65
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Okay.

66
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Rock-paper-scissors.

67
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
You win!

68
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Take this!

69
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Rock-paper-scissors.

70
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
You can't say it.

71
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
When you can't say it, you can't say it.

72
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Let's do it.

73
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Rock-paper-scissors.

74
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
You can't say it!

75
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Rock-paper-scissors.

76
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
You can't say it!

77
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Rock-paper-scissors.

78
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
You can't say it.

79
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Rock-paper-scissors!

80
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Can you see it?

81
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
What do you think?

82
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
It's better than I expected.

83
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I'm surprised.

84
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Let's play with faces.

85
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
What kind of face?

86
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
The face of the theme I said.

87
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
This shop is...

88
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
This shop is...

89
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I thought this shop was bad.

90
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I thought this shop was bad.

91
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I couldn't go in because it was a neighborhood.

92
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I couldn't go in because it was a neighborhood.

93
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I happened to be there.

94
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I went in and ate it.

95
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
It was delicious.

96
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
That's your special face.

97
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
No.

98
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
You did that before.

99
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I said, do it.

100
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
That face.

101
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Please.

102
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Are you going to do everything from the beginning?

103
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Just the face?

104
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
You did it from the beginning, so I'll do it from the beginning.

105
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Just the face.

106
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Here we go.

107
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I'll just have that face.

108
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
It's totally different.

109
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
It's a big face.

110
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
That's the face of a regular customer.

111
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
The regular customer is always delicious.

112
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
The regular customer is always delicious.

113
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
The regular customer eats like this.

114
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
It's always delicious.

115
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
It's a face that says, it's delicious.

116
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
It's totally different.

117
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I'm sorry.

118
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I'll just have the face.

119
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Me?

120
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
5 seconds.

121
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:16,000
That's the face when you see something.

122
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
It's totally different.

123
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Hey!

124
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
It's 100 points to you!

125
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
That's not the face when you eat it.

126
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
No.

127
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
That's the face when you see your parent's sex.

128
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
That's the face when you see your parent's sex.

129
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
You're an experienced person.

130
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Don't have to act.

131
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I don't need it. I don't need it. I don't need it anymore.

132
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Let me do it with acting.

133
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I don't need it. I don't need it anymore.

134
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Okay, let's go.

135
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I don't need it. I don't need it.

136
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I don't need it when I say aah.

137
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I don't need aah either.

138
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Please.

139
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Okay, 5 seconds. 4, 3, 2, 1. Cut.

140
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I'm sorry.

141
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Don't look at your parents' sex and accept it.

142
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
On the round part of the tip of the nose...

143
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Ah, Matsumoto-san said that he's putting 100 million yen's insurance on it.

144
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
The other day, I thought there was no one there, so I was playing with my nose.

145
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Suddenly, a person came in and I thought it was cool.

146
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I was playing with my nose, and Matsumoto-san told me how to play with a cool nose that can be easily fooled by people.

147
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
You play with your nose, right?

148
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I play with it.

149
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
There are times when I put it in like this, right?

150
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I'm getting angry.

151
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I put my finger in like this.

152
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
What is this round thing inside?

153
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
There's something round.

154
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I've never put my finger in like this.

155
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
It's like it's spinning.

156
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
It's scary.

157
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:09,000
It's supposed to come off, but it's like this.

158
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
It's like this.

159
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
It's a little stuck on my nose.

160
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
There are times when it comes out like this.

161
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:25,000
It's a little stuck on my nose.

162
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Why?

163
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Why did you do that?

164
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I thought I shouldn't make my partner look stupid.

165
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
How do you fool people?

166
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
With a cool nose.

167
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
How do you fool people with a cool nose?

168
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Do you want me to teach you how to fool people with a cool nose?

169
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Yes, please.

170
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
For example, in a car, like I said earlier.

171
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Let's say the traffic light is waiting for a signal.

172
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:57,000
If you look at it, the guy next to you is looking at you.

173
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
This is bad.

174
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
It's bad.

175
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
At that time, let's open the window.

176
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
It makes it easier to see.

177
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Let's open it.

178
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Let's be clear.

179
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I didn't cheat on you.

180
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Don't bite me.

181
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
It's a cool way to fool people.

182
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
That's right.

183
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I didn't cheat on you.

184
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I'm telling you clearly.

185
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Then...

186
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I was cheating on you.

187
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Don't talk to me.

188
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Don't talk to me.

189
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Don't make me think I didn't do it.

190
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I understand.

191
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Don't talk to me.

192
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Don't talk to me.

193
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Open the window.

194
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,000
What is this?

195
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Is this your first experience?

196
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
No, no.

197
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I put it in here.

198
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I put it in here on my own will.

199
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
What is this?

200
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:09,000
What is this?

201
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Is that so?

202
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
That's the most...

203
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
This person...

204
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
The person who was told that.

205
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
This person doesn't even know that his nose is smelly.

206
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
That's why.

207
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
He's a strong person.

208
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Strong.

209
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
That's no good.

210
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
He's like a prince.

211
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I don't want to be called a prince.

212
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I have a question for your mother, Matsumoto.

213
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
How hard is it to give birth to a child?

214
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
What is it like?

215
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Please tell me in detail.

216
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I think...

217
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Giving birth to a child is a terrible thing.

218
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Terrible?

219
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Terrible?

220
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Do you understand?

221
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:01,000
And the child has a lot of hard and painful things in his life.

222
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,000
His mother is getting that pain to soften it even a little bit.

223
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I don't want to hear such a beautiful thing.

224
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Please tell me how hard it is.

225
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
There's a little something.

226
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Wait a minute.

227
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
What is it?

228
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
A little something.

229
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
A little something.

230
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
There's a little something like this.

231
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I've been told such a little something.

232
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
A little something.

233
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
A monkey?

234
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
It's a monkey.

235
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
It's a little something like this.

236
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
For example...

237
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I got it.

238
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
When I was camping, I was walking on the mountain road and a little something came down.

239
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
And I got hit.

240
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
It's a little something like this.

241
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
It's a little something like this.

242
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
It hurts.

243
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
My face hurts.

244
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
It's a little something like this.

245
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
It hurts.

246
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
It's a little something like this.

247
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
And why are you laughing?

248
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Why do you hit people like this?

249
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
That's not the point of the story.

250
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
That's just a little something.

251
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
That's a little something.

252
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
It doesn't hurt much.

253
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I don't understand.

254
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I don't understand.

255
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
This is the easiest way to understand.

256
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Is that so?

257
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
That's difficult.

258
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
What are you talking about?

259
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Do you have a cutter?

260
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
This is good.

261
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
What is a cutter?

262
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
A cutter knife.

263
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Yes, yes, yes.

264
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
It's something like this.

265
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
That's good.

266
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Something that's more common.

267
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
That's easy to understand.

268
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
That's right.

269
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Do you have a cutter?

270
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Yes, yes, yes.

271
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
A cutter knife.

272
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
It's all out.

273
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Yes, yes, yes.

274
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Right?

275
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Yes, yes, yes.

276
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Your nose is...

277
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
scary.

278
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
That's...

279
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
It doesn't hurt.

280
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
That's scary.

281
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
So...

282
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
How did you feel the day before?

283
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
What do you mean?

284
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Are you scared?

285
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I'm scared.

286
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Are you scared?

287
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I'm scared.

288
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Are you scared?

289
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I'm scared.

290
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Because you went all out,

291
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
when you were doing this.

292
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Are you talking about the pain you felt while doing it?

293
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Okay, let's try it.

294
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Ah, this is painful.

295
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Tell him about it.

296
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Tell him about it!

297
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Ah, this hurts.

298
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
It hurts.

299
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
This hurts.

300
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
This hurts.

301
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
But it especially hurts me.

302
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
What do you mean by that?

303
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
You're the worst!

304
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
You're a monster!

305
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
You're a monster.

306
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
In a way, I'm a monster.

307
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
What's so hard about that?

308
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
You're a middle schooler.

309
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
That pain...

310
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
To an old man at the iron mill...

311
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
To an old man at the iron mill?

312
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
To an old man at the iron mill...

313
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
To an old man at the iron mill?

314
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
That's really easy.

315
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
You're the one who's noisy, right?

316
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
You're the one who's noisy, right?

317
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
You're the one who's noisy, right?

318
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
That's my job!
