00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The New Year's Eve Gaki no Tsukai's New Year's party has come again this year.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
The 4th episode of Gaki no Tsukai Yagahara!

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Chikichiki 2003! Happy New Year!

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
The New Year's Eve Gaki no Tsukai's New Year's party!

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
This year too, we have a special guest.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
What is it?

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
What is it?

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
What did you say?

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
First of all, the energy has already reached its peak!

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Thank you very much!

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Next, Yoshimoto Ichino's butt is a mess!

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Shimagawa Shouji!

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
It's a mess!

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Next, the person who has to be in Gaki no Tsukai!

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Pheromone Venus!

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Grandma!

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Next, from the extra world...

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Black Jack!

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Yamada-san!

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Thank you very much!

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Congratulations!

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Thank you very much!

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Hey!

24
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I'm angry!

25
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Yes! What is it?

26
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I'm angry before I do this!

27
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Yes! What is it?

28
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
You guys!

29
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Why are you such a piece of shit!

30
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Yes!

31
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I don't know what to say!

32
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
It was hard to hold it in!

33
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Come with the suit!

34
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Get hit!

35
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
It's the New Year's party!

36
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Get hit by the New Year's party!

37
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Yes!

38
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
That's it!

39
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I have one more thing to say!

40
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Actually, I'm the main character of this show.

41
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
The main character?

42
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
The main character of Downtown!

43
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
The small one isn't here!

44
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
That's it, everyone!

45
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I'm really sorry!

46
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
My partner...

47
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Well, I can't say it here, but...

48
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
He got hit by the New Year's party!

49
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Really?

50
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Really?

51
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
He got hit by the New Year's party!

52
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I'm not the main character!

53
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I'm not the main character!

54
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I'll probably be in the video, too.

55
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I have a cold, so I can't sing.

56
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I'll take a break this time.

57
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
It can't be helped.

58
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Today, Hanagata-san is not here, but...

59
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Everyone, please have fun!

60
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Please!

61
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Congratulations!

62
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
This program is brought to you by these sponsors.

63
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Unfortunately, Hamada is absent this time.

64
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
However, the guests are very lively.

65
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
It's a gorgeous New Year's party suitable for the new year.

66
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
In the midst of this, this man took Hamada's seat and caught a cold.

67
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Endo, have you decided on a name?

68
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I haven't decided yet.

69
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Would you like me to put it on?

70
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Really?

71
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Yes.

72
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
If I put it on, will you definitely put it on?

73
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Well, as a candidate...

74
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
No, no.

75
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
But I don't know.

76
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
If it's a good name...

77
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
If you say you'll definitely put it on, I'll say it.

78
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Then I'll say it.

79
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
That's what happens.

80
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Why?

81
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
That's because my brother said it.

82
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
It's definitely a strange name.

83
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
But I'll say something interesting.

84
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Something interesting?

85
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I'll definitely say it.

86
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
If you don't say you'll definitely put it on...

87
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Matsumoto-san, isn't that right?

88
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I didn't hear it at all.

89
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I've never heard it so much.

90
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Ko-san, I'm sorry.

91
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I'll change my mind.

92
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I'll put it on.

93
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
You'll put it on?

94
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
If I think about it, Senpai should say that.

95
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I see.

96
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
That's absolutely right.

97
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Then in the case of a boy...

98
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
If it's a boy...

99
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Yes.

100
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:29,000
If it's a boy...

101
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I'm thinking of Miyasako.

102
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:42,000
2003 HATSUWARAI MANZAI DAIGASSEI!

103
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:49,000
From now on, we'll be your MCs. Nice to meet you.

104
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Then we'd like you to play the song.

105
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Thank you.

106
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
The new year's special program, Manzai Daigassen.

107
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Out of the 25 talent staff, 5 teams will be chosen to perform the manzai.

108
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Will they accept it or not, the fate will be decided by this lottery.

109
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
We'll start with the first team.

110
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Okay, then.

111
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
First person, start!

112
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I'll press it. Stop!

113
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Number 3!

114
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Number 3!

115
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Who will it be?

116
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Who will it be?

117
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Here you go.

118
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Mano-san, stop!

119
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
This is tough.

120
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I'd like to see Tajima-san's reaction.

121
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Here we go, start!

122
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Stop!

123
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Number 10!

124
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Number 10!

125
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Aikata, Aikata, Aikata.

126
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Yes.

127
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
This is tough.

128
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I think Tajima is tougher.

129
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
The second person is the director, Tsutsumimoto.

130
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Aikata will also be chosen by the director, Takahashi.

131
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Takahashi-san.

132
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
The third person is...

133
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
It's been a while since the last time he appeared, Producer Suga.

134
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Suga-san is the type that's really weak.

135
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
He's really weak.

136
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
He's been like this for years.

137
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
The Aikata we're curious about is...

138
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
The Aikata we're curious about is...

139
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
It's okay, it's okay.

140
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Really?

141
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Okay, the fourth group.

142
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Here we go, start!

143
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Number 3!

144
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Number 8!

145
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Yes.

146
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Thank you.

147
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Thank you.

148
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I don't like the pattern that was chosen earlier.

149
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I'll decide my own fate.

150
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Matsumoto-san's Aikata, please!

151
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Yes.

152
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Where did you get it?

153
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Why did you come?

154
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Why did you come?

155
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
The talent is overflowing.

156
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
That's right.

157
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I'll increase the number of frames.

158
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
This is the last one.

159
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Okay, the fifth group.

160
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Here we go, start!

161
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Number 3!

162
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Number 8!

163
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
It's me.

164
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
The fifth group is Shinagawa Shouji's Shouji.

165
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
And the Aikata is...

166
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Number 4!

167
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
It's me.

168
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Papariko Endo!

169
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:25,000
The first group is Yamasaki and Tajima.

170
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
The third group is Tama-chan.

171
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
The fourth group is Matsumoto and Heipo.

172
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,000
And the fifth group is Shouji and Endo.

173
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
The fifth group is the three of you?

174
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,000
That's right.

175
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Wait a minute.

176
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Let's do one more group.

177
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Let's do the sixth group.

178
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
The sixth group is...

179
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Number 9!

180
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
It's me.

181
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
The first group is Shinagawa Shouji's Shinagawa.

182
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:04,000
If I become a staff member, I'll be famous.

183
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
And the Aikata is...

184
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Number 65!

185
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Kokoriko Tanaka!

186
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I'll announce it now.

187
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:21,000
There is one person who is in charge of the six groups.

188
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
It's me!

189
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
It's me!

190
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
It's me!

191
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
It's me!

192
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
It's me!

193
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:36,000
In the end, Miyasako cried and the Aikata was Komura Saki.

194
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,000
The sixth group is Shinagawa and Kokoriko Tanaka's Bokeh duo.

195
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:46,000
And Miyasako and Komura Saki decided to go to the public bath.

196
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
The 7th group is making up a story in another room.

197
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
There are many rivals more than 0 years.

198
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Each duo has less than 4 years to meet.

199
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Number 1 who predicts the new year.

200
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
What kind of story will be made?

201
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Thank you for waiting.

202
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
The first group is Endo and Shoji.

203
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
The topic is Godzilla Matsui.

204
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Go ahead!

205
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Thank you very much.

206
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
This is a top battle.

207
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Let's do our best.

208
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
It's a major league.

209
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I've been doing it for two years.

210
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
The Aikata is an infrared.

211
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
It's strange.

212
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I don't know.

213
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Listen to the story.

214
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
2002.

215
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
World Cup soccer.

216
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Golf was Maruyama.

217
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Sports was very exciting.

218
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I love sports.

219
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Matsui was nervous.

220
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I'm not nervous at all.

221
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I'm not nervous at all.

222
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Are you nervous?

223
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I'm nervous.

224
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Matsui went to the major league.

225
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Baseball in the major league.

226
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Baseball in Japan.

227
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I had to shorten the distance.

228
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Leave me alone.

229
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Are you nervous?

230
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I'm not nervous.

231
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
But you are good.

232
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
If Matsui goes to America, I want him to swing.

233
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I want to see Matsui's swing.

234
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Don't be afraid of the result.

235
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Like this.

236
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
He is not nervous at all.

237
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
He is not nervous at all.

238
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
He is not nervous at all.

239
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
He is nervous.

240
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
He is not nervous.

241
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
He is nervous.

242
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
You're not nervous.

243
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I have a risk of 4 points.

244
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Matsui wants you to do your best.

245
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
He is a great player.

246
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Baseball is important.

247
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Base of baseball. Let's take care of the equipment.

248
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
As a baseball player, it's a must.

249
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
That's right. That's why the bat and the ball are important.

250
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Thank you very much.

251
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Thank you very much.

252
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
The second team is Hotohara-san and Suga-san.

253
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
The theme is Tama-chan.

254
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Go for it!

255
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Hello. Hello.

256
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Hello. Hello.

257
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Hello.

258
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I'm Kikuno. I'm Kikuno.

259
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I'm Oseno. I'm Oseno.

260
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Well, I'll do my best.

261
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Thank you very much.

262
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
There were many unpleasant moments last year.

263
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
There were many.

264
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
But the only one that was healed was Tama-chan in Tamagawa.

265
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
That was cute.

266
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
That was healed.

267
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
That was the only one that was healed.

268
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Ah, here is Tamagawa.

269
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Here is Tama-chan. Let's call her.

270
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Tama-chan! Tama-chan!

271
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Tama-chan? Tama-chan?

272
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Tama-chan? Is that you, Tama-chan?

273
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
You're just a middle-aged man.

274
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Eh? Is that you, Tama-chan?

275
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Ah, the TV news is coming.

276
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
The TV news is coming.

277
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Tama-chan, are you happy?

278
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Do you like TV?

279
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
It's coming out, Tama-chan.

280
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Tama-chan, it's coming out.

281
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Wow, wow, she's really happy.

282
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
She's really happy.

283
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
She really likes TV.

284
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
That's not true at all.

285
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Ah, it's coming out.

286
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
The TV news is coming out.

287
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Wow, when the TV news is coming out,

288
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
she's like a taro.

289
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Tama-chan!

290
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
She's really happy.

291
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Wow, that's scary.

292
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
What are you doing?

293
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Let's give her some food.

294
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Food, here.

295
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
She's really happy.

296
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
She's eating food.

297
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
She's really happy.

298
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
She's eating food.

299
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Let's give her some more.

300
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Wow, wow, wow.

301
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
She's eating a lot of food.

302
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
She's eating a lot of food.

303
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Tama-chan, are you happy?

304
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Are you happy?

305
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Ah, food.

306
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Ah, there's no more.

307
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
There's no more.

308
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
There's no more.

309
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Scary.

310
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Scary.

311
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
What are you doing?

312
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Hey.

313
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
It's scary.

314
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Scary, scary, scary.

315
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I'm calling her.

316
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
She's really scary.

317
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
She's slow.

318
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
What is it?

319
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Eh?

320
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Money?

321
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I don't have any money.

322
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I don't have any money.

323
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
What are you doing?

324
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Getting away.

325
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Tama-chan, you're going to win.

326
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Charing, charing.

327
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
There's no money.

328
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
What are you doing?

329
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
What are you doing?

330
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
What is it?

331
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
There's no money in there.

332
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Stop it.

333
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Hey!

334
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
What is it?

335
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Stop it.

336
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Tama-chan has a lot of money.

337
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Tama-chan has a lot of money.

338
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Hey, there are a lot of cards in there.

339
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Tama-chan, stop it.

340
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Tama-chan, stop it.

341
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
What is it?

342
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Tama-chan, where are you going?

343
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I'll stop it!

344
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I'll stop it!

345
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Sorry.

346
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Sorry.

347
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:45,000
It's fast. It's fast to go home.

348
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Yamazaki-san and Tajima manager. The topic is Shinmai Papa.

349
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Go ahead!

350
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Congratulations!

351
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Do-ya-sa...

352
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Do-ya-sa...

353
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Even though it's three carrots, it's a carrot!

354
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Do-ya-sa!

355
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Do-ya-sa!

356
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Eh-yan-kai-sa!

357
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
It's a string, a string!

358
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Yeah, a string, a string!

359
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
It's a string that doesn't come out that much!

360
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Do-ya-sa!

361
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
It's a string that doesn't come out that much!

362
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Do-ya-sa!

363
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
No way!

364
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
But, you know...

365
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I was born with a child.

366
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Mele-ta-yan-kai-sa!

367
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Mele-ta-yan-kai-sa!

368
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I was born with a child.

369
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
But it's really hard to take care of it.

370
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
It's hard to take care of it for everyone.

371
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I wanted the actors to understand.

372
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Thank you, yan-kai-sa.

373
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Thank you, right?

374
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I was born with a child.

375
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Ah!

376
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Ah!

377
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I always smile.

378
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
That's good, yan-kai-sa.

379
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
It's more strong, you know!

380
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
It's more strong!

381
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
It's embarrassing.

382
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
It's embarrassing!

383
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Do-ya-sa!

384
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Do-ya-sa!

385
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
The string...

386
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
The string doesn't come out.

387
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Ah, so...

388
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I was born with a child.

389
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Ah!

390
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I always smile brightly.

391
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
That's good, yan-kai-sa.

392
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I always smile brightly.

393
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Yan-kai-sa.

394
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Do-ya-sa.

395
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Do-ya-sa.

396
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I was born with a child.

397
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I...

398
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I always smile brightly.

399
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
You smile again, yan-kai-sa.

400
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Smiling is important.

401
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Do-ya-sa.

402
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
It's not Do-ya-sa.

403
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Smiling is important.

404
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I was born with a child.

405
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I...

406
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
When I move...

407
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
When I'm moving...

408
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I smile brightly.

409
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
That's good, yan-kai-sa.

410
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I was born with a child.

411
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I smile brightly.

412
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
It finally came out.

413
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I smile.

414
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
You smile again.

415
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
But it came out.

416
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Do-ya-sa.

417
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Do-ya-sa.

418
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
It's good, yan-kai-sa.

419
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Really?

420
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I was born with a child.

421
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I...

422
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I smile brightly.

423
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
What's with the smile, yan-kai-sa?

424
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Because I always smile.

425
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I don't understand anything, yan-kai-sa.

426
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Because I always smile.

427
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
It's not good at all, yan-kai-sa.

428
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Why?

429
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
It's not good at all.

430
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
What's with the smile, yan-kai-sa?

431
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
The atmosphere has changed a bit.

432
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
That's why everyone was worried.

433
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
The four teams are Tanaka-san and Shinagawa-san.

434
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
The theme is the Nobel Prize.

435
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Go ahead.

436
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
The Nobel Prize

437
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Hello.

438
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Hello.

439
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Hello.

440
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I'm Gaba-gaba.

441
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I'm a little bit Gaba-gaba.

442
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
The two of us are Enemagura.

443
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
This is the name of the product.

444
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
That's right.

445
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
It's amazing.

446
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Well, the Nobel Prize was amazing last year.

447
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
The Nobel Prize.

448
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Last year, two people won the Nobel Prize.

449
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
One of them was very close up.

450
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Tanaka-san.

451
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Tanaka-san.

452
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
What was the Nobel Prize?

453
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Enemagura.

454
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
That's right.

455
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Enemagura.

456
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
It was a tool to fix ***.

457
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
It made me feel good even if it wasn't ***.

458
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
It's here.

459
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
It's finally here.

460
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,000
The theme is Bob Sapp.

461
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Go ahead.

462
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
It's amazing.

463
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
What are you doing?

464
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
The game of Bob Sapp is about to start.

465
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
It's too late.

466
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
The game of Bob Sapp is about to start.

467
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I'm sorry.

468
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Did I make you wait?

469
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
What were you doing?

470
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
What were you doing?

471
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
The game is about to start.

472
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I was drinking a little bit.

473
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
A little bit.

474
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
A little bit.

475
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
There's no time left for the game of Bob Sapp.

476
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
The game of Bob Sapp is about to start.

477
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
You know Bob Sapp, don't you?

478
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
You know Bob Sapp, don't you?

479
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Bob Sapp.

480
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
You were drinking earlier.

481
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
That's your favorite.

482
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
You open it and drink it.

483
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
It's delicious.

484
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
You know that, don't you?

485
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
What?

486
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
That's Bob Sapp.

487
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
What?

488
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
That's Bob Sapp.

489
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Bob Sapp.

490
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Bob Sapp.

491
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Bob Sapp.

492
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
It's popular with young people.

493
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
They dance at night.

494
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Check it out. Check it out.

495
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Check it out.

496
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Is that hip-hop?

497
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Bob Sapp.

498
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
You're more up-and-up than Bob Sapp.

499
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Thank you very much.

500
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Let's move on to the 6th group.

501
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Miyasako and Komurasaki.

502
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
The theme is hot spring.

503
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Here we go.

504
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I forgot to turn on the other gagol.

505
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I'm sorry.

506
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
But hot spring is...

507
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I have a hot spring here.

508
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Come here.

509
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
What are you looking at?

510
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Stop fighting at the hot spring.

511
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Stop it, Komu.

512
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Stop it, Komu.

513
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
What are you doing?

514
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
I didn't do anything.

515
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Stop fighting at the hot spring.

516
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Stop it.

517
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
You're fighting at the hot spring.

518
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
What are you doing?

519
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
But Hiroya, you're competing with a guy like this.

520
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
I'm good at swimming.

521
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
I'm good at it, too.

522
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
You can't beat me.

523
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
You guys are fast.

524
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
I'm sure I'm fast.

525
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Hurry up and do it.

526
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
I'm fast.

527
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Do it.

528
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Do it.

529
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
All right, it's a match.

530
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Thank you.

531
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I'll do it.

532
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Until the end of the bottle.

533
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Here we go.

534
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
On your mark.

535
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Ready, go!

536
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
I win!

537
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Hot springs are fun, right?

538
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
That's all from Noboribetsu Carlos. Thank you very much.

539
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Thank you very much.

540
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
The 7th place goes to Matsumoto-san and Heipo-san.

541
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
The theme is Yosoji.

542
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
I'm Machan!

543
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
I'm Heipo!

544
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
We are Machan-Po!

545
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
It's about time for us to be in our 40s.

546
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,000
When you're in your 40s, your shoulders start to shake, right?

547
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Yeah, my shoulders don't raise at all.

548
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Sorry, I can't really dance.

549
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
When you're in your 40s, your shoulders don't raise at all.

550
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
My shoulders don't raise at all.

551
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
My shoulders don't raise at all.

552
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
What a shame!

553
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:29,000
What a shame!

554
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
I've been having bad memories lately.

555
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Oh, bad memories? I'm fine with that.

556
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Can you say all the names of your Morning Musume?

557
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
I can say them all.

558
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Tsui-chan, Kago-chan, Milko, Revanna, and Peter Aerts.

559
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Aren't they all K-1 fighters?

560
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Aren't they all K-1 fighters from the middle?

561
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Aren't they all K-1 fighters from the middle?

562
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Aren't they all K-1 fighters from the middle?

563
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Aren't they all K-1 fighters from the middle?

564
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Can you say all the names of them?

565
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
I can say them all.

566
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Kago-chan, Tsui-chan, Milko-chan, Taisei, Tsunku.

567
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Aren't they all Appaku-Nontai?

568
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Aren't they all K-1 fighters?

569
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
They aren't!

570
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,000
They aren't!

571
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Well, well, well, well, well, well, well, when I'm 40, I'll be a gun center.

572
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
I'll be running 10 kilometers every day.

573
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
That's not a big deal.

574
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
When I drive a car, I can only go 10 kilometers per hour.

575
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
I'll be a great gun!

576
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
I'll be a great gun!

577
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
You're singing too much.

578
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
I'll be a great gun!

579
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
I'll be a great gun!

580
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
I'll be a great gun!

581
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
I'll be a great gun!

582
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
I'll be a great gun!

583
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
I'll be a great gun!

584
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
I'll be a great gun!

585
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
I'll be a great gun!

586
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
I'll be a great gun!

587
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Shut up! I'm going to get fired!

588
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
I'm fired!

589
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
I'm fired!

590
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
What did you think, Wano-san?

591
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
It was fun this year, wasn't it?

592
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,000
I hope we get a prize next year.

593
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
I hope so.

594
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
We have to work hard.

595
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
It's not that we're not getting anything in return.

596
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
It would be nice if we could win a prize.

597
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:18,000
If I get a prize, I'll definitely beat him up today.
