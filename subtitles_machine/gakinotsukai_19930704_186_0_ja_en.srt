1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
In the next episode of Gaki no Skyer, we'll be talking about the image change project, I'm Nii-san!

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Well, we said it's the first episode, but we can also think of it as the second episode.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Yamazaki-kun's...

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Yamazaki's, you know, the one where he gets mad at us, the one with the most views.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
This time, it's Jimmy-san.

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Because it's Jimmy-san, it's amazing.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
It's amazing.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I can go over one roof.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Let's introduce him right away.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
This is Jimmy Onishi-san.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Nice to meet you.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Well, it's written here, but I'm Nii-san.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Well, if you think about it, he's really our Nii-san.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
No, we're two months apart.

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Well, this time, it's the image change project.

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
He's back to his original self, Onishi Hideaki.

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
It's an image video.

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I have to show you a strong Jimmy-chan.

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The world is changing, isn't it?

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Of course it's changing.

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
When you're walking down the street, there's a lot of things that people look down on you.

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I was riding a bullet train, and I was hit in the head from above.

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
That kind of thing is gone.

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Why does that happen?

25
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
By doing this project from now on, all of that will be gone.

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Really?

27
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
All of it will be gone.

28
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Let's get rid of it.

29
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Jimmy Onishi is a cutie.

30
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
It's okay to cut it, isn't it?

31
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
That's right.

32
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
That's why it's a video, isn't it?

33
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Yes, that's right.

34
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Oh, it's you, Nijigori-san.

35
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I'm the manager of the Yonyodo factory.

36
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I'm Nijigori-san, in charge of Jimmy Onishi.

37
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
You're always so beautiful.

38
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I often make mistakes when I'm in trouble.

39
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
What kind of work does Rie Mama do?

40
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Well, she's...

41
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Well, Jimmy is...

42
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
She's a cutie.

43
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
She's a cutie.

44
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
At that time, she's the only one I can stop.

45
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Only Rie Mama.

46
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Be careful.

47
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
You're usually doing it, aren't you?

48
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Well, I don't know.

49
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
What the hell are you doing?

50
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Get some juice.

51
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Get more juice.

52
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Stand up.

53
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Everyone, stand up.

54
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Good morning.

55
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Good morning.

56
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Good morning.

57
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Good morning.

58
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Good morning.

59
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Let's go to the bathroom.

60
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
What?

61
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Let's go to the bathroom.

62
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
It looks like a bathroom.

63
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Let's go to the bathroom.

64
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Don't push me.

65
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Hey.

66
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Yes?

67
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I want some udon.

68
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Udon?

69
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Yes.

70
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Go get it yourself.

71
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I don't want udon.

72
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
What's wrong with you?

73
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Hey, let's do it again.

74
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Let's eat.

75
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Ahhhh.

76
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Don't do it again.

77
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Don't do it again.

78
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
What's wrong with you?

79
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
It's your first time.

80
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Let's do it again.

81
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Don't laugh.

82
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Good morning.

83
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Good morning.

84
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Good morning.

85
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Excuse me.

86
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
You're early.

87
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Yes.

88
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
What's wrong with you?

89
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I told you.

90
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I heard it was 6 o'clock.

91
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I saw it on TV.

92
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
What?

93
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I saw it on TV.

94
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
What?

95
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I don't know.

96
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I saw it too.

97
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I didn't laugh.

98
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I'm sorry.

99
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
It was cold.

100
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
There is no vacuum cleaner now.

101
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
There is no vacuum cleaner now.

102
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
There is no vacuum cleaner now.

103
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Hey!

104
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I took this shirt.

105
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
You're small.

106
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
As you are, don't talk too much.

107
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
What is the curtains for?

108
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
You must not speak.

109
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Are you angry with me?

110
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
What's so funny?

111
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Why don't you say something?

112
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
What's so funny?

113
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
What are you doing?

114
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
You look serious.

115
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
If you hit me, I'll grab you.

116
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
What are you doing?

117
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
You're not going to hurt me, are you?

118
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Stand up, you guys.

119
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
There's no one to be a gentleman.

120
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
It doesn't matter.

121
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I'm fine, but you guys are going to lose.

122
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Don't say, please.

123
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I'm not saying anything.

124
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I'm a senior, too.

125
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I'm asking you to get rid of me.

126
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Get rid of me.

127
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
What's going on?

128
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I've been asking you for a while.

129
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Stand up.

130
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Everyone, stand up.

131
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Stand up.

132
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Two months is a thousand and a half years.

133
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
That's right.

134
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I'm a junior.

135
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I'm not going to fight you.

136
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I'm not going to beat you.

137
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
What are you thinking?

138
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I'm waiting.

139
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
You're too stupid.

140
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Sorry.

141
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Go to hell.

142
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Hey, get some juice.

143
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Get some juice.

144
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
No.

145
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Go to Nishimori.

146
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Go to Nishimori.

147
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
No.

148
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Go to Nishimori.

149
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
No.

150
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Go to Nishimori.

151
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Nishimori.

152
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
You're a fool.

153
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
This is a hot spring.

154
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
You know you can't go home.

155
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
You want to go to a hot spring once in a while.

156
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Turn off the heat once in a while.

157
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Why are you hiding behind me?

158
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Get out of here.

159
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
You always turn on the heat.

160
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
That's golf, isn't it?

161
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Why are you playing golf?

162
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
It's cold.

163
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
It's good to go.

164
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
But you have to sell it.

165
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
You're a fool.

166
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
You're too stupid.

167
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Be honest.

168
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
You always turn on the heat.

169
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Why are you hiding behind me?

170
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Sorry.

171
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
What's the matter with you and me?

172
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Don't make fun of me.

173
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Apologize to me.

174
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Hurry up.

175
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Sorry.

176
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I can't stand it anymore.

177
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
What?

178
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I've never been mad at you.

179
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I don't understand.

180
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I'm sorry.

181
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
From today on, the set has changed.

182
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
It's a little more beautiful.

183
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I see.

184
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
It's good.

185
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
But it doesn't cost much.

186
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
It doesn't cost much, but the design is good.

187
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Really?

188
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Issei Miyake.

189
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Don't lie to me.

190
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Don't lie to me.

191
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I'm tired.

192
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I'm tired.

193
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I'm tired.

194
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I'm tired.

195
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I'm tired.

196
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I'm tired.

197
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I'm tired.

198
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I'm tired.

199
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I'm tired.

200
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I'm tired.

201
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
You!

202
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Why didn't you appear at the opening of the game?

203
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
What are you looking at?

204
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
You guys are scary.

205
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I don't know if the brass band will come out.

206
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I usually come out, but I didn't come out on that day.

207
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I don't do that in front of people.

208
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Why are you doing this now?

209
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I feel like we're friends.

210
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
It's the first time.

211
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:35,000
It's the first time, but when I see his face, his family structure, his blood type, it's really good.

212
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Really?

213
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
It's really good.

214
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I have a boyfriend.

215
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I have only one boyfriend.

216
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
How many?

217
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Six siblings.

218
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
It depends on the person.

219
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
You were good just now.

220
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Six siblings?

221
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Six siblings.

222
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Really?

223
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
How many siblings do you have?

224
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Six siblings.

225
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Six siblings?

226
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I'm glad you were born.

227
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I see.

228
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
But you're a beautiful sister.

229
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
When my sister doesn't break, she looks at her underwear.

230
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:17,000
My sister is not very beautiful, but when she doesn't break, she looks at her underwear.

231
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,000
When my sister's siblings are at home,

232
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:31,000
For example, my girlfriend is with her brother, and her brother knows everything.

233
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Everyone knows the man my sister is dating.

234
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I've never seen my sister eating a flower.

235
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
But the husband doesn't know that at all.

236
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I don't know you're looking like this.

237
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I don't know you're looking like this.

238
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
My sister is looking at me in the mirror.

239
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I'm looking at her behind the mirror.

240
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I've never seen it before.

241
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,000
After that, the mirror doesn't move.

242
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I've seen many things about my sister.

243
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I don't want to talk to my sister's boyfriend.

244
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I don't want to talk to my parents.

245
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I don't want to talk to my parents.

246
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I don't want to talk to my parents.

247
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,000
When I was in the second or third year of high school, I smoked a lot at home.

248
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
My husband came to my sister's wedding.

249
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
He gave me a tie.

250
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
He gave me a tie.

251
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
It looks good on you.

252
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
It looks good on you.

253
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
It looks good on you.

254
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
It looks good on you.

255
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I'm sorry, Mr. Ota.

256
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Did you go to your sister's wedding?

257
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
My sister looks like you.

258
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
She looks like you.

259
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
She looks like you.

260
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
She looks like you.

261
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
She looks like you.

262
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
She looks like you.

263
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
It would be better to be on TV.

264
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,000
She's always saying, thank you for everything.

265
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I knew it when I saw her.

266
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I knew it when I saw her.

267
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I knew it when I saw her.

268
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
That's all.

269
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
She's amazing.

270
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I don't know how long she's going to say it.

271
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I don't know how long she's going to say it.

272
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,000
When I came from the other side, I was wondering if she was a barista.

273
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I feel sorry for my family when I see a celebrity.

274
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,400
I don't usually laugh at Nan-chan's sister.

275
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:09,100
I know Nan-chan, and I'm watching her, so I can laugh at her.

276
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:11,100
I can laugh at her.

277
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:15,400
How much do you have in your pocket?

278
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,700
How much do you have?

279
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:20,900
I think I have more than you.

280
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:25,100
I think I have more than you.

281
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:31,500
Even if you say so, I'm a high school student, and I have a name.

282
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,700
I have money.

283
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,900
I have money, too.

284
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:45,300
I'm not proud of it, but I have 50,000 yen.

285
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,800
How much do you have?

286
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,700
I have 50,000 yen, too.

287
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:51,100
You have 50,000 yen, too.

288
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,000
Is that so?

289
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,800
Actually, I have 60,000 yen.

290
00:13:55,800 --> 00:14:05,800
I have 50,000 yen, but I haven't received a dowry yet.

291
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:09,000
You're in the way of taking it home.

292
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,500
Well, that's...

293
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,700
You two can have it.

294
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:14,500
No, you two can have it.

295
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:17,000
I'm so angry that I can't take it.

296
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,500
Why do you have a dowry for a wedding?

297
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,500
Well, it's not decided yet.

298
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:26,400
But you have a lot of dowry.

299
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,200
Why don't you have a dowry?

300
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,100
And you have a lot of dowry.

301
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:32,200
A lot of dowry?

302
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,900
Everyone has a wedding like that, right?

303
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:37,900
Even amateurs give dowry to each other and ask them to go home.

304
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:45,700
You're the only one who has a phone card.

305
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:48,100
What's a phone card?

306
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:52,200
And it's a 50-degree phone card.

307
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:56,400
And it's a 50-degree phone card.

308
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,200
I don't need it.

309
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,700
It's winter.

310
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:01,300
Can't you see it?

311
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:05,300
No, I have a ring on my nose.

312
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:09,600
I'm not proud of you, but I have 100,000 yen in my pocket.

313
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,400
Are you serious?

314
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:17,200
You have a phone card and a ring on your nose with 100,000 yen.

315
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:21,600
You're so cool.

316
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:27,100
If you have a phone card, you can use a normal phone card.

317
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:30,700
You two are a stupid couple.

318
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:33,100
If you have a phone card, you can use a normal phone card.

319
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:38,900
If you have a phone card, you can use a normal phone card.

320
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:44,800
If you take it, you can't go home.

321
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:50,000
If you take it, you can't go home.

322
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,100
I don't know if it's because you're called P-chan, but if you take it, you can't go home.

323
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:59,200
You don't look like a normal guy.

324
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:07,300
I thought I'd have to hit him once.

325
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:11,000
You're a bad guy.

326
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,800
I don't want to see you in a suit.

327
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,700
I know.

328
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,500
I don't care about that.

329
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:23,000
I'll look at your feet and you'll see a silver high heel.

330
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:30,500
I'll look at your feet and you'll see a silver high heel.

331
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,900
Hey!

332
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,800
Hey!

333
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:35,600
Hamada!

334
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,200
Hey, Shimoda!

335
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,700
What's that?

336
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:47,400
He's ignoring me.

337
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,600
Hey!

338
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:56,800
What are you doing?

339
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:03,100
Today, I had a high heel and my body hurt.

340
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:05,500
Well, that's the result.

341
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,500
Well, if you look at the picture.

342
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:15,300
What should I do when I take a picture of my passport?

343
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,700
Just leave it as it is.

344
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:18,000
What do you mean?

345
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,300
Just leave it as it is.

346
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:22,100
That's no good.

347
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:23,100
Why?

348
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:27,000
That's going to be a disguise.

349
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,300
That's not going to change.

350
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:30,700
That's not going to change.

351
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:33,900
Shut up!

352
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:39,200
You know what happens when you take a picture of your passport, don't you?

353
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,400
When you sit down, you go like this.

354
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:46,600
When you're taking a picture, you go like this.

355
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:49,200
You don't have time for that when you take a picture of your passport.

356
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,400
That's why I'm going to change my passport next month.

357
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:54,600
I can't wear a high heel when that happens, can I?

358
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:59,300
You can't, can you?

359
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:02,300
If that's the case, I'll wear a high heel.

360
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:05,500
If that's the case, I'll wear a high heel.

361
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:09,900
But you don't have to take a picture of your passport.

362
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:14,500
People who wear high heels are in some way worried.

363
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,500
That's true, but...

364
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,300
They wear high heels to hide it.

365
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:18,000
That's right.

366
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,600
And then, for example, if you have a nose injury,

367
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,800
and you have an accident, and you don't like it,

368
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:28,100
and you're wearing nose glasses, that's not good.

369
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:30,300
That's not good.

370
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:34,000
As a human being, as a human being,

371
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,000
a man who shouldn't be on the field should wear nose glasses.

372
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,300
Should he go out?

373
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:41,600
Even among those who wear high heels,

374
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,400
some women think they don't know,

375
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,600
and some women hide it.

376
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,200
No.

377
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,700
No?

378
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:49,800
How can you say that?

379
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:55,800
You!

380
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,000
You!

381
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,100
You're worse than my head!

382
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:03,200
Idiot!

383
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:03,800
Is that true?

384
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:04,800
It's true.

385
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:07,500
My wife knows it's hard.

386
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:11,300
But she doesn't take it off in front of her.

387
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:15,800
Are there any women in Japan who don't realize it?

388
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:16,800
No, there aren't.

389
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,400
Of course there aren't.

390
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,500
I wonder if there are.

391
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,500
There aren't.

392
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,200
I wonder if there are.

393
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,500
No matter how you think about it, you can't tell.

394
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:26,500
I shot a commercial.

395
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,800
I shot a commercial.

396
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:32,000
I had to make my child ride a stroller.

397
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,200
Children can easily hold their heads like this.

398
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:40,000
I didn't do that, but if it was me,

399
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,800
if my hand didn't come this close,

400
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:44,100
I would have done this.

401
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,400
But children...

402
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,000
Children can't do anything.

403
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,300
They don't have a stroller.

404
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:50,300
It's dangerous.

405
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:52,800
You have to hold it somewhere.

406
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:55,200
Hold it like this.

407
00:19:55,200 --> 00:20:02,200
It's not stable, so hold it like this.

408
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,600
That person did the same thing.

409
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:08,200
She passed away, but she did this.

410
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,000
Oh, really?

411
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,100
She told me to knock before entering the teacher's room.

412
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:14,200
She told you to knock before entering the teacher's room?

413
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,700
That's terrible!

414
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:17,400
The teacher was in the room at that time.

415
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,400
I wonder if she was exposed.

416
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,000
I wonder if she was in the room at that time.

417
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:21,700
Yes.

418
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:26,500
The teacher had a mannequin on her neck, right?

419
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,200
Oh, Zurakamon-sensei?

420
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,900
She rode on it and wrote,

421
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:34,700
〇〇.

422
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:35,800
Konkon!

423
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,300
Yes.

424
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:40,300
It's a beret of this.

425
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:43,500
The teacher...

426
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,900
There were a few of them, right?

427
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:49,900
When the teacher was going somewhere,

428
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:52,200
the assistant was cleaning the room.

429
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:57,000
The teacher was going somewhere, but she was sitting on the desk.

430
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,600
Teacher?

431
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,300
Teacher?

432
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:03,200
Don't ask!

433
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,900
Answer me!

434
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:11,100
The assistant was sitting like this.

435
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:15,100
You'll get in trouble.

436
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,900
There are a lot of people in the entertainment world.

437
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:26,800
There are a lot of people in the entertainment world.

438
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,700
Also,

439
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:32,200
there are people who quit recently, right?

440
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:35,400
Oh, really?

441
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,700
Is that possible?

442
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:40,500
But it wasn't that big a shift from before.

443
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:43,500
It was a partial shift.

444
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:57,700
〇〇.

445
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:00,900
When the makeup artist was fixing her makeup,

446
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:00,900
she said,

447
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:05,100
〇〇.

448
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:07,100
No, really.

449
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:08,100
No, really.

450
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:10,800
No, really.

451
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,400
Who else is there?

452
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:16,300
There are a lot of people.

453
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:46,100
〇〇.
