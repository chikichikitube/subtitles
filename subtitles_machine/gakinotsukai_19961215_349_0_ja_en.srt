00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Okamoto's funny or not funny quiz!

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Mr. Okamoto, you were rescued by a cat, right?

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
What about you, Mr. Okamoto?

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
It seems so.

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I don't know myself.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Funny or not funny.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I see.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
It's out of tune.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Especially recently.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Out of tune?

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Very out of tune.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Out of tune?

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Out of tune.

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Downtown out of tune.

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Now, let's start with downtown.

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I'll check everyone's funny or not funny.

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I see.

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Okamoto has absolute confidence in his comedy.

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
His sense is more than downtown.

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
This time, he'll use his junior, Isomata, to check out Hamada Matsumoto's sense of humor.

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
This program is brought to you by these sponsors.

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Okamoto's funny or not funny quiz part 1

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Look at this.

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Is it starting already?

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
It's starting already.

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Don't let your guard down.

27
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
What's your problem?

28
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
What's your problem?

29
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
What's your problem?

30
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
What's your problem?

31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
That's right.

32
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I'm a strange old man.

33
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I'm a strange old man.

34
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
It's out of tune.

35
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
What's this?

36
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
It's not funny.

37
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I'm sorry.

38
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I don't think it's funny.

39
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I can't help but laugh because it's funny.

40
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
It's not funny.

41
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
It's out of tune.

42
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I don't think it's funny.

43
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
It's out of tune.

44
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
It's funny now.

45
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Isomata is funny now?

46
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
If you don't tell me it's funny, I can't help it.

47
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
It's out of tune.

48
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
It's out of tune.

49
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
You guys have a lot of complaints.

50
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I'm really sorry.

51
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
You take too much time off.

52
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I'll tell you the truth.

53
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I'm counting on you.

54
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
You take too much time off.

55
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
If you notice it.

56
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
You don't tell me anything.

57
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
It's scary that there's no one to tell me.

58
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I'm a strange old man.

59
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
It's not funny.

60
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I'm a strange old man.

61
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
It's out of tune.

62
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I'm a strange old man.

63
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I don't know.

64
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I don't know.

65
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I'm kind of a weird old man.

66
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Don't you want to go home?

67
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I see.

68
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Then, I'll go home.

69
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I like the first half.

70
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Don't you feel bad because it's too long?

71
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
It's the same.

72
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
The first half was good.

73
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
The second half was too much.

74
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
It's incorrect.

75
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
What?

76
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
It's incorrect?

77
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
What is it?

78
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Yamazaki.

79
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I don't know this.

80
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I don't know either.

81
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I see.

82
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I don't know either.

83
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
He doesn't sleep.

84
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
He works like a horse.

85
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
He doesn't sleep.

86
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
He works a lot.

87
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
The last one.

88
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Yes.

89
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Meow.

90
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Meow.

91
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Meow.

92
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Meow.

93
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Meow.

94
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Meow.

95
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Meow.

96
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Meow.

97
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Meow.

98
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Meow.

99
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Meow.

100
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
How was it?

101
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Was it interesting or not?

102
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Was it interesting?

103
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
It wasn't interesting.

104
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I'm sorry.

105
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I don't know.

106
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
What he does is interesting.

107
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
It's interesting.

108
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Including the staff.

109
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Okamoto, who was worried about the sense of downtown, continued to ask more difficult questions.

110
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Okamoto, interesting or not?

111
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Check part 2.

112
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
First of all, this.

113
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Tell me it's a matter.

114
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Stop it.

115
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Stop it.

116
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Stop it.

117
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Stop it.

118
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Stop it.

119
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I was surprised.

120
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
This is interesting.

121
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I was surprised.

122
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
This is interesting.

123
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
This is interesting.

124
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
It's like a woman eating her teeth.

125
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Next.

126
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Do you love me?

127
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
No.

128
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Do you love me?

129
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
No, I don't.

130
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Do you love me?

131
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
No.

132
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Do you love me?

133
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
No.

134
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Do you love me?

135
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
No.

136
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
This is also interesting.

137
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Naturally.

138
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
It's also interesting.

139
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I'm not a funny guy.

140
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I'm a funny guy.

141
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I'm a funny guy.

142
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I think the woman is funny.

143
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
That's it.

144
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I thought that would be funny.

145
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
It's a little off.

146
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I think so.

147
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I don't want to write on the bulletin board.

148
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
That's funny.

149
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
The last one.

150
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
The last one?

151
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
No.

152
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I love you.

153
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I love you too much.

154
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I love you too much.

155
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I love you.

156
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I love you too.

157
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I love you.

158
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I love you too much.

159
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I love you.

160
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I love you too.

161
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I love you.

162
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
It doesn't work.

163
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I love you.

164
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I love you.

165
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I'm sorry.

166
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
It was fun.

167
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
It was fun.

168
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Did you get it?

169
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I'm sorry.

170
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
What?

171
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
What is good?

172
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
That...

173
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I can't do it.

174
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Take a break.

175
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Take a break.

176
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Take a break.

177
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Take a break.

178
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I can't do it.

179
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I'm sorry.

180
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Go home.

181
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I said go home.

182
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Go home.

183
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I'm sorry.

184
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I can't do it.

185
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Go home.

186
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
You're back.

187
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Why don't you go home and change your manager?

188
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
The audience is close.

189
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Right?

190
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
There's a big difference between when the audience is cheerful and when they're not.

191
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
What do you think about today?

192
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
We're in a bad mood.

193
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
We're in a bad mood.

194
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
We're in a bad mood.

195
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Yes, what is it?

196
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
When I came down here earlier,

197
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I thought I'd go to the bathroom.

198
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I asked if it was okay to go to the bathroom now.

199
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
My manager said,

200
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
It's okay because you're not here.

201
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
That's not what I meant.

202
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I don't want to go to the bathroom again.

203
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I don't want to go to the bathroom again.

204
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I don't want to go to the bathroom again.

205
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
That's how it is.

206
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Hana-chan.

207
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
What is it?

208
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Hana-chan, this is...

209
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
What is it?

210
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
There's green onions stuck in my teeth.

211
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
It's terrible.

212
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Take it off.

213
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
No, no, no.

214
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I'm going all the way to the end.

215
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I can't take it off.

216
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I've already eaten green onions stuck in my teeth.

217
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
There's a lot of cicadas in there.

218
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Wait a minute.

219
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
It's really amazing, so you should take it off.

220
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
It's all green.

221
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I don't have teeth like this.

222
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
It's not.

223
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
There's a lot of green onions in there.

224
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I don't know if it's green or not.

225
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
It's hard.

226
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
What is it?

227
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I don't know.

228
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Bring me a mirror.

229
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
It's all green, so you should take it off.

230
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
It's definitely a lie.

231
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
It's true.

232
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
No, no, no.

233
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
This is...

234
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
It's a fairy tale.

235
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
That's where we meet.

236
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
We don't talk in the dressing room.

237
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
No, no, no.

238
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
You can't do that.

239
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
What kind of mirror is that?

240
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
It's a mirror for makeup.

241
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
This is my own work.

242
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
What kind of mirror is that?

243
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
It's my own work.

244
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I can't see the upper teeth even if I talk.

245
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Basically, I've already taken it off.

246
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
You've already taken it off?

247
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
How many times have you taken it off?

248
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
It's blue.

249
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Oh, I saw it a little.

250
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Why am I so nervous?

251
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
That's how it is.

252
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I'm always sleepy.

253
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
That's what I think.

254
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Tokyo is...

255
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
What is this?

256
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
There's a lot of crows.

257
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
There's a lot of trash in the neighborhood.

258
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
There's a lot of trash near the bar.

259
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Why am I near the bar?

260
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I live near the bar.

261
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Why am I near the bar?

262
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I live on the second floor and play the trumpet.

263
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Did you bring it?

264
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
No, no, no.

265
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
What is it?

266
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Osaka is...

267
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Wait a minute.

268
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Wait a minute.

269
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
What is it?

270
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
What is it?

271
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
What?

272
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
You took it off.

273
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
What are the boots?

274
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
It's the worst.

275
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
There are no crows in Osaka.

276
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I've never seen it.

277
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
It's definitely the fourth floor.

278
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
That's what makes me angry.

279
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
When I play the trumpet,

280
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Ah!

281
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Ah!

282
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Ah!

283
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
No, no, no.

284
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
That's not true.

285
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
That's not true.

286
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
It's definitely the fourth floor.

287
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
It's definitely the fourth floor.

288
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I won't drop it on the fourth floor.

289
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
It's nice.

290
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Like you.

291
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
It's Hollywood.

292
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Why?

293
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Hollywood?

294
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
It's not Hollywood.

295
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
It's Japan.

296
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
It's not Beverly Hills.

297
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Not at all.

298
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
No, it's definitely Beverly Hills.

299
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Why?

300
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Because, you know,

301
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
when a celebrity has a family,

302
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
it changes a lot.

303
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Even Higa Shino's daughter

304
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
goes to an American school.

305
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I can't think of that.

306
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
That's your parents' way of thinking.

307
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
That's your parents' way of thinking.

308
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Daddy!

309
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
That's what they say.

310
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I'll beat you up.

311
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
You're the one who says that.

312
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
You're the one who says that.

313
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
If you have children,

314
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
you'll understand.

315
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
No, that's not true.

316
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
No, that's not true.

317
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
It's very strict.

318
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I don't understand that.

319
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
If you have children,

320
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
you'll always have a paper knife.

321
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
You can't do that.

322
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
That's not true.

323
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
That's not true.

324
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
That's not true.

325
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
It's not that bad.

326
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
It's not that bad.

327
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
It's not that bad.

328
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
It's not that bad.

329
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
In the end,

330
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
if you care about your children,

331
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
your parents...

332
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
your parents...

333
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
they don't care about you.

334
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
That's right.

335
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
If you look at their eyes,

336
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
you'll understand.

337
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Your eyes are dead.

338
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Your eyes are dead.

339
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
They don't care about you.

340
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
At that time,

341
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
your father didn't care about you.

342
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
That's not true.

343
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
That's not true.

344
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
That's not true.

345
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
That's not true.

346
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
That's not true.

347
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Well...

348
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
You can say that.

349
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Can you say that?

350
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
You were brought up like a child.

351
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
That's not true.

352
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
That's what everyone thinks.

353
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
You were raised in love, right?

354
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I was raised.

355
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Your father was a bit strange too.

356
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Your father was a bit strange too.

357
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
You're really overreacting.

358
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
There's nothing wrong with that.

359
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I wasn't a good father, right?

360
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
You weren't a good father?

361
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
No way!

362
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Why are you lying?

363
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I wasn't a good father, right?

364
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
You weren't a good father?

365
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I always wore a kimono with a UZUMAKI pattern.

366
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Why?!

367
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
You were wearing a obi-kone.

368
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I was wearing a obi-kone with a UZUMAKI pattern on my cheeks.

369
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Right?

370
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
That's funny.

371
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
That's the opposite.

372
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
For example, if you did that, I would do the same.

373
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
That's fine, but...

374
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
We started with the story about Higashino.

375
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
That's right. Everyone is like that.

376
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:02,000
They're going to Hawaii this New Year, right?

377
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
That's right.

378
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
They're going to Hawaii this New Year, right?

379
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
That's right.

380
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:12,000
They're going to Higashino with their families, right?

381
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
It doesn't matter!

382
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Everyone really likes to go abroad, right?

383
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
It's cold.

384
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
It's cold.

385
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I want to go somewhere warm.

386
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
For example, if I do that for a week or two.

387
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
You can't do that?

388
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
It's cold.

389
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
It's cold.

390
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
It's cold.

391
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
It's cold.

392
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
It's cold.

393
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
It's cold.

394
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
It's cold.

395
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
It's cold.

396
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
It's cold.

397
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
It's cold.

398
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
It's cold.

399
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Just like when you wake up in the morning,

400
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
you're like a timer.

401
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
You're like a timer.

402
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
What?

403
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
What?

404
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
You're like a timer.

405
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
You're like a timer.

406
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Don't exaggerate it!

407
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Everyone is like that.

408
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Everyone is like that.

409
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Everyone is like that.

410
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I don't know.

411
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I don't know.

412
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Everyone knows.

413
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:07,000
And if you ask me where I'm going, I'll say Hyakka-tei.

414
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
You're a poor man.

415
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Why? I don't feel cold at all.

416
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
That's not true.

417
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I'll go to the toilet. The toilet seat is warm.

418
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
That's not true.

419
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
There's nothing cold about it.

420
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:32,000
If you ask me, the toilet seat is Hawaii. It's the same as Wai-kiki.

421
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
The flow is the same as Wai-kiki.

422
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
It's Honolulu.

423
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
What the hell?

424
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Which would you like to compare it to?

425
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
It's the same, right?

426
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
What's so interesting about it?

427
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,000
What's so interesting about Hawaii? Tell me.

428
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:57,000
The beach? Do you run on the beach like this?

429
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
This is the most interesting part.

430
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Like this?

431
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
That's enough.

432
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Like this?

433
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Like this?

434
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Okay, I got it.

435
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Like this?

436
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Like this?

437
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Like this?

438
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,000
It's fun when you can see this part.

439
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Where is it?

440
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:30,000
This is from the entertainer Mohan Matsumoto.

441
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
This is my eldest son, Koichi.

442
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I can't wake up early. What should I do?

443
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,000
It's an impact.

444
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
What?

445
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I put cutlet in my body.

446
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Cutlet.

447
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I put a surprising cutlet in my body.

448
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Do you understand?

449
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
If you put that in, you can't wake up every day.

450
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
That's right.

451
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
That's right.

452
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
For example, I'm sleeping and I wake up.

453
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I'm still in a daze.

454
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
My body is also in a daze.

455
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
I think he's going to brush his teeth.

456
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
He's got a body.

457
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
He's got a body.

458
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
He's got a body.

459
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I'm surprised.

460
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:18,000
My body is like grilled meat.

461
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
It's like a body.

462
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
From the morning.

463
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I've had a hard time since the morning.

464
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I'm surprised.

465
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
And it has nothing to do with you not being able to wake up in the morning.

466
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Why?

467
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I'm not telling you how to wake up.

468
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
That's right.

469
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,000
What you're doing is what you do after you wake up.

470
00:19:41,000 --> 00:20:08,000
How do you wake him up?
