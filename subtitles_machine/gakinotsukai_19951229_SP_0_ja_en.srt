1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Special in Hong Kong

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
It's special, isn't it?

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Yes, it is.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Two hours?

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Yes, 7 and 9.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
7 and 9.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
They say you can do anything if you can do 7 and 9.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Oh, on TV?

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
No.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
On the whole.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Oh, on the whole?

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I don't know the whole.

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
What about Jimmy?

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I don't know.

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm not busy.

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Are there any other guests?

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I don't have any guests.

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Me and you?

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
No.

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I've never heard of it.

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
It's called special.

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
It's two hours.

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
It would be nice if it was just the two of us.

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
If it was just the two of us, it would be...

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
It would be a minus.

26
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
It would be a minus.

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
It would be a minus.

28
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
But if we do it together, it would be a plus.

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
What can we do with two people?

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
We're doing a lot of things.

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
We're doing a lot of things.

32
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
What do you mean?

33
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
From comedy to comedy.

34
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Let's do comedy.

35
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Shall we do comedy?

36
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm Sakata-chan.

37
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I'm Rin-chan.

38
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I'm Yama-chan.

39
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I'm Jimmy-chan.

40
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Together, we are Jimmy-Yama.

41
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
We've been friends for a long time.

42
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
We've been friends for a long time.

43
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
We're really close friends.

44
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
You know what I'm thinking.

45
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I know.

46
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I know what Jimmy-chan is thinking.

47
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Yama is like this.

48
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
That's great.

49
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Two is like this.

50
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Two.

51
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Yama-chan, try it.

52
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
It's New Year's Day.

53
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I'll do it.

54
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Put a thread on it.

55
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Octopus, octopus, rise.

56
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Rise to the sky.

57
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
You have to do it properly.

58
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
You have to do it properly.

59
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Stop it.

60
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
This is funny.

61
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
It's a waste of time.

62
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
This is a special.

63
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Two hours.

64
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Seven o'clock.

65
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
What's that?

66
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
What's that?

67
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Do it properly.

68
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I've been doing this for two hours.

69
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
That's enough.

70
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Stop it.

71
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Why are you doing that?

72
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Excuse me.

73
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
What are you doing?

74
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Mr. Okamoto is calling me.

75
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I'm pretty angry.

76
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
That's not the problem.

77
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I'm calling you because it's a special.

78
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I can't deal with the manager of the first floor.

79
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Manager Okamoto Akihiko

80
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I don't know when that happened.

81
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:22,000
A young man started his life as a manager of downtown.

82
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
His character started to run wild and one day he was cut off from the world.

83
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
What are you doing?

84
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Are you angry?

85
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
All of us?

86
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Yes, the cast and the staff.

87
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Why are you angry?

88
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Why are you angry with me?

89
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I don't know.

90
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I don't want to do it.

91
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Start.

92
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Manager Okamoto couldn't stop anyone.

93
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
He followed the escalator and went crazy.

94
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
He developed his own scary challenge.

95
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Are you going to arrest me?

96
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I'll do it.

97
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:09,000
What does God want from him?

98
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I'm going to Okinawa.

99
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I'm going to Okinawa.

100
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I can't do this.

101
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
The devil's plan was spread out in Okinawa.

102
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I'm going to cut the watermelon.

103
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
You're going to cut the watermelon with this.

104
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
What are you doing?

105
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
The ideal girl is too big.

106
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
You're so cool.

107
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,000
And now he's cut off again.

108
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Where are you going?

109
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Where are you calling me?

110
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Hong Kong.

111
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
You'll know if you come to the airport in Hong Kong.

112
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
You'll know if you come to the airport in Hong Kong.

113
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
You'll know if you come to the airport in Hong Kong.

114
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
You'll know if you come to the airport in Hong Kong.

115
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
You'll know if you come to the airport in Hong Kong.

116
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
And now he's going to Hong Kong.

117
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Matsumoto Hamada's grand adventure in Hong Kong begins now.

118
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Hong Kong.

119
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
This country is full of unusual activities.

120
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Various people, food, and goods are overflowing.

121
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
The mysterious atmosphere is overflowing.

122
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
What will be waiting for them?

123
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
The boy's first trip to Hong Kong is about to begin.

124
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
It's very far from here.

125
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
This is not Japan.

126
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
You're high.

127
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
It's been a year.

128
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
It's been a year.

129
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
It's been a year.

130
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
What are you doing?

131
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Good job.

132
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Good job.

133
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
What do you mean good job?

134
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
You finally came to me.

135
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I've been waiting for a long time.

136
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
What is it?

137
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Hong Kong.

138
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Hong Kong.

139
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Hong Kong.

140
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
You'll know if you come to the airport in Hong Kong.

141
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
What are you doing?

142
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Stop it.

143
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
What are you doing?

144
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
It took four hours by plane.

145
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
You can't do that in Japan.

146
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
You're high.

147
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
What are you doing?

148
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
You're high.

149
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
You can't fly.

150
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
You're not flying.

151
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Which way are you flying?

152
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I'm flying.

153
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Mr. Okamoto, you're high.

154
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
What are you doing?

155
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
It's my show.

156
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
It's your show.

157
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
It's my show.

158
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Stop fighting.

159
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Let's go.

160
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I'm gonna go to the mountain

161
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
What are you talking about?

162
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Why did you come to Hong Kong?

163
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Because I want to

164
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Don't say that on TV

165
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Are you stupid?

166
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I'm going to Maesan Road

167
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,000
That's a pass

168
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Excuse me

169
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Cat

170
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Excuse me

171
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Are you stupid?

172
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I don't know if you're stupid

173
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,000
You're wearing the pants we were talking about

174
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I don't know if it's a tie

175
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
It's the pants we were talking about

176
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
What happened to your pants?

177
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I don't want to see my pants from here

178
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
What are you talking about?

179
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Brief

180
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I don't know

181
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I don't want to see my briefs like this

182
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I've been walking like this all the time

183
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I don't want to see my briefs like this

184
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I can't wear this

185
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I can't wear this

186
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Excuse me

187
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I can't smoke here

188
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
It's dirty

189
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Don't say that

190
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I don't want to see my briefs

191
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I don't want to see my briefs

192
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Don't say that

193
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
What kind of country is this?

194
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
It's a mess

195
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,000
The second floor of the bank is like this

196
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I'm scared

197
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Let's eat this

198
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:16,000
This is Hong Kong

199
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I wanted to eat Hong Kong-style food

200
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I don't want to be full

201
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I don't want to be full

202
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I don't want to be full

203
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
What are you talking about?

204
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
He's happy

205
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I don't want to be full

206
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Are you an idiot?

207
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Do you have chicken nuggets?

208
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I don't know

209
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Ohama-san, let's go for a walk

210
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Let's go for a walk

211
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
How about going this way?

212
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Let's go for a walk in Hong Kong

213
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I don't want to go

214
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Matsumoto Hamada has finally landed in Hong Kong

215
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
It's going to be a difficult journey

216
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I'm on Neyzan Road

217
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Neyzan Road

218
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Hong Kong's main street is crowded with people and shops

219
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I'm scared of signs

220
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
That's funny

221
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,000
That's funny

222
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
It's different

223
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
It's the opposite

224
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:54,000
It's the worst

225
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
It's not funny

226
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Don't say it's not funny

227
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
If you say it's not funny, everyone will laugh

228
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
You said it's not funny

229
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
If you say it's not funny, everyone will laugh

230
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
What are you doing?

231
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Stop it

232
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Stop it

233
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I'm going to kill you

234
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Don't fight

235
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Hey

236
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I only brought one pose

237
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
What is one pose?

238
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Look at him

239
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
He's wearing a mask

240
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:52,000
What are you doing?

241
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Everyone is laughing

242
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Stop it

243
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
You have to be strong

244
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I can't adjust

245
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
You can't be like this

246
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
That's right

247
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
It's your fault

248
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Stop it

249
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Stop hitting me

250
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
What?

251
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Stop it

252
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Stop it

253
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Stop it

254
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
It's your fault

255
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Stop it

256
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I'm going to die

257
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I'm going to die

258
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I'm going to die

259
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Why am I going to die?

260
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Why am I going to die?

261
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
The trip to Hong Kong is called by the manager, Hokamoto

262
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,000
They finally arrive at their first destination

263
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:10,000
We're here

264
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
What are you doing?

265
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I want to show you something

266
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
What?

267
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Hokamoto's Happening New Year

268
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
What?

269
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Hokamoto's Happening New Year

270
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Hokamoto's Happening New Year

271
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
This is going to be popular

272
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
It's going to be

273
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I'm going to do it now

274
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Let's enjoy the night in Hong Kong

275
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
They go to the roof of the building

276
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I'm going to do it now

277
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
You'll know when you see it

278
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
What is this?

279
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Hokamoto's Happening New Year

280
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
It's going to be popular

281
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Really?

282
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
It's not going to be popular if you don't see it

283
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
It's going to be popular

284
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I'll do it with the light

285
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
It's messed up

286
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
You can't mess it up

287
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I'm going to do it now

288
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Go over there

289
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Hong Kong

290
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
It's better to do it in the back

291
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
The location

292
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
This one?

293
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
It's here

294
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Tell me when you get there

295
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I do that sometimes

296
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,500
Don't say that!

297
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,500
Say it properly!

298
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,500
Yes, I will.

299
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,500
Let's go.

300
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,500
The title is...

301
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,500
AOKAMOTO HAPPENING!

302
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,500
Here we are!

303
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,500
Touch it!

304
00:14:49,500 --> 00:15:01,500
AOKAMOTO HAPPENING!

305
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:27,500
AOKAMOTO HAPPENING!

306
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,500
You did a great job!

307
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:42,500
It looks like a flower is falling.

308
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,500
You did a great job!

309
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:49,500
I'm taking off my slippers.

310
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,500
You did a great job!

311
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,500
You did a great job!

312
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,500
It's beautiful!

313
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,500
You did a great job!

314
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,500
Let's go.

315
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,500
Why are you so pale?

316
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:05,500
I don't want to get off here.

317
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:13,500
They are taken to the best restaurant in Hong Kong.

318
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:17,500
Let's have a toast and eat what you like.

319
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:21,500
Cheers!

320
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:24,500
It's my first time.

321
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:27,500
Please enjoy the food.

322
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:40,500
AOKAMOTO HAPPENING!

323
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,500
I don't want to drink anymore.

324
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,500
Are you serious?

325
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,500
What are you doing?

326
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,500
Go home!

327
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,500
Can I go home now?

328
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,500
You can go home.

329
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:01,500
You can go home now.

330
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:04,500
We will do our best.

331
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,500
We are very young.

332
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:09,500
What is your way of thinking?

333
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:12,500
It's rare these days.

334
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,500
I feel bad.

335
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:28,500
Don't say that you feel bad coming to Hong Kong.

336
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:32,500
I don't want to go home.

337
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,500
I can't lose.

338
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,500
Thank you.

339
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:39,500
I don't want to drink anymore.

340
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:42,500
I don't want to drink anymore.

341
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,500
What's the problem?

342
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,500
I don't want to drink anymore.

343
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:51,500
What are you going to do with the ketchup?

344
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:54,500
I will wash my hands.

345
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:57,500
I will wash my hands.

346
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,500
You don't have to do that.

347
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,500
You don't have to do that.

348
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,500
It's so delicious.

349
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,500
It's delicious.

350
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:11,500
You should eat 5 pieces.

351
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,500
It's delicious.

352
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,500
I don't want to eat anymore.

353
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,500
You should eat 5 pieces.

354
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:21,500
I'm worried about you.

355
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,500
I eat 5 pieces.

356
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,500
You will be hungry at night.

357
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:28,500
You will be hungry at night.

358
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,500
I eat 4 pieces.

359
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:33,500
Please eat 4 pieces.

360
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,500
Please eat 4 pieces.

361
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:39,500
I will eat 6 pieces.

362
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:43,500
I can't eat anymore.

363
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:46,500
Why?

364
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,500
This is the main dish today.

365
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,500
This is the main dish today.

366
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:57,500
This is the main dish today.

367
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:03,500
This is the most expensive dish in Hong Kong.

368
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:08,500
This is the most expensive dish in Hong Kong.

369
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:12,500
This is the most expensive dish in Hong Kong.

370
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:18,500
This is the most expensive dish in Hong Kong.

371
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:23,500
You eat almost all of this.

372
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,500
You eat almost all of this.

373
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:38,500
You eat almost all of this.

374
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:43,500
This is like a broadcast ban.

375
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:46,500
This is like a broadcast ban.

376
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:52,500
You should eat this dish.

377
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:56,500
You should eat this dish.

378
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,500
You have changed.

379
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,500
You have changed.

380
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:03,500
You have changed.

381
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,500
You have changed.

382
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,500
You are surprised.

383
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,500
You are surprised.

384
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:27,500
I can't eat it all at once.

385
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:36,500
I can't eat it all at once.

386
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:39,500
I can only eat it like this.

387
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:43,500
I can only eat it like this.

388
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:46,500
This is a great dish, isn't it?

389
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:49,500
Since we're at a good restaurant, I can't ask you to look at it.

390
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,500
I'd like you to get on the boat and say,

391
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,500
I can't do it.

392
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,500
Absolutely.

393
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,500
If I say it again, will you tell me?

394
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,500
Of course.

395
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,500
Mr. Okamoto, you're late.

396
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,500
You're late.

397
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,500
Come and look at it.

398
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,500
I'll be back.

399
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:11,500
The tempo is bad.

400
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,500
When did you say that?

401
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,500
When did you say that?

402
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,500
He didn't say anything.

403
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,500
Did you go somewhere, Okamoto?

404
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,500
Come and look at it.

405
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,500
Yes.

406
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,500
I don't know what you're talking about.

407
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,500
You're too fast.

408
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,500
I'm sorry about the meal.

409
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,500
Mr. Okamoto is angry again.

410
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,500
He's calling me.

411
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,500
I'm sorry.

412
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,500
Why?

413
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,500
I'm sorry.

414
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,500
We've been eating together for a while.

415
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,500
He called me and told me to bring it right away.

416
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,500
Mr. Okamoto left.

417
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,500
Where did he go?

418
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,500
I'm sorry.

419
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,500
You're in a good mood.

420
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,500
Did anyone say anything?

421
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,500
No.

422
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,500
It's only natural for Jimmy to be angry.

423
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,500
That's right.

424
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:11,500
He goes to the place that Okamoto has designated.

425
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:15,500
He's going to be fired if he goes to Japan.

426
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,500
That's a good thing.

427
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:21,500
I don't think he can manage it.

428
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,500
He's the only one.

429
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:27,500
He's doing his best for himself.

430
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:31,500
He wasn't like that when we first arrived.

431
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,500
He wasn't like that at all.

432
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,500
He was a good boy.

433
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,500
He was a good boy.

434
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:41,500
He couldn't do anything.

435
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,500
When did he start to behave like that?

436
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,500
He started to behave like that.

437
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:49,500
He started to behave like that when he said he picked up a kitten.

438
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,500
I knew it.

439
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:57,500
He started to behave like that when he said he didn't need clothes.

440
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,500
He said it was warm when he saw a kitten.

441
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,500
It's obviously strange.

442
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,500
Obviously.

443
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:08,500
Are we there yet?

444
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:09,500
We're almost there.

445
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:10,500
We're almost there?

446
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,500
We're on top of the mountain.

447
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,500
We're on top of the observatory.

448
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:15,500
Observatory.

449
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,500
We're on top of the observatory.

450
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:22,500
Okamoto is waiting for Takadai to see the night view of Hong Kong worth 1 million dollars.

451
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:25,500
What's going to happen?

452
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:28,500
This way, please.

453
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,500
I don't understand.

454
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,500
What's wrong with you?

455
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,500
I'm going to kill you.

456
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,500
Why are you going to kill me?

457
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:44,500
I want to eat noodles.

458
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,500
Why don't you come back to the hotel?

459
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,500
Look at this.

460
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:51,500
The night view is beautiful.

461
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,500
It's beautiful.

462
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,500
Why is it beautiful?

463
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,500
What?

464
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,500
Why is it beautiful?

465
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:02,500
I don't understand why you're angry.

466
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:03,500
Why?

467
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,500
Is it beautiful?

468
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:07,500
It's beautiful.

469
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:08,500
Why is it beautiful?

470
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:10,500
I'll show you.

471
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,500
The real night view.

472
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,500
What is this?

473
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,500
It's cool.

474
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,500
It's cool.

475
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,500
Why are you laughing?

476
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:24,500
I'm sorry.

477
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,500
It's really cool.

478
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:27,500
I don't understand why you're laughing.

479
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,500
Why are you laughing?

480
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,500
Yes.

481
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:37,500
Okamoto is waiting for Takadai to see the night view of Hong Kong worth 1 million dollars.

482
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:38,500
It's a lie.

483
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:44,500
Okamoto is waiting for Takadai to see the night view of Hong Kong worth 1 million dollars.

484
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:46,500
It's a lie.

485
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:48,500
I'll show you.

486
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:51,500
It's a lie.

487
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:52,500
Aoyama.

488
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:55,500
Don't say it's beautiful.

489
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:58,500
I finally understand the meaning.

490
00:24:58,500 --> 00:24:59,500
Will this view change?

491
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:01,500
It will change.

492
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,500
I'll show you the real night view.

493
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:04,500
I think it's beautiful.

494
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:05,500
It's dirty.

495
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:07,500
It's dirty.

496
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:08,500
It's dirty.

497
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:10,500
It's dirty.

498
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:12,500
It's not beautiful.

499
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:14,500
I'm angry.

500
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:15,500
I'll show you.

501
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:17,500
It's not dirty.

502
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:18,500
I'll show you.

503
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,500
It's really beautiful.

504
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:21,500
It's really beautiful.

505
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:23,500
I'm saying it's dirty.

506
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:25,500
You should check it out.

507
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:28,500
Hello.

508
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:30,500
I can't hear you.

509
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:34,500
Can I touch it?

510
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,500
You gave it to me.

511
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:37,500
You gave it to me.

512
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:39,500
Put a switch in it.

513
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:42,500
I'm touching it.

514
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,500
You're touching it.

515
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:46,500
You're touching it.

516
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:47,500
Hello.

517
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,500
I can hear you.

518
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:51,500
I'll call you.

519
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:52,500
I got it.

520
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,500
Look at it.

521
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:56,500
What are you doing?

522
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:58,500
Look at it.

523
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,500
It's dirty.

524
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:06,500
Finally, Okamoto will show you the real night view.

525
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:12,500
He's waiting for manager Okamoto's night view setting.

526
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:14,500
I'm back.

527
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:16,500
Why are you here?

528
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:20,500
Why are you here?

529
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:22,500
Why are you here?

530
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,500
Why are you here?

531
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,500
He doesn't like it.

532
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:28,500
Why are you here?

533
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:30,500
I'm here to borrow it.

534
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:34,500
You go.

535
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:35,500
You go.

536
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:38,500
I'm here to borrow the car.

537
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:40,500
Okamoto, you can't be gone like this.

538
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,500
Why is it so dirty?

539
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:44,500
Why is it so dirty?

540
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,500
It's dirty.

541
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:52,500
No, it's not dirty.

542
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:54,500
It's not dirty.

543
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:56,500
It's not dirty.

544
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:58,500
No, it's not dirty.

545
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:02,500
It's not dirty.

546
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:04,500
It's not dirty.

547
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:06,500
It's not dirty.

548
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:07,500
I'm going to beat you!

549
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:08,500
No, no, no.

550
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:10,500
No.

551
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:11,500
I'm going to do it until you apologize.

552
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,500
I'm talking about the technique.

553
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:17,500
Technique?

554
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:19,500
This...

555
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:20,500
This...

556
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:22,500
Jabu...

557
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:23,500
Jabu?

558
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:25,500
Jabu?

559
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:26,500
Jabu?

560
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:27,500
It's definitely not going to work.

561
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:28,500
I'm confident.

562
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,500
Jabu is amazing.

563
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:32,500
That's a great decision.

564
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:35,500
If Jabu comes to me,

565
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:38,500
I'll just go and hit him.

566
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:40,500
I'll just go and hit him.

567
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:44,500
I'll just go and hit him.

568
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:47,500
I'm not that small.

569
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:48,500
I'm not that small.

570
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:51,500
I'm going to beat you up.

571
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:55,500
That's funny.

572
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:56,500
I'm going to beat you up.

573
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:57,500
I'm going to beat you up.

574
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:00,500
I'm going to beat you up.

575
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:02,500
He has to wait for an hour.

576
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:04,500
I'm going to beat you up.

577
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:05,500
That's too much.

578
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:06,500
That's too much.

579
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:11,500
What is it?

580
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:15,500
I'm going to beat you up.

581
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:18,500
What did you say at first?

582
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,500
I'm going to do it again.

583
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:21,500
Okay.

584
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,500
I'm going to beat you up.

585
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:25,500
That's stupid.

586
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,500
Where are you?

587
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:29,500
Where are you?

588
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:31,500
I'm here.

589
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:32,500
I'm here.

590
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:35,500
I don't know where you are.

591
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:37,500
Where?

592
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,500
I'm going to show you now.

593
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,500
You're still beautiful.

594
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:45,500
I hope you come.

595
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:46,500
I'm scared.

596
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:47,500
I'm going to beat you up.

597
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:50,500
What did you say at first?

598
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:54,500
I'm going to beat you up.

599
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:55,500
That's stupid.

600
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:59,500
I'm going to beat you up.

601
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:05,500
I'm going to beat you up.

602
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:07,500
That's stupid.

603
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:11,500
What is it?

604
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,500
Something is shining.

605
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,500
Something is shining.

606
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:17,500
Something is shining.

607
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:18,500
What is it?

608
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:21,500
Something is moving.

609
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:22,500
What is it?

610
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:28,500
It's hard to tell if it's on or off.

611
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,500
Can you tell?

612
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:30,500
Something is moving.

613
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:31,500
Can you tell?

614
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:36,500
Can you tell if it's on or off?

615
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:40,500
It's off.

616
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,500
It's on.

617
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:43,500
It's off.

618
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:46,500
I don't know what it is.

619
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,500
I don't know what it is.

620
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:51,500
I don't know what it is.

621
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:52,500
Mr. Okamoto.

622
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:53,500
I'm doing it.

623
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,500
What?

624
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:56,500
That's enough.

625
00:29:58,500 --> 00:29:59,500
It's not enough.

626
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:01,500
You're talking too much.

627
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:02,500
Yes.

628
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:04,500
Don't talk too much.

629
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:06,500
What is it?

630
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:14,500
What should we do?

631
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:15,500
It's beautiful.

632
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:17,500
You should look at it closer.

633
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:20,500
Do you mean we should go there?

634
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:22,500
Come here quickly.

635
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:23,500
What do you mean?

636
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:25,500
It's annoying.

637
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:26,500
I'm going.

638
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:27,500
Please wait.

639
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:28,500
It's annoying.

640
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:30,500
I'm going.

641
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:31,500
Please wait.

642
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:34,500
They go to the high-rise building where Mr. Okamoto is waiting.

643
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,500
Let's do Magical Banana together.

644
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:39,500
Can I do it?

645
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:40,500
Yes.

646
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:42,500
Magical Banana.

647
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:44,500
If you say banana, it's yellow.

648
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:46,500
Let's start with banana.

649
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:48,500
If you say yellow, it's banana.

650
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:53,500
No.

651
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:54,500
No.

652
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:56,500
I said banana once.

653
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:58,500
If you say banana once, it's no good.

654
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:01,500
I said banana once.

655
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:02,500
Did you understand?

656
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:03,500
Yes.

657
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:05,500
It's really annoying.

658
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:07,500
Let's start with you.

659
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:11,500
Magical Banana.

660
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,500
If you say banana, it's long.

661
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:16,500
If you say long, it's string.

662
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:19,500
If you say string, it's string.

663
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:22,500
If you say string, it hurts.

664
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:25,500
If you say it hurts, it's SM.

665
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:28,500
If you say SM, it's scary.

666
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:31,500
If you say scary, it's ghost.

667
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:34,500
If you say ghost, it disappears.

668
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:39,500
If you say disappear, it's eraser.

669
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:42,500
If you say eraser, it's pencil.

670
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,500
If you say pencil, it's HB.

671
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:48,500
If you say HB, it's coffee.

672
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:53,500
If you say coffee, it's makeup.

673
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:57,500
If you say makeup, it's red.

674
00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:01,500
If you say red, it's lipstick.

675
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:04,500
If you say lipstick, it breaks.

676
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:07,500
If you say break, it's chopstick.

677
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:10,500
If you say chopstick, it's eat.

678
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:13,500
If you say eat, it's satiety.

679
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:16,500
If you say satiety, it's sleep.

680
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:23,500
If you say satiety, it's nightmare.

681
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:29,500
It hurts.

682
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:34,500
It's funny.

683
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:36,500
I don't know how to say nightmare.

684
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:37,500
It's funny.

685
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:39,500
I was told it's funny.

686
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:46,500
What Okamoto is waiting for is a lively moment in Hong Kong.

687
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:54,500
Times Square is in the center of the city of young people.

688
00:32:54,500 --> 00:33:00,500
Mr. Okamoto.

689
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:02,500
Yes.

690
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:06,500
I'm downstairs, so I'll go upstairs.

691
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:08,500
Call me.

692
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:13,500
I'm angry.

693
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:17,500
I'm being pulled around.

694
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:19,500
I'm tired.

695
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:21,500
I'm tired.

696
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:25,500
I'm tired, so I'm going home.

697
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:27,500
I'm tired.

698
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:29,500
What?

699
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:31,500
I'm tired.

700
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:36,500
I'm tired.

701
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:38,500
I'm tired, so I'm going home.

702
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:41,500
I'm tired.

703
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:43,500
I'm going up.

704
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:48,500
I'm going up?

705
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:52,500
I'm scared of climbing the ladder, so I'm going home.

706
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:55,500
Don't be scared.

707
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,500
I heard your name.

708
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:58,500
Really?

709
00:33:58,500 --> 00:33:59,500
I'm going home.

710
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:02,500
Don't go home.

711
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:07,500
Don't go home.

712
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:13,500
I don't like this.

713
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:15,500
No one's coming.

714
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:17,500
I'm going.

715
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:21,500
It's too slow to climb.

716
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:23,500
I'm scared.

717
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:24,500
I'm scared.

718
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:28,500
This is tough.

719
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:29,500
There are a lot of people.

720
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:32,500
There are a lot of people.

721
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:37,500
Take it easy.

722
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:38,500
Yamazaki, be careful.

723
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:40,500
I'm fine.

724
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:41,500
That's dangerous.

725
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:43,500
I'm scared.

726
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:44,500
Yamazaki.

727
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:45,500
I'm fine.

728
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,500
I'm scared.

729
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:48,500
I'm scared.

730
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:49,500
What are you doing?

731
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:51,500
My head.

732
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:53,500
I don't do small things.

733
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:55,500
That's right.

734
00:34:55,500 --> 00:35:04,500
I'm scared.

735
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:10,500
I'm scared because it's shining.

736
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:19,500
That's amazing.

737
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:21,500
You shouldn't climb any higher.

738
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:27,500
I want to be the most beautiful woman in Okamoto.

739
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:31,500
You shouldn't climb any higher.

740
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:33,500
What are you doing?

741
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:34,500
Don't move.

742
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:35,500
What are you doing?

743
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:36,500
Don't move.

744
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:42,500
If you get too close, it'll be hard to see.

745
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:44,500
Stop joking around.

746
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:47,500
Stop joking around.

747
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:49,500
You can see it, right?

748
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:52,500
I can see it.

749
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:58,500
It's completely different from that picture.

750
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:00,500
It's very similar to that picture.

751
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:04,500
Let's go home.

752
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:06,500
Let's go home.

753
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:08,500
Let's go home.

754
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:12,500
Let's go home.

755
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:14,500
Let's go home.

756
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:16,500
What are you doing?

757
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:19,500
I was holding back my laughter.

758
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:25,500
I can't hold back my laughter anymore.

759
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:28,500
I let go of the switch.

760
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:30,500
I let go of the switch.

761
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:32,500
My heart cooled down.

762
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:35,500
I can't go home.

763
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:37,500
Leaving Okamoto behind,

764
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:41,500
Ichido heads to Hong Kong at night.

765
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:42,500
I don't know what's going on.

766
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,500
I'm scared.

767
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:46,500
Since we're in the north,

768
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:53,500
let's get something to drink in Hong Kong.

769
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:03,500
What is this?

770
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:06,500
Japanese sake?

771
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:09,500
Japanese sake?

772
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:11,500
Is it like sake?

773
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:12,500
Is it like sake?

774
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:13,500
Japanese sake?

775
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:16,500
I don't know what Japanese sake is.

776
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:19,500
What kind of sake is this?

777
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:21,500
It's so dark.

778
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:24,500
Try drinking it.

779
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:29,500
You can drink it, right?

780
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:32,500
What's wrong?

781
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,500
It's burnt.

782
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:35,500
I don't know.

783
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:38,500
You have no guts.

784
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:39,500
Can you drink it?

785
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:40,500
I can drink it.

786
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:41,500
I have no guts.

787
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:43,500
Can you drink it?

788
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:44,500
I can drink it.

789
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:53,500
Let me see.

790
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:55,500
Don't drink too much.

791
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:57,500
You can't run away.

792
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:58,500
What should I do?

793
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:00,500
It's burnt.

794
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:02,500
Tea, tea, tea.

795
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:03,500
Don't drink too much.

796
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:07,500
You have no guts.

797
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:11,500
Let me see.

798
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:13,500
Don't do that.

799
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:14,500
Let me see.

800
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:15,500
I don't know.

801
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:19,500
I don't know.

802
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:22,500
Demi, you're amazing.

803
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,500
You're amazing.

804
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:27,500
I'm not like you.

805
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:29,500
Drink it and go.

806
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:31,500
Stop it.

807
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:32,500
Stop it.

808
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:33,500
Stop it.

809
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:36,500
Let's have a match.

810
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:39,500
Here.

811
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:41,500
Demi, you're amazing.

812
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:46,500
Let's have a match next time.

813
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:49,500
Look at this.

814
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:50,500
60 degrees.

815
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:53,500
60 degrees.

816
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:55,500
Let's go.

817
00:38:55,500 --> 00:39:02,500
Let's go.

818
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:04,500
Stop it.

819
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:07,500
Don't say such a thing.

820
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:10,500
Demi, you're amazing.

821
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:12,500
Let me see.

822
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:27,500
Let's go.

823
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:32,500
You're amazing.

824
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:34,500
Why are you eating?

825
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:35,500
Why are you eating?

826
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:41,500
Don't drink too much.

827
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:45,500
Hello, friends.

828
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:52,500
The clams are good, aren't they?

829
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:54,500
This is a dried ginger.

830
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:57,500
It's delicious.

831
00:39:57,500 --> 00:40:03,500
Have you ever eaten it?

832
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:04,500
Here you are.

833
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:05,500
It's delicious, isn't it?

834
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:08,500
I'll eat the scorpion first.

835
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:10,500
Here you are.

836
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:14,500
I'll eat the scorpion one by one.

837
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:15,500
Here you are.

838
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:17,500
I'll eat it.

839
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:20,500
Are you going to eat it or not?

840
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:21,500
Are you going to eat it or not?

841
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:23,500
Go away.

842
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:24,500
Go away.

843
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:27,500
Go away.

844
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:29,500
What are you doing?

845
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:30,500
Stop it.

846
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:32,500
Hey.

847
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:33,500
I got it.

848
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:34,500
It's hot.

849
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:39,500
It's hot.

850
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:42,500
Stop it.

851
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:45,500
It's hot.

852
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:47,500
Be careful.

853
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:55,500
Be careful.

854
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:57,500
It smells like poop.

855
00:40:57,500 --> 00:41:04,500
It smells like poop.

856
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:05,500
It smells like poop.

857
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:07,500
Be careful.

858
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:08,500
Be careful.

859
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:11,500
Go away.

860
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:13,500
What are you saying?

861
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:18,500
Are you drunk?

862
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:28,500
Let's eat more.

863
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:30,500
Don't cry.

864
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:35,500
You shouldn't cry.

865
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:37,500
He is laughing.

866
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:40,500
I don't know if he is drunk.

867
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:43,500
I'll give you a chance.

868
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:47,500
Let's eat the scorpion.

869
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:49,500
Read it.

870
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:50,500
It's easy.

871
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:56,500
The scorpion.

872
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:58,500
I thought you would do that.

873
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:00,500
I thought you would do that.

874
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:02,500
I can't broadcast it.

875
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:04,500
It's over.

876
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:05,500
What is this?

877
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:12,500
It's a scorpion.

878
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:13,500
It looks like this.

879
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:15,500
You can't eat this.

880
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:16,500
There is a tree in it.

881
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:19,500
It looks like a poster of the election.

882
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:20,500
Here you are.

883
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:22,500
It's cold.

884
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:25,500
I have to do Yamasaki.

885
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:27,500
I have to do Yamasaki.

886
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:31,500
You.

887
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:35,500
You.

888
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:38,500
Smile.

889
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:40,500
It's delicious.

890
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:46,500
Smile.

891
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:50,500
That's enough.

892
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:53,500
You can't do that.

893
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:55,500
I won.

894
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:57,500
You are not good at this.

895
00:42:57,500 --> 00:43:04,500
The night in Hong Kong is getting darker.

896
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:06,500
The sun is rising.

897
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:09,500
The wind blows through the continent.

898
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:14,500
The morning in Hong Kong is early.

899
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:18,500
Good morning.

900
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:22,500
It's 7.30 in the morning.

901
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:25,500
I'm in room 732.

902
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:27,500
Who is sleeping?

903
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:41,500
Let's go.

904
00:43:41,500 --> 00:44:09,500
Who is sleeping?

905
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:13,500
Cameraman.

906
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:19,500
What is this?

907
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:23,500
I took off my underwear here.

908
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:26,500
I took a bath here.

909
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:45,500
I took a bath here.

910
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:55,500
What is this?

911
00:44:55,500 --> 00:45:10,500
This is a pouch that I put on my shoulder before shooting.

912
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:24,500
It's thick.

913
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:33,500
What is this?

914
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:58,500
What is this?

915
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:20,500
What is this?

916
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:35,500
Good morning.

917
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:53,500
You are the best.

918
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:56,500
Ouch.

919
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:57,500
What is this?

920
00:46:57,500 --> 00:47:00,500
It was a prank.

921
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:07,500
What is this?

922
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:08,500
It's strange.

923
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:09,500
Why?

924
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:10,500
What is this?

925
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:21,500
It was a prank.

926
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:23,500
You are funny.

927
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:28,500
You look like a murderer.

928
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:31,500
This is half.

929
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:33,500
It's okay.

930
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:37,500
Let's take a bath together.

931
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:39,500
Come here.

932
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:54,500
I was surprised.

933
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:58,500
This is half.

934
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:03,500
This is nothing.

935
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:08,500
I think I will be bitten by a bug.

936
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:22,500
I think I will be bitten by a bug.

937
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:27,500
I got it.

938
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:31,500
Let's take a bath together.

939
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:36,500
You two look like new stars.

940
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:40,500
I will be bitten by a bug.

941
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:49,500
I think I will be bitten by a bug.

942
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:55,500
Please watch this video.

943
00:48:55,500 --> 00:49:04,500
Why didn't you appear in the report?

944
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:14,500
You should have been bitten by a bug.

945
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:21,500
I think I will be bitten by a bug.

946
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:26,500
I want you to wake up.

947
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:29,500
I want you to wake up.

948
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:32,500
What do you mean?

949
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:35,500
You are very vital.

950
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:37,500
I don't understand.

951
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:45,500
I want you to wake up.

952
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:49,500
I want you to wake up.

953
00:49:49,500 --> 00:50:10,500
Let's go.

954
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:39,500
He is in this room.

955
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:44,500
I want you to wake up.

956
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:54,500
I want you to wake up.

957
00:50:54,500 --> 00:51:14,500
I want you to wake up.

958
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:24,500
Why is it messy?

959
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:36,500
Let's go to the bathroom.

960
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:44,500
It doesn't change much.

961
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:48,500
I didn't see the TV.

962
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:58,500
Did you sleep there?

963
00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:04,500
Why don't you sleep like this?

964
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:18,500
Why don't you use the bed efficiently?

965
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:23,500
Old man.

966
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:38,500
Old man.

967
00:52:38,500 --> 00:53:06,500
Old man.

968
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:17,500
Old man.

969
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:21,500
What is this?

970
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:24,500
It's funny.

971
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:37,500
It was funny when I was sleeping.

972
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:40,500
You are not good at it.

973
00:53:40,500 --> 00:54:01,500
It was funny when I was sleeping.

974
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:11,500
Old man, why don't you sleep with me?

975
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:32,500
Old man, why don't you sleep with me?

976
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:42,500
I want you to wake up.

977
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:49,500
Why don't you sleep with me?

978
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:56,500
It's messy.

979
00:54:56,500 --> 00:55:01,500
I want you to wake up.

980
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:12,500
I want you to wake up.

981
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:20,500
Both were funny.

982
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:40,500
I want you to wake up.

983
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:48,500
Old man.

984
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:58,500
Old man, why don't you sleep with me?

985
00:55:58,500 --> 00:56:08,500
Old man, why don't you sleep with me?

986
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:23,500
Old man, why don't you sleep with me?

987
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:33,500
Old man, why don't you sleep with me?

988
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:41,500
Old man, why don't you sleep with me?

989
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:48,500
Old man, why don't you sleep with me?

990
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:58,500
Old man, why don't you sleep with me?

991
00:56:58,500 --> 00:57:08,500
Old man, why don't you sleep with me?

992
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:18,500
Old man, why don't you sleep with me?

993
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:27,500
Old man, why don't you sleep with me?

994
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:37,500
Old man, why don't you sleep with me?

995
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:47,500
Old man, why don't you sleep with me?

996
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:56,500
Old man, why don't you sleep with me?

997
00:57:56,500 --> 00:58:06,500
Old man, why don't you sleep with me?

998
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:16,500
Old man, why don't you sleep with me?

999
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:25,500
Old man, why don't you sleep with me?

1000
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:33,500
Old man, why don't you sleep with me?

1001
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:43,500
Old man, why don't you sleep with me?

1002
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:53,500
Old man, why don't you sleep with me?

1003
00:58:53,500 --> 00:59:03,500
Old man, why don't you sleep with me?

1004
00:59:03,500 --> 00:59:13,500
Old man, why don't you sleep with me?

1005
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:22,500
Old man, why don't you sleep with me?

1006
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:30,500
Old man, why don't you sleep with me?

1007
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:40,500
Old man, why don't you sleep with me?

1008
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:50,500
Old man, why don't you sleep with me?

1009
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:58,500
Old man, why don't you sleep with me?

1010
00:59:58,500 --> 01:00:08,500
Old man, why don't you sleep with me?

1011
01:00:08,500 --> 01:00:18,500
Old man, why don't you sleep with me?

1012
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:28,500
Old man, why don't you sleep with me?

1013
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:38,500
Old man, why don't you sleep with me?

1014
01:00:38,500 --> 01:00:48,500
Old man, why don't you sleep with me?

1015
01:00:48,500 --> 01:00:58,500
Old man, why don't you sleep with me?

1016
01:00:58,500 --> 01:01:08,500
Old man, why don't you sleep with me?

1017
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:18,500
Old man, why don't you sleep with me?

1018
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:28,500
Old man, why don't you sleep with me?

1019
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:38,500
Old man, why don't you sleep with me?

1020
01:01:38,500 --> 01:01:48,500
Old man, why don't you sleep with me?

1021
01:01:48,500 --> 01:01:58,500
Old man, why don't you sleep with me?

1022
01:01:58,500 --> 01:02:12,500
Sorry, sorry

1023
01:02:12,500 --> 01:02:18,500
What do you mean?

1024
01:02:18,500 --> 01:02:24,500
What are you doing?

1025
01:02:24,500 --> 01:02:30,500
What are you doing?

1026
01:02:30,500 --> 01:02:32,500
What are you doing?

1027
01:02:32,500 --> 01:02:36,500
I'm telling you, it's not over yet

1028
01:02:36,500 --> 01:02:42,500
I have a scar on my belly

1029
01:02:42,500 --> 01:02:44,500
Look at him

1030
01:02:44,500 --> 01:02:46,500
You should stop

1031
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:53,500
Look at him, he's stuck

1032
01:02:53,500 --> 01:02:59,500
It's rock climbing

1033
01:02:59,500 --> 01:03:03,500
You know what I want to do in Hong Kong

1034
01:03:03,500 --> 01:03:09,500
I don't know

1035
01:03:09,500 --> 01:03:13,500
What a big face

1036
01:03:13,500 --> 01:03:22,500
I'll do Kulon, Okamoto, Horoyoi and Hashigo

1037
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:27,500
Kulon, Okamoto, Horoyoi and Hashigo

1038
01:03:27,500 --> 01:03:29,500
What's that?

1039
01:03:29,500 --> 01:03:33,500
I know

1040
01:03:33,500 --> 01:03:36,500
I'll do as you say

1041
01:03:36,500 --> 01:03:48,500
Okamoto goes to the blue sea to transform into a dragon

1042
01:03:48,500 --> 01:03:54,500
Okamoto, what are you doing?

1043
01:03:54,500 --> 01:03:57,500
Hi

1044
01:03:57,500 --> 01:04:00,500
Hello

1045
01:04:09,500 --> 01:04:12,500
I'll be back soon

1046
01:04:12,500 --> 01:04:15,500
Watch me

1047
01:04:15,500 --> 01:04:20,500
The bridge is narrow

1048
01:04:20,500 --> 01:04:24,500
I can go to the sky

1049
01:04:24,500 --> 01:04:26,500
You can go there

1050
01:04:26,500 --> 01:04:29,500
No way

1051
01:04:29,500 --> 01:04:34,500
Hey

1052
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:37,500
He said so

1053
01:04:37,500 --> 01:04:40,500
Watch me

1054
01:04:40,500 --> 01:04:42,500
Where are you going?

1055
01:04:42,500 --> 01:04:44,500
To the sky

1056
01:04:44,500 --> 01:04:47,500
We can go home now

1057
01:04:47,500 --> 01:04:50,500
Let's get caught

1058
01:04:50,500 --> 01:04:53,500
Let's go

1059
01:04:53,500 --> 01:05:19,500
Watch me

1060
01:05:19,500 --> 01:05:26,500
Okamoto transforms into a dragon and dances to the sky

1061
01:05:31,500 --> 01:05:34,500
You are like a male

1062
01:05:34,500 --> 01:05:37,500
You scared me

1063
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:40,500
You are cold

1064
01:05:40,500 --> 01:05:46,500
I'll do it now

1065
01:05:46,500 --> 01:05:49,500
Let's go

1066
01:05:53,500 --> 01:05:56,500
What are you doing?

1067
01:05:56,500 --> 01:05:59,500
Are you sleeping?

1068
01:05:59,500 --> 01:06:01,500
What are you doing?

1069
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:03,500
Studying

1070
01:06:03,500 --> 01:06:05,500
I'm not tired

1071
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:08,500
I'm tired

1072
01:06:08,500 --> 01:06:12,500
No, I'm fine

1073
01:06:12,500 --> 01:06:16,500
You are like a baton

1074
01:06:16,500 --> 01:06:18,500
Let's go

1075
01:06:24,500 --> 01:06:26,500
What are you doing?

1076
01:06:26,500 --> 01:06:28,500
I don't know

1077
01:06:28,500 --> 01:06:42,500
Ready?

1078
01:06:42,500 --> 01:06:46,500
It's spicy

1079
01:06:46,500 --> 01:06:53,500
Don't say it's spicy

1080
01:06:53,500 --> 01:06:56,500
He is a fool

1081
01:06:56,500 --> 01:07:02,500
You are like a dragon

1082
01:07:02,500 --> 01:07:05,500
Let's go

1083
01:07:05,500 --> 01:07:08,500
Ouch

1084
01:07:08,500 --> 01:07:12,500
I hit your face

1085
01:07:12,500 --> 01:07:16,500
I hit your face with that bamboo

1086
01:07:22,500 --> 01:07:25,500
I hit your face with that bamboo

1087
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:29,500
Your head is in the way

1088
01:07:29,500 --> 01:07:33,500
Try to swim without your head

1089
01:07:33,500 --> 01:07:35,500
Without my head?

1090
01:07:35,500 --> 01:07:39,500
I'll do it

1091
01:07:39,500 --> 01:07:45,500
Watch me

1092
01:07:45,500 --> 01:07:48,500
I'm going to die

1093
01:07:48,500 --> 01:07:58,500
Oh my god

1094
01:07:58,500 --> 01:08:01,500
That was scary

1095
01:08:01,500 --> 01:08:05,500
I climbed the sky

1096
01:08:05,500 --> 01:08:07,500
Let's do it again

1097
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:10,500
Let's dive and swim

1098
01:08:10,500 --> 01:08:12,500
I think we can do it

1099
01:08:12,500 --> 01:08:15,500
You are right

1100
01:08:15,500 --> 01:08:18,500
I know you want to go from the top

1101
01:08:18,500 --> 01:08:20,500
You are right

1102
01:08:20,500 --> 01:08:24,500
I'm going to try

1103
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:30,500
I'm going to try

1104
01:08:30,500 --> 01:08:33,500
Where are you going?

1105
01:08:33,500 --> 01:08:43,500
I'm going to sink

1106
01:08:43,500 --> 01:08:49,500
You can't do that

1107
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:53,500
It's so spicy

1108
01:08:53,500 --> 01:08:59,500
You should dive and hold the bamboo

1109
01:08:59,500 --> 01:09:03,500
What should I do?

1110
01:09:03,500 --> 01:09:07,500
You said you wanted to do it

1111
01:09:07,500 --> 01:09:10,500
I was listening to you

1112
01:09:10,500 --> 01:09:13,500
I can't do anything

1113
01:09:13,500 --> 01:09:17,500
You can do whatever you want

1114
01:09:17,500 --> 01:09:23,500
I can't do anything

1115
01:09:23,500 --> 01:09:25,500
I can do anything

1116
01:09:25,500 --> 01:09:30,500
I'm going to go

1117
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:33,500
What?

1118
01:09:33,500 --> 01:09:35,500
He's doing it

1119
01:09:35,500 --> 01:09:38,500
He's doing it in order

1120
01:09:38,500 --> 01:09:46,500
He's doing it in order

1121
01:09:46,500 --> 01:09:50,500
You are so annoying

1122
01:09:50,500 --> 01:10:00,500
Look at your dirty face

1123
01:10:00,500 --> 01:10:02,500
Let's go home

1124
01:10:02,500 --> 01:10:04,500
Let's go home

1125
01:10:04,500 --> 01:10:15,500
It's not good

1126
01:10:15,500 --> 01:10:21,500
It's not good

1127
01:10:21,500 --> 01:10:27,500
I'm sad

1128

1131
01:10:39,500 --> 01:10:43,500

I'm so sad

1137
01:10:57,500 --> 01:11:00,500
Don't make me laugh

1138
01:11:00,500 --> 01:11:03,500
Wan Chai

1139
01:11:03,500 --> 01:11:08,500

01:12:24,500 --> 01:12:28,500
My towel is dirty

1153
01:12:28,500 --> 01:12:36,500
It's OK

1154
01:12:36,500 --> 01:12:39,500

1166
01:13:38,500 --> 01:13:43,500
I can't hold it

01:13:43,500 --> 01:13:46,500
I can't experience it

1168
01:13:46,500 --> 01:13:55,500

How many years have you been doing this?

I don't care

1182
01:14:48,500 --> 01:14:52,500
I have a dog-like reaction

1183
01:14:52,500 --> 01:14:57,500
I don't care if the chair is burnt

1184
01:14:57,500 --> 01:15:02,500
I don't care if the chair is burnt

1185
