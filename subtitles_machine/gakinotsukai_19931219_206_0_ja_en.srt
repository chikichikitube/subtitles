1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Just like the one

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Just like the one

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
It looks so high

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Thank you for waiting

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:57,000
From now on, we will start the Christmas Dinner Show in Downtown

7
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Hama-chan, this season has come again

8
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
It was really fun to see everyone again

9
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Last night, I couldn't sleep

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Really?

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I was so happy

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
It's okay everyone, please eat

13
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Today is the coldest day of the year

14
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Is that so?

15
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
My body is getting warm

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I don't know if you guys have it on or not

17
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Everyone, are you on it?

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Everyone is on it

19
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I'll hide it

20
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
First, please listen to the Christmas song from Yamasato Tron's album

21
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:53,000
It's snowing

22
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
The rain is too late

23
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
It will turn into snow

24
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I don't know what to do

25
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
All in love

26
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I'm sure you're like this

27
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
All alone

28
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
All in love

29
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
All in love

30
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
All in love

31
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I don't know what to do

32
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I'm sure you're like this

33
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I don't know what to do

34
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
All in love

35
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Let's do our best

36
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Thank you

37
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
There was a guy with glasses in the audience, but I couldn't see him

38
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Everyone, please eat

39
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Don't worry about the food

40
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Christmas is really romantic

41
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Everyone, is it okay to sing two songs?

42
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
It looks like you're still in good spirits

43
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Next is a farewell song

44
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I chose a farewell song for Christmas

45
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I wonder what it will be

46
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I can't speak

47
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
It's so cold

48
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Next, please listen to the song from Kariyama's album

49
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
What I remember when I open my eyes

50
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I know it's the past

51
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
That loneliness

52
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I'm sure it will change me

53
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I want to think

54
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Goodbye, how long will it last

55
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I'm sure you're like this

56
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I don't know what to do

57
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I'm sure you're like this

58
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I don't know what to do

59
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I'm sure you're like this

60
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I'm sure you're like this

61
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,000
We're scarier

62
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I can finally see everyone's faces

63
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Everyone seems to be safe

64
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Today, Hama-chan is amazing

65
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I can't open my mouth

66
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,000
It's rude

67
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
It's rude

68
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
But Hama-chan

69
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,000
It's sad, but it's time to say goodbye

70
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I forgot there was a farewell

71
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
What are you talking about?

72
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Everyone, it's time to say goodbye

73
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Please listen to Yuke Yuke Huma

74
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I'm sure you're like this

75
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I'm sure you're like this

76
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I don't know what to do

77
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I'm sure you're like this

78
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I'm sure you're like this

79
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I don't know what to do

80
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I'm sure you're like this

81
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I don't know what to do

82
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I'm sure you're like this

83
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I don't know what to do

84
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I'm sure you're like this

85
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,000
It was a really interesting movie

86
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
How was it?

87
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Everyone

88
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Hey, that's cheating

89
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Ladies and gentlemen

90
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:57,000
What are you doing?

91
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
The other day

92
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
What?

93
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
For the first time in my life, I bled

94
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Did you bleed?

95
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I bled

96
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I hit the glass table

97
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I hit it and it came out

98
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Are you okay? It hurts a little, but it's full of blood

99
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Just looking at the blood made me pale

100
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Are you okay?

101
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Men are really weak to blood

102
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
No

103
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Women are really fine

104
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Women are weak to blood

105
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Women are weak to blood

106
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I went to the hospital

107
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I told them not to come to the hospital

108
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I told them to come to the person who hit their head

109
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
They're really going to the person who hit their head

110
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
They're going to put it under their head

111
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
They're going to put it under their head

112
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
They have diarrhea

113
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I see

114
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I have diarrhea

115
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I have no appetite

116
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I understand

117
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I know

118
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
He was sleeping and didn't wake up no matter how many times I tried to wake him up.

119
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
He was dead!

120
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Why did you bring him here?

121
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I don't have anyone like that.

122
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I have one too.

123
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
When I was a chief.

124
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I was scared.

125
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Why did you become like that?

126
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
When I was in elementary school,

127
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
there was a kid called Hata who was bullied.

128
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
There was a kid called Sato who was bullied.

129
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
He said, Hata!

130
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I was next to Hata.

131
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I said, Hata!

132
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Hey, Sato!

133
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
What do you mean, Sato?

134
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Sato threw the catcher's mitt.

135
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I threw it at Hata.

136
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
It cut and went to Hata's place.

137
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
It went to my place.

138
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Damn it!

139
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
You were angry because you were beaten.

140
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Damn it!

141
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
But Sato is pretty strong.

142
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Stop it!

143
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Stop it!

144
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Sato

145
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
threw something

146
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
to someone's head.

147
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
It hit his head.

148
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I thought he was bleeding.

149
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Who was it?

150
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Was that Hata too?

151
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I saw it on the spot.

152
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I said, Hata!

153
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Sato was already over there.

154
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
He was bullied.

155
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Really?

156
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I didn't like

157
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
bullying people.

158
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
So I didn't do it.

159
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
But you did it anyway.

160
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
You were with him.

161
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
You were throwing fireworks

162
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
at an old man in Morioka.

163
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
You were doing it with him.

164
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
An old man in Morioka climbed a tree

165
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
and threw fireworks

166
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
at an old man in Morioka.

167
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Wait a minute.

168
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
That's an old man.

169
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Wait a minute.

170
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
That's an old man in Morioka.

171
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
That's an old man in Morioka.

172
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Let me make it clear.

173
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
You know it.

174
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I know it.

175
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
But I saw you doing it

176
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
with an old man in elementary school.

177
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
That's true.

178
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
You were an elementary school student

179
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
called an old man in Morioka.

180
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
That's right.

181
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I know

182
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
but I can't call my father

183
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Hiroshi.

184
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
That's strange.

185
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
There was a puddle

186
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
in the park.

187
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
There was a drum can.

188
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
A big one.

189
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I put a rotten fruit in it.

190
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
A rotten fruit?

191
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
It's called Kiyomi.

192
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
That's right.

193
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I remember it well.

194
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Before that,

195
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I put other things in it

196
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
like this.

197
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I thought it was funny.

198
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Then I put a rotten fruit in it.

199
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I thought you would do the same thing.

200
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I put a rotten fruit

201
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
in the puddle.

202
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
There was a muddy water in the rotten fruit.

203
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
The rotten fruit went home.

204
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
It's strange.

205
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Why?

206
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I don't like animals.

207
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I like animals.

208
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
That's not good.

209
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
You are killing them.

210
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I'm not killing them.

211
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Don't lie.

212
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
My family is like that.

213
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
My father is also like that.

214
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Do you know that?

215
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Do you know what will happen

216
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
if I put hot water on my throat?

217
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I've never done that.

218
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Something will come out of my butt.

219
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Wait a minute.

220
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
What is that?

221
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I did it in front of my house.

222
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
My father told me to do it.

223
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
My father told me to do it.

224
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
He told me to do it.

225
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
My cat caught a bat.

226
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
My cat caught a bat.

227
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
My cat caught a bat.

228
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
It's still moving.

229
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Come here.

230
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I'll throw a candle.

231
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I'm sorry.

232
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
No.

233
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I'll throw a candle.

234
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
A bat will come out.

235
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
A bat will come out.

236
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
A bat will come out.

237
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
A bat will come out.

238
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I don't like laughing.

239
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I don't like laughing.

240
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
My father is like that.

241
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
My father is like that.

242
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
It's hard for me.

243
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
It's hard for me.

244
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
But,

245
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
but,

246
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
he'll kill me.

247
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
He'll kill me.

248
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Everyone will run away after I die.

249
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
It's not only you and my family.

250
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Everyone will run away.

251
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Everyone will run away.

252
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
So...

253
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I'll put hot water on my throat.

254
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I'll put hot water on my throat.

255
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I was so angry that I couldn't even say anything.

256
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
You were dead.

257
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
No, I wasn't dead.

258
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Was that a baby?

259
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
No, no, it was a baby.

260
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I was so mad.

261
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I wasn't mad.

262
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
You were just standing there.

263
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Of course I was mad.

264
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I was so mad.

265
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I was so mad.

266
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I was so mad.

267
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I was so mad.

268
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I was so mad.

269
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
You weren't mad.

270
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I said, I love you.

271
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I said, yes, yes.

272
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I said, yes, yes.

273
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I was so mad.

274
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
No, no.

275
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I was so mad.

276
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I was so mad.

277
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
How many times have I told you?

278
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

279
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I was so mad.

280
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
It was funny.

281
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
It was funny.

282
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Thank you.

283
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Oh, is that so?

284
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
The other day, I was bored in the dressing room, so I said,

285
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,000
come here, and I looked at the book for a long time.

286
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
My eyes got weird.

287
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
It's not good.

288
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
You know, I did Tetris today.

289
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I was doing Tetris for hours,

290
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
and when I finished, I stopped,

291
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
but Tetris came out of my head.

292
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I understand what you're saying.

293
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Even looking at the window of the building,

294
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I was like,

295
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,000
if I came down now, it would disappear.

296
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
It's the same as that.

297
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
If you look at my face, it's a little blurry.

298
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
That's not true.

299
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
That's not true.

300
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
That's a lie.

301
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
That's not true.

302
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I'm embarrassed.

303
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Really?

304
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Do you want to play?

305
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Sure.

306
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Do you want to talk a little more?

307
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
What time is it now?

308
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
9 o'clock 25 minutes.

309
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Did you lie to me at 9 o'clock?

310
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I don't know.

311
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Have you ever hooked up with a girl recently?

312
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
No, I haven't.

313
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Don't say recently.

314
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I haven't done it at all.

315
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
It's dirty.

316
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
It's true.

317
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I'm sure it's true.

318
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I've never done it like you.

319
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Hey, hey, hey.

320
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Do you have a boyfriend?

321
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Why do you laugh?

322
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Why do you laugh?

323
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Why do you laugh?

324
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Why do you laugh?

325
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I've done it many times,

326
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I've done it many times,

327
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I've done it many times,

328
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I've done it many times,

329
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
you're waiting with a receiver.

330
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
There was a guy who said,

331
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Bring it on!

332
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
What?

333
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
You've changed, haven't you?

334
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Don't talk like that!

335
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I haven't!

336
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
You shouldn't talk like that!

337
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I haven't!

338
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
How many Christmas presents have you bought?

339
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I haven't bought any.

340
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Why?

341
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
When are you going to buy them?

342
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I'm going to buy them!

343
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I've bought them!

344
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I buy them every year!

345
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
What are you talking about?

346
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I don't buy big ones.

347
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
But I have a lot of them.

348
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
That's strange.

349
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Why do you have so many Christmas presents?

350
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Oh, I got it.

351
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Why do you have so many?

352
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Because I'm small.

353
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I knew it!

354
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Stop that!

355
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Why do you have to stop?

356
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I don't know.

357
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Why do you have to stop?

358
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I don't know.

359
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Where is the small house?

360
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Take me with you this year.

361
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I don't want to die.

362
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
No, you can't.

363
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I can't be honest.

364
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I have a smiley face.

365
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I have a cat at home.

366
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
When the cat sleeps,

367
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
it makes a growling sound.

368
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
It makes a growling sound.

369
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
It makes a growling sound.

370
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
What is that?

371
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
It doesn't sleep.

372
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Humans have that.

373
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
When it says something,

374
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
it doesn't sleep.

375
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
In the end, the wild feelings are still there.

376
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Because it's a cat.

377
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
It's safe.

378
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Even if it sleeps at home.

379
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Even if it sleeps at home,

380
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
it makes a growling sound.

381
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
It makes a growling sound.

382
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
It makes a growling sound.

383
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I thought so.

384
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
That's what it means.

385
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Do you know?

386
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
The more cowardly an animal is,

387
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
the more ears it has.

388
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Is that so?

389
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
That's right.

390
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Really?

391
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
That's why it has two ears.

392
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
It had an operation,

393
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
but it came back to normal.

394
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
That's not true!

395
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
It's a lion.

396
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
What are you talking about?

397
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Cowardly animals have ears.

398
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
If you think about it,

399
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
it's true.

400
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
What do you mean?

401
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
It's a rabbit.

402
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Cowardly animals have ears

403
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
so they can sense when the enemy comes.

404
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Cats too.

405
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Lions are strong,

406
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
so they don't have ears.

407
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
They don't have long ears.

408
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Do you know where the lion's ears are?

409
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Around here.

410
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
You've never seen it, have you?

411
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Around here.

412
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
The ears are always

413
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
next to the eyes.

414
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
The ears are always next to the eyes.

415
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
That's not true.

416
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
The lion's vertical hair

417
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
is not the ears.

418
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
What?

419
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
It's not the ears.

420
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
The lion's vertical hair

421
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
is like this.

422
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Then it's the same as this.

423
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Really?

424
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
It looks like this,

425
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
but it has ears like this?

426
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Why do you turn the bed?

427
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
What are you talking about?

428
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Why do you turn the bed in a hotel?

429
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
What's a hotel?

430
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
You turn the bed in a love hotel.

431
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
There's no point in turning it.

432
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
You can look at it from different angles.

433
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
What?

434
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
It's a mirror barrier.

435
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
You can look at it from different angles?

436
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
That's a third party.

437
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
No, it's a mirror barrier.

438
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
What?

439
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
This is a mirror barrier too.

440
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Normally, it's just this.

441
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Normally, it's just this.

442
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
You can look at it.

443
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
That's why you're turning it.

444
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
No, no.

445
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
The top and the sides are the same.

446
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
No.

447
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
No.

448
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
It's a love hotel,

449
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
but the two of you are burning in the bed.

450
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
But the two of you are burning in the bed.

451
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
It's not burning.

452
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
It's burning.

453
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
It's burning.

454
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
It's burning,

455
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
so if you don't turn it,

456
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
it won't burn properly.

457
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
White eyes.

458
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
It's hot around here,

459
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
but you're burning it well.

460
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
It's hot around here,

461
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
but you're burning it well.

462
