1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Which one do you like more, Chikichiki or Tsukikirai?

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Daiki!

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Three times?

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
What?

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Well, it depends on the person.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to do that.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I'm sorry.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Daiki-san!

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Yes, yes.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I've done it once or twice so far.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The moment I saw this, I knew what you were going to do.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
This is...

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
...a photo zone for celebrities.

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Mr. Matsumoto, from A to D, from the bottom, you can put whatever you like or don't like.

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'll put it.

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
But it's not our intention!

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
That's all.

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I'll talk about why I like you and why I don't like you.

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Well, well, well.

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Even if you hate someone you like, there are some things you don't like about them.

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
There aren't?

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Which one should we go with?

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Well, Hamada's...

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
You don't like him?

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I don't like him.

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
It's not that I don't like him.

27
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
It's that I don't like him.

28
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I don't like him.

29
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Well, even if you say that...

30
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
...don't you feel like you're doing something behind his back?

31
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Well, I feel like he's been researching everything and then talking about it.

32
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
If you say something, he'll hug you in the coffin.

33
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
That's right.

34
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I feel sorry for you.

35
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I heard a rumor about you.

36
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Even if you say things like, I feel sorry for you, he'll hug you in the coffin.

37
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
He doesn't even look around.

38
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
You go first.

39
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I'll go first because I don't like him.

40
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
You don't like him.

41
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I don't like him.

42
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
You don't like him?

43
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Why?

44
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I'm a Zura researcher.

45
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I can see through people on TV who aren't Zura.

46
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I can see through people who aren't Zura.

47
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
His baldness is fake baldness.

48
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
This is really baldness.

49
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
That baldness is strange.

50
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
It's strange.

51
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
There are baldnesses like this.

52
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
That's probably because someone at home is eating.

53
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I'm not eating.

54
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I'm not eating.

55
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I'm not eating.

56
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I'm not eating.

57
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I'm not eating.

58
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I'm not eating.

59
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
When I'm eating at home, my baldness is very big.

60
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
That's a really big baldness.

61
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
A person who's eating can't even put a hairband on his head.

62
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Hey, hey, hey!

63
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
That baldness is big.

64
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
It's a baldness a woman in her 40s did.

65
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
That's no good.

66
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
But you like it.

67
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
That's no good.

68
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
If you like it, then it's fine.

69
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I don't think you can tell from this photo, but recently there's a lot of white stuff around here.

70
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
That's right.

71
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
That's making Dandy-sa even more powerful.

72
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
But doesn't it look like that on TV?

73
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Doesn't it look like you like it?

74
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
No, not at all.

75
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
It kind of looks kind.

76
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Even if you don't say it, I know it.

77
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
This photo was taken after plastic surgery.

78
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
That's not true!

79
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
What do you mean by plastic surgery?

80
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
It makes you look attractive.

81
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
That's right.

82
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Normally, when you get married or become popular, people will try to protect you.

83
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
But he doesn't have that.

84
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Is that so?

85
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I heard that he has his own room in his house.

86
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:25,000
But here, he has his own AV.

87
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
It's like he has his own house.

88
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Even after his wife goes to bed, he's watching the video with both hands.

89
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
That's amazing.

90
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I want to watch it too.

91
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
That's right.

92
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Is that so?

93
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Do you like it?

94
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Yes, I like it.

95
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
He's a good guy.

96
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Really?

97
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
He's a good guy, but he's a bit dirty.

98
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,000
He keeps asking me to give him money.

99
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Hello? Hello? Hello?

100
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
My house?

101
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I want to buy a house.

102
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I heard that if you spend 3 million yen on it, it will be really nice.

103
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
3 million yen...

104
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Is that okay?

105
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
What's okay?

106
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
What's okay?

107
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
What are you talking about?

108
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I'm a good guy, including that kind of cuteness.

109
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Open it.

110
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Rex the Dinosaur Man.

111
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Are you Yumi Adachi?

112
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Everyone says you're cute.

113
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
From what I see, this woman is probably 22 or 23 years old.

114
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
She's a child.

115
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
What do you think of this?

116
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,000
You said you liked it, but why are you worried?

117
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
But your smile is beautiful.

118
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Your smile is beautiful.

119
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I like this part.

120
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
His...

121
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
It's the same.

122
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I call this part an electronic brain.

123
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I've never done that before.

124
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
This kind of area.

125
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Please think of something here.

126
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Dora!

127
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Do you like this?

128
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I hate it.

129
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Last year, we did it for 24 hours.

130
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
We did it.

131
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
We did it once, and then we went back to the stage.

132
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
The three of us did it.

133
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
We've been doing it for a long time.

134
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
The three of us sat down and looked at each other.

135
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Why are you talking like that?

136
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Hey, wait!

137
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Stand up and say, good morning!

138
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I thought so.

139
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Look at each other and say, good morning!

140
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
You don't even say hello.

141
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
That's right.

142
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
He's doing a music show.

143
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
How long has it been?

144
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
It's been a long time.

145
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I'm here.

146
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I don't know.

147
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Look at me.

148
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Thank you very much.

149
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
There are a lot of people like that.

150
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I don't know much about it.

151
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Senior!

152
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,000
You don't feel that way when you watch TV, right?

153
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
There are reporters around you.

154
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
The scene is different.

155
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
There are a lot of them.

156
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
That's right.

157
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
What are you writing?

158
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I'm not writing here.

159
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I'm going to quit the show called Gaki no Tsukai.

160
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I'm talking without saying anything.

161
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I will say something.

162
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I will say, it's open!

163
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I'm going home and I said, it's open!

164
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I think they cut it.

165
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
But when I look at the video, it's completely on air.

166
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
It's on air.

167
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I don't know what will come out.

168
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,200
I don't want to call you because there's a photo in the fan letter.

169
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,200
I already did it!

170
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,200
What is it?

171
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,700
Wait, wait!

172
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:05,700
Wait!

173
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,200
I already did it!

174
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,200
Wait!

175
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,700
What is it?

176
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:15,700
No, no, don't say it.

177
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,200
We're friends!

178
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,700
What is it?

179
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:20,700
Hey, do it!

180
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:22,700
But...

181
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:24,700
What is it?

182
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:26,700
What is it?

183
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,700
I don't need your help.

184
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:30,700
I don't need your help!

185
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,700
I don't need you to call me because there's a photo in the fan letter.

186
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,700
I don't need you to call me because there's a photo in the fan letter.

187
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,700
We're friends.

188
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:38,700
Thank you.

189
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,700
I'll be your fan from now on.

190
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:42,700
You're lying!

191
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:44,700
If it's only that, it's fine.

192
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,700
Then I'll tell you.

193
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:50,700
And then we can talk and meet.

194
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:52,700
No, it's fine.

195
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:56,700
What you're saying is what I'm going to say next.

196
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,700
No, no, no, no, no.

197
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,700
I didn't do it.

198
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,700
I didn't do it.

199
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:06,700
But we can talk and meet.

200
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,700
And then we can come to your house.

201
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,700
That's fine.

202
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:11,700
No, no.

203
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,700
We can hold each other.

204
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,700
No, no.

205
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,700
That's not it.

206
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,700
No, no, no, no.

207
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:23,700
Why are you holding me when we're not talking?

208
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:24,700
No, no, no, no, no.

209
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:27,700
If we're not talking, let's talk.

210
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,700
Why are you holding me?

211
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,700
What do you mean you're holding me?

212
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:35,700
It's funny that we're not talking.

213
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,700
There's something like that.

214
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,700
No, no.

215
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:46,700
Then what are you going to do after you hold me?

216
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:47,700
Then let's talk.

217
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:51,700
You can hold me and drop me on the bed.

218
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:55,700
Well, let's talk.

219
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:56,700
I dropped you on the bed.

220
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:57,700
I held you.

221
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:58,700
I held you.

222
00:10:58,700 --> 00:10:59,700
I dropped you on the bed.

223
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,700
I dropped you.

224
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:02,700
It's going to happen.

225
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:03,700
It's going to happen.

226
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:06,700
What do you think of this?

227
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,700
I'll check it out.

228
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:10,700
It's fun.

229
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,700
I'll probably tell you.

230
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:13,700
I'll tell you.

231
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:14,700
I'll send you home.

232
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,700
What are you going to tell me?

233
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:18,700
I'll send you home.

234
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:20,700
Aoka?

235
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,700
What is this?

236
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:27,700
Kento 12-jou.

237
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:28,700
What is 12-jou?

238
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:29,700
I don't understand.

239
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:30,700
You're going to get caught in something.

240
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:32,700
Bonnyo-yoyo is no good.

241
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:36,700
I'm going to get caught by that person.

242
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,700
But!

243
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:41,700
I told you not to hold me.

244
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:46,700
I don't have it, but you can hold me.

245
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:48,700
I don't have it, but you can hold me.

246
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:49,700
That's not true.

247
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:50,700
I'm doing it with him.

248
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:51,700
I think so.

249
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:52,700
I don't think so.

250
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:53,700
You don't think so.

251
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,700
Why?

252
00:11:55,700 --> 00:12:01,700
I think he's going to do it.

253
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:02,700
You think so, don't you?

254
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,700
You did Bonnyo-yoyo, didn't you?

255
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:07,700
But after Bonnyo-yoyo, you did something different, didn't you?

256
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:08,700
I think so.

257
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:14,700
What is Bonnyo-yoyo?

258
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:18,700
I can't think of anything.

259
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:25,700
I thought I was doing a lot of things that would lead to misunderstandings.

260
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:30,700
I don't know if it's really something that would lead to misunderstandings.

261
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:34,700
I quit recently, but there was a story a long time ago.

262
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:39,700
When I was not caught by a taxi, a girl was running around in a car.

263
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,700
I was noticed by her.

264
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:47,700
I told her to get in the car and I told her not to go anywhere.

265
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:50,700
You are a talent.

266
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,700
I was doing it well.

267
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,700
You're good, but you're not good at all.

268
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:55,700
What is it?

269
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:59,700
You're not good at martial arts.

270
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,700
I'm not good at martial arts.

271
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:02,700
Of course, it doesn't matter.

272
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:05,700
I'm not good at martial arts.

273
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,700
I said thank you.

274
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:12,700
She said she would let me do it.

275
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:14,700
I was doing it from time to time.

276
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,700
I thought I couldn't do it.

277
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,700
What hurts?

278
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:19,700
That hurts the most.

279
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:23,700
You can't do it anymore?

280
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:26,700
It doesn't matter.

281
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:29,700
I really don't like it.

282
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:33,700
It doesn't matter.

283
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,700
You move too much.

284
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:38,700
Why do I move so much?

285
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,700
I know you're hungry.

286
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:46,700
You shouldn't walk around and eat.

287
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:52,700
I go out to eat as much as possible.

288
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:55,700
I go to family restaurants.

289
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:57,700
I'm not a woman.

290
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:00,700
I go to family restaurants.

291
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:08,700
I wear a hat and absorb the rumors that I hear from people around me.

292
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:11,700
I make a line with it.

293
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:17,700
Why?

294
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:20,700
I've never heard of it.

295
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:23,700
I think the number of fans has decreased.

296
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:24,700
I don't think so.

297
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:26,700
No, it's decreasing.

298
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:32,700
I heard it from someone.

299
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:35,700
You had a press conference today, didn't you?

300
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:42,700
What?

301
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:45,700
I don't know what you're talking about.

302
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:50,700
You had a press conference yesterday, didn't you?

303
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:56,700
You had a press conference yesterday, didn't you?

304
00:14:56,700 --> 00:15:00,700
You had a press conference yesterday, didn't you?

305
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:01,700
In the morning and in the afternoon.

306
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:02,700
In the morning and in the afternoon, didn't you?

307
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:08,700
So the magazines and newspapers that came out yesterday, and the train...

308
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:09,700
Nakazuri?

309
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:12,700
Nakazuri came out yesterday, didn't it?

310
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:13,700
I think it's already out.

311
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:19,700
From yesterday morning, at least until this morning, I believe it.

312
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:26,700
When someone was on the train, I could hear the voice of a high school girl watching Nakazuri.

313
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:27,700
I see.

314
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:30,700
It was shocking.

315
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:33,700
It was shocking.

316
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,700
Say it from the beginning.

317
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,700
Why are you making me say it?

318
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:40,700
That's what I thought.

319
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:50,700
I saw yesterday's magazine, for example, my fan saw a magazine or newspaper and was shocked.

320
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:53,700
But my mother said, Yuriko, hurry up.

321
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:56,700
I'm going.

322
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:58,700
Where are you going?

323
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,700
Fan, fan, fan.

324
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:02,700
Fan, fan, fan.

325
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:05,700
What are you doing?

326
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:10,700
What are you doing?

327
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:13,700
Where are you going, Yuriko?

328
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:17,700
What?

329
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:20,700
Venezuela.

330
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,700
I got it.

331
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:28,700
After my father's work, I have to go to Venezuela with my family.

332
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:30,700
I can't make it on time for the flight.

333
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:35,700
I saw the magazine when I was about to leave, but I didn't see the newspaper.

334
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,700
Fan, fan, fan.

335
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,700
I flew to Venezuela.

336
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:40,700
I flew to Venezuela.

337
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:45,700
This Yuriko from Venezuela still thinks that I have a beard.

338
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,700
That's right.

339
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:55,700
How can I contact this Yuriko from Venezuela?

340
00:16:55,700 --> 00:17:00,700
Are you stupid?

341
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:02,700
I was watching the weather forecast on NHK.

342
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:06,700
You look like a very serious man with glasses on.

343
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:10,700
The chance of rain tomorrow in Tokyo is 10%.

344
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:16,700
But I'm sorry if it rains.

345
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:18,700
I was shocked.

346
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:23,700
I was shocked.

347
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,700
NHK did the same thing.

348
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:27,700
NHK is falling apart.

349
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:28,700
Really?

350
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:33,700
In the past, NHK used to do rock music.

351
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:36,700
I think they will do a commercial.

352
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:41,700
That's not true.

353
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:53,700
Sometimes I draw around here.

354
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:58,700
It depends on where I draw.

355
00:17:58,700 --> 00:17:59,700
What?

356
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,700
There is something psychological.

357
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:03,700
I can do fortune-telling.

358
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:04,700
Really?

359
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:06,700
I draw here.

360
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:11,700
That's the same as the old girl in the aquarium.

361
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:14,700
That's ridiculous.

362
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:18,700
Why do humans blink?

363
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:23,700
If I open my eyes, my eyes will dry up.

364
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,700
Your eyes will dry up.

365
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:27,700
I close my eyes once.

366
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:30,700
That's not the answer.

367
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:36,700
If you die once, it's over.

368
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:39,700
You are doing it with your body.

369
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:47,700
How far do you want to go?

370
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:50,700
I'm suffering.

371
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:55,700
I'm sorry.

372
00:18:55,700 --> 00:19:04,700
If you die once, it's over.

373
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:10,700
If you blink once, you are dead.

374
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:11,700
That's it.

375
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:12,700
I see.

376
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:15,700
I hope you understand.

377
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:19,700
The director always acts with a bird.

378
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:20,700
Why?

379
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:27,700
The other day I went to get an avian.

380
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:32,700
In Switzerland.

381
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:37,700
I don't know the reason.

382
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:39,700
I'm already like that.

383
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:46,700
I think the director is like that.

384
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:52,700
The bird in the basket is the director Sakamoto.

385
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:56,700
Who is the big guy in the basket?

386
00:19:56,700 --> 00:20:01,700
He is the elevator.

387
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:04,700
It seems that there is a meeting.

388
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:08,700
This is the director Sakamoto.

389
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:13,700
But the director Sakamoto doesn't speak much even if there is a meeting.

390
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:18,700
What are you talking about?

391
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:21,700
I see.

392
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:24,700
The garbage collection will change from October 1st.

393
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:27,700
This is a social problem.

394
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:35,700
I want to see this in a commercial.

395
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,700
You have to write your name.

396
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:40,700
You have to write your phone number.

397
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:52,700
I think this system will disappear in 3 months.

398
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:54,700
This is a difficult thing.

399
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:55,700
Why is it difficult?

400
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:57,700
You are saying a good thing now.

401
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:03,700
What is difficult?

402
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:09,700
The house is full of garbage.

403
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:18,700
Even girls can't throw away their underwear because they think they can't take it off.

404
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:23,700
They throw their underwear into a bag and throw it into a transparent bag. It's the same thing!

405
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:24,700
It's meaningless.

406
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:25,700
It's meaningless, right?

407
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:29,700
I have a lot of black plastic bags.

408
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:32,700
Why don't you give me that?

409
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:38,700
I get angry, so I throw my black plastic bag into the trash and finally cover it with a transparent bag.

410
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:41,700
You know what I mean, right?

411
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:46,700
You don't know what a black condom is, do you?

412
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:48,700
It's black.

413
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:53,700
Unless it's transparent, it's useless, right?

414
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,700
That's not good!

415
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:56,700
Why not?

416
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,700
That's not good!

417
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:00,700
It's useless if you don't write your name on it.

418
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:05,700
Why do I have to write my name on it?

419
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:11,700
It's useless if you don't write your name on it.

420
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:14,700
Even if it's Tanaka-kun, it's Sato-kun.

421
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:15,700
That's not good.

422
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:18,700
If it's Sato-san, it's not good.

423
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:36,700
That's not good.
