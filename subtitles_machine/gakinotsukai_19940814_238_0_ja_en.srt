1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
In the first episode of Gaki no Tsukajiwara

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:08,000
It's cold and hot with Yamazaki Okamoto

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
These two are really cold

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Really?

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Yes

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
It's so hot

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
It's called Kokusho this year

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
It's so hot

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm shaking all the time

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Like a small dog

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I want you to be warm

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
That's a good thing

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Yamazaki always says he's cold even in the first episode

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
He's cold up to 102 degrees

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Let's warm up

16
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Yamazaki Okamoto

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
It's true

18
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Are you cold?

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
A little

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I think it's around 30 degrees

21
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
It's only 32 degrees

22
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Let's do it

23
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Which one is cold?

24
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
That's me

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
That's a good one

26
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
It's a unison

27
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I'm not cold like you

28
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Wait a minute

29
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Stop fighting

30
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
He's crying

31
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Yamazaki san is sweating

32
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm sweating

33
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
You're sweating?

34
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Because it's cold

35
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Let's go

36
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:27,000
This program is brought to you by these sponsors

37
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
First of all

38
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Spoonless

39
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I think it's a little hot

40
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Please bring it

41
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
It's really cold

42
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Let's put it in

43
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
What?

44
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Wait a minute

45
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
You can't put it in

46
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Is it impossible?

47
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
It's impossible

48
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Let's go

49
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Spoonless

50
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Ready

51
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Don't drop it

52
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
If you drop it, people around you will get in trouble

53
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
It's hot

54
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Dad

55
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Wait

56
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
It's hot

57
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I won

58
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
What is it?

59
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
It's a box

60
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I don't think there's anything

61
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Let's light it

62
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
This is good

63
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
It's better than anything

64
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
How do you light it?

65
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
With your foot

66
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
With my foot?

67
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Okamoto san

68
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Okamoto san was great

69
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
It's hot

70
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Yamasaki san

71
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
He's not good at driving

72
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Okamoto san got 1 point again

73
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Thank you

74
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
This will burn in the bar

75
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Please warm it up

76
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
You can use it as much as you want

77
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
That's right

78
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
If you can't clear it, you win

79
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Yamasaki san

80
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Let's go

81
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
It looks like a dragon

82
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
It's hot

83
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Yamasaki san is good

84
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
It's hot

85
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Okamoto san

86
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
It's hot

87
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Great

88
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Are you going to the next race with a draw?

89
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Or do you want to lead and go to the next race?

90
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Let's let the loser choose

91
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I lost and lost

92
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I'm going to the next race with a draw

93
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
You lost and lost so you're going to the next race with a draw?

94
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Can you explain the next race?

95
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
This is a bread eating competition

96
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
The string part is burning

97
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
You have to eat freshly made bread

98
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Freshly baked

99
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
It looks good

100
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:38,000
The bread at the end is burning

101
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
It's true

102
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Freshly baked

103
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Freshly baked

104
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
You have to line up in the morning

105
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
You can't eat freshly baked bread

106
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I'm glad

107
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Ready

108
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
It's good

109
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
It's a good drawing

110
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Yamasaki san, are you kissing it?

111
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
It's hot

112
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Yamasaki san, you dropped it

113
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
It was big

114
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Let's replay

115
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
It's hot

116
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
It's hot

117
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
If you bite this bread, you get 3 points

118
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
3 points?

119
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Jump

120
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
It's hot

121
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
You don't have to replay

122
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Okamoto san

123
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
He's licking it

124
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
It's hot

125
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Okamoto san again

126
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Time

127
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Time is up

128
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
He ate it

129
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
He ate it

130
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
It's a dry food

131
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Ready

132
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
It's hot

133
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
It's clean

134
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Let's do it again

135
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
It's hot

136
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Let's do it again

137
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
What a pity

138
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Let's go Okamoto san

139
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Ready

140
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
It's hot

141
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
You have to get more vegetables

142
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
We don't have enough vegetables

143
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
It's good for the last

144
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Sun is cool

145
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
We are like lions

146
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I'll do it

147
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Okamoto san first

148
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I'll show you

149
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Yamasaki san, you look like Yota osu san

150
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Let's do a mini-contest

151
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Okami, are you ready?

152
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Can I do this?

153
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
If you do this, you win

154
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Mini-contest

155
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Yota

156
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Yota

157
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I think he's going to stop

158
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Yota

159
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
He's looking at the starry sky

160
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Where did he go?

161
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Where did he go?

162
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Are you looking for him?

163
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Okami

164
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
It was fast

165
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I wanted it to be faster

166
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,000
It's a punishment for the two who couldn't do it

167
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
You have to do it twice

168
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
You drank too much

169
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Thank you

170
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Okami

171
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Ready

172
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Why?

173
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Why?

174
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Yamasaki san, you were great

175
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:31,000
The winner is Yamasaki san

176
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Congratulations

177
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
It was a good fight

178
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Thank you

179
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
It's hot

180
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
What is it?

181
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
It's quite late

182
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
It's already 10 o'clock

183
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I thought the audience was tired

184
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I'm fine

185
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Both of you are tired

186
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
But it was more interesting than Yamasaki's speech

187
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Yamasaki san, how was your speech today?

188
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
It was great

189
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
There are many things

190
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
There's nothing

191
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I'm really tired today

192
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
It was hot

193
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Summer vacation feels really long this year

194
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
There's still more

195
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I don't like summer vacation

196
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I don't want to go home

197
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
It's really hot

198
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
There's a lot of space next to my house

199
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
It's the only place that's still cool

200
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
There's a lot of space

201
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I can drink juice with one hand

202
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
It's amazing

203
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I can laugh

204
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
It's magic

205
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I can do this

206
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I can look at the car like this

207
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
It's hard to come home

208
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:45,000
But I can come home and say I'm sorry

209
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I can say it

210
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I can say it

211
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
There are people who can't make contact

212
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Even though I come home, if I come out

213
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
What is this?

214
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
It's like a person sitting on the street

215
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I can't say anything when they don't talk to me

216
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I can just say I'm not home

217
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
It's really cool

218
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
What?

219
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I just happened to be waiting for someone

220
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
What was that?

221
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
What was that?

222
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
What?

223
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
That was a new one

224
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I have a corner

225
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I'm standing there

226
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I can't come to my house

227
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I'm standing in front of my house

228
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I can't say anything

229
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I'm sure you're at home

230
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I know the story

231
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I know the story

232
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I'm in love with your eyes

233
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
If you ask me

234
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
It's not just us

235
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Most of the summer holidays

236
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
My parents call me

237
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:07,000
My daughter says she's going to stay at my house

238
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
That's not true

239
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
That's not true

240
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
It's a problem for the company

241
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I don't know if it's true inside

242
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Why are you acting like an old lady?

243
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
It's true

244
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
It's true

245
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
But there are a lot of summer holidays

246
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I want you to stop

247
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
To be honest

248
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
They really come

249
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
They ask me to stop

250
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
They ask me to stop

251
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
What?

252
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
They ask me to stop at home

253
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Half of them ask me to stop

254
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Half of them ask me to stop

255
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
You're annoying

256
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
You're not doing anything

257
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
You're a non-stop person

258
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I'm not a non-stop person

259
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
What do you mean?

260
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
You're always like that

261
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I don't hate you

262
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I think they're high school students

263
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Or junior high school students

264
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
You can't let them stay at your house

265
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
This is a big fight

266
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
In my opinion

267
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
They come by themselves

268
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
They come by themselves?

269
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
They come by themselves

270
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
You can't do that

271
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
No, really

272
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Really

273
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
In the past

274
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
How long ago?

275
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
About half a year ago?

276
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
About half a year ago?

277
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
You're already downtown

278
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
What?

279
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
You're not downtown

280
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I'm not downtown

281
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
You're almost there

282
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I'm downtown

283
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Who are you talking to?

284
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I have nothing to do

285
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I'm going to stay home

286
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
You?

287
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I have a lot of work to do

288
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I'm bored

289
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I'm full of work

290
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
You're talking to yourself

291
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
That's not true

292
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
No, no

293
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
You're a student

294
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I want you to come home

295
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I want you to stop

296
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I'll stay home

297
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I'll stay home

298
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Don't come home

299
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Do you want me to write?

300
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Yes

301
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Curry bread has curry

302
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Jam bun has jam

303
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Why does melon bun not have melon?

304
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
It's been 4 years since I started this show

305
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
It's been 4 years since I started this show

306
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
It's been 4 years since I started this show

307
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I ignored it

308
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I ignored it

309
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I ignored it

310
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I ignored it

311
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
You

312
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Why does melon bun not have melon?

313
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
No, melon bun is

314
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I named it by its appearance

315
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Which part is melon?

316
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
The pattern

317
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
This is

318
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
This is

319
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
The connection of the sky

320
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
The connection of the sky

321
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
If it's light blue

322
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
It's the sky

323
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I want you to be clear

324
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
You're thinking melon bun has melon

325
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
You're thinking melon bun has melon

326
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
But jam bun has jam

327
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
But jam bun has jam

328
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Cream bun has cream

329
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Then what?

330
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
If you name it

331
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
It's all inside

332
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
But this

333
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
There's glasses inside

334
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
You're saying that

335
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
You're saying that

336
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
You're talking about bread

337
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
You're talking about bread

338
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I'm talking about glasses

339
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
No, no, no

340
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
You're talking about bread

341
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
You're talking about bread

342
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
It doesn't hurt

343
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Then let's talk about bread only

344
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Glasses

345
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
It doesn't matter

346
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
You know glasses

347
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Glasses

348
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
That's not true

349
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
If you say that, it's easy to understand

350
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
French bread

351
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
What is French bread?

352
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
That is

353
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
The first

354
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
French bread

355
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Right?

356
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
It's not French at all

357
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
There's no French inside

358
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Croissant

359
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
What's inside?

360
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Croissant

361
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
It's like this

362
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Uguisu bread

363
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
It's not that

364
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
It's not that

365
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
What kind of bread is uguisu bread?

366
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
What kind of bread is uguisu bread?

367
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I'm asking you

368
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
What kind of bread is uguisu bread?

369
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I'm asking you

370
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
There's green filling inside

371
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Really?

372
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Yes

373
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
You said it like an artist

374
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
No, no

375
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
It's not uguisu at all

376
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
No matter how much you put it on your chest

377
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Shut up

378
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Uguisu is

379
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
It's similar to you

380
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
No one thinks it's uguisu

381
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
It's not appearance

382
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Uguisu is green

383
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,000
It's not like that

384
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Appearance and name

385
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
That's fine

386
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
It's not like that?

387
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
What do you do if you agree?

388
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I always think about soccer

389
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
There must be a reason why a soccer player should be happy when he scores a goal

390
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
There must be a reason why a soccer player should be happy when he scores a goal

391
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I'm trying to appeal

392
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I put it in

393
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Everyone is the same

394
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Everyone is the same

395
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Aren't you interested in soccer?

396
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I play soccer

397
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I play baseball

398
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
I see

399
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
You don't see it

400
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Soccer

401
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
You don't see it

402
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I don't see it

403
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
It's me

404
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Good job

405
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I have a bad luck

406
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I have a bad luck

407
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I always fail

408
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I have a bad luck

409
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
How can I get rid of bad luck?

410
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
You just think it's bad luck

411
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
You just think it's bad luck

412
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
You just think it's bad luck

413
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
You're being kind

414
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
You're being kind

415
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
You're like an old comedian

416
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
You're like an old comedian

417
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
This is his hand

418
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
This is his hand

419
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
If I'm troubled

420
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
If I'm troubled

421
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
If I'm troubled

422
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
If I'm troubled

423
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Don't get too excited

424
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Don't get too excited

425
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
That's his hand

426
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
What are you talking about?

427
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I have a bad luck

428
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I have a bad luck

429
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I have a bad luck

430
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
I have a bad luck

431
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
I have a bad luck

432
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
For example, you say

433
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
If you use your luck on something like this

434
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
It's bad luck

435
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
It's strange

436
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Why?

437
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
It's bad luck to use your luck on something like this

438
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
It's bad luck to use your luck on something like this

439
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Don't stop

440
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Who are you talking to?

441
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
I'm really about to get out

442
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Where?

443
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Teacher

444
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Are you going to get out?

445
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I'm really about to get out

446
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I'll check

447
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Last year

448
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
If you think you have bad luck

449
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Your luck will get worse

450
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
You keep getting hurt

451
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
You keep getting hurt

452
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
You keep dropping things

453
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
I was there

454
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I was there

455
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I don't remember

456
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
What?

457
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I don't remember

458
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
I don't remember

459
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
I don't remember

460
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
English that you use

461
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
There are words that can't be translated

462
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
What should I say for Parma?

463
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
What should I say for Parma?

464
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Parma?

465
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
It's English

466
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Is that so?

467
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Is that so?

468
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Permanent

469
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Permanent

470
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Teacher, teach me

471
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
What is permanent?

472
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Parma

473
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Parma means

474
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
To roll

475
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Is that so?

476
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Nento means

477
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
To do something

478
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Roll

479
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Let's roll

480
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Let's roll

481
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Let's roll

482
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Let's roll

483
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
That's permanent

484
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
For example, you don't have sunglasses

485
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
What?

486
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Japanese

487
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Do you know what glass is?

488
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Glass

489
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Wait

490
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Is it wrong?

491
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I don't know

492
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I don't know

493
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
I don't know

494
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
I don't know

495
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
I don't know

496
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I don't know

497
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
I don't know

498
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Then set

499
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I don't know
