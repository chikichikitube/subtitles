1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Congratulations!

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Thank you very much!

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Thank you very much!

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
What is this?

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Seriously?

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
It's been a year!

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Thank you very much!

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Take it!

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Thank you very much!

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Take it!

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Today...

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I was reborn as a modified human.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
From now on, I'm going to be a bad guy who hits people in the head.

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
What are you talking about? Take it off!

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I can't take it off. I'm having a surgery in Germany.

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Today, 5 people came to Mr. Reddy's place.

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
You and the person who won at the end.

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
It's a draw.

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Are you okay?

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm okay, but I can't do it like this.

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
That's fine!

22
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
It's okay to be normal.

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Now, let's introduce ourselves.

24
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
First, self-introduction.

25
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I'm Asuka Hikaru from Shinjuku, Belha. Nice to meet you.

26
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Nice to meet you.

27
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Now, number 2.

28
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm Coco. Nice to meet you.

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Number 3.

30
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm Hiro-chan from Belpoppins who also came from Shinjuku, Belha.

31
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I'm Sayaka from Belpoppins who also came from Shinjuku, Belha.

32
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
And number 5.

33
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I'm Sara.

34
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Are you sleepy?

35
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Your eyes are like this.

36
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Now, the first round!

37
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Let's start the first round! Ready, go!

38
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
You're noisy!

39
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
You're noisy!

40
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
You're noisy!

41
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Number 3.

42
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
It's hard to win.

43
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Let's start with number 3.

44
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Nice to meet you.

45
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
You have to pull it.

46
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Are you okay?

47
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Ready, go!

48
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Which one do you think is the first place?

49
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Nice to meet you.

50
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
What do you mean by the first place?

51
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I've been doing this for a long time.

52
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
You've been doing this for a long time.

53
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
You're the big brother of the big brother.

54
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I'm the big sister.

55
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
You're the big sister.

56
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Now, let's start.

57
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
It's a competition between the two of you.

58
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Ready, go!

59
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
No! No!

60
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
No way!

61
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
You bastard!

62
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Now, it's your turn.

63
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Big sister.

64
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Number 5's big sister.

65
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Big sister, your neck was shaking.

66
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
It's amazing.

67
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
You're like the boss of the Famicom.

68
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
How many times have you done this?

69
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
How many times?

70
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
How many times have you done this?

71
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
12 years.

72
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I've been doing this for 12 years.

73
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
You're the big brother of the big brother.

74
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I'm the big sister.

75
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Ready, go!

76
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I can't win.

77
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
It's amazing.

78
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I won against the Musa lady.

79
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I'm the representative of men.

80
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
That's enough!

81
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
That's enough!

82
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
He's making a circle.

83
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I was scared of his reaction.

84
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Now, it's your turn.

85
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Ready, go!

86
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Look at this.

87
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Look at this.

88
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Ready, go!

89
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I can't win.

90
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Hurry up!

91
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Now, it's your turn.

92
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Hurry up!

93
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Hurry up!

94
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Hurry up!

95
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Hurry up!

96
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Hurry up!

97
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I can't win.

98
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
If I had won, I would have won.

99
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
What do you want?

100
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Anything is fine.

101
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Ladies and gentlemen.

102
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Good evening.

103
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Today...

104
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
What is it?

105
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
What is it?

106
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
What?

107
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
What?

108
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
What do you mean we're together?

109
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
It doesn't make any sense.

110
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Why are you clapping like that?

111
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I think it's fine.

112
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Really?

113
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I'm a little upset today.

114
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Why?

115
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I'm a little upset.

116
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Why?

117
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Today, the guests...

118
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
It's like a love story.

119
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
The guests are bad today.

120
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Really?

121
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Yes.

122
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
But there are quite a lot of them.

123
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Somehow.

124
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
There are quite a lot of men today.

125
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
But it's typhoon today, right?

126
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
It's bad for the guests to come.

127
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
It's fine.

128
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
There are quite a lot of them.

129
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
You're late.

130
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I see.

131
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I was going to get angry and spread the story.

132
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
But when I came out, I saw that there were quite a lot of them.

133
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
That's right.

134
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I was thinking about it, so I didn't tell you.

135
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I didn't want to tell you, but I saw that there were quite a lot of them.

136
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
You can't get angry.

137
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I can't get angry, so it's fine.

138
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
But you came today, so it's fine.

139
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
You came a lot.

140
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Really.

141
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
There are quite a lot of men here.

142
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Look, look, look.

143
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
There's something strange about this program.

144
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Why?

145
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
The people who are watching are not clear, right?

146
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
There are various people watching.

147
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Really?

148
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Most of them are young.

149
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
The people who come here.

150
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Well, well, well.

151
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I think they sometimes bring their mothers.

152
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
There are people who come with their mothers, right?

153
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
What kind of family is it?

154
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
No, so they're close.

155
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
They come with their parents.

156
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
And if there's such a small story...

157
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
That's right.

158
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
It's hard to do it here, isn't it?

159
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
It's a small story in front of your mother.

160
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Right?

161
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
When I was in elementary school, I watched it with my parents.

162
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
It was hard to have a small story, wasn't it?

163
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
It was hard, wasn't it?

164
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I think there will be a bed scene.

165
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
But I can't run away.

166
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I've been watching everyone like this.

167
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Suddenly there was a bed scene.

168
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I can't go anywhere.

169
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
That's right.

170
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I can't run away.

171
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Why do you want to take off your pants?

172
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
It doesn't smell like your pants.

173
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
That's why I'm looking forward at the beginning.

174
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Because it doesn't mean anything.

175
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
But if you wear that kind of thing, it's like this.

176
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Your mother's face has to come forward.

177
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
If you can see your own face, it's okay.

178
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I'm looking down so that I can't see my own face.

179
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Your family is in a row.

180
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
It's not a family game.

181
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I have a family.

182
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I tried not to be able to see my face as much as possible.

183
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
But there are families where you can talk to your parents.

184
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
That's right.

185
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
There's no such thing at all.

186
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
When I was in middle school, I fought with my sister.

187
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I thought I hit her.

188
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
When my sister stood up, I hit her hip.

189
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
At that time, my family said,

190
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Don't lie to me.

191
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I said,

192
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Wait.

193
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I hit her hip, so I said,

194
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
That's right.

195
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Everyone said,

196
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I also hit my sister.

197
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I said,

198
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Hitoshi hit Naomi.

199
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
What are you talking about?

200
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Your family is in a row.

201
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
My sister also said,

202
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
If you hit your stomach, you can say,

203
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I was hit here, so my sister didn't hurt me much.

204
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Hitoshi, don't bite me.

205
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
My sister said,

206
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I don't hurt.

207
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
It doesn't hurt like a man.

208
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Your mother also said,

209
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I don't want to hurt Naomi.

210
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Why did your mother say that?

211
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
When you go over there, it's hard for your family.

212
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
But there are families where you can talk to them openly.

213
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
That's right.

214
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
This program should be more lively.

215
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
It's lively, isn't it?

216
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I'm lively, but you're not.

217
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Why am I the only one who says that?

218
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Everyone is laughing, isn't it?

219
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,000
You should also stop telling dirty jokes.

220
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I'm not doing it because I want to.

221
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I'm doing it because I want to.

222
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Who wants it?

223
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
The atmosphere on the spot.

224
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
You did it before, didn't you?

225
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
With only men.

226
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
At that time, it didn't matter, did it?

227
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
At that time, it was full of dirty jokes.

228
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Men don't want that.

229
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
If you want it, your face won't come.

230
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I said dirty jokes.

231
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
At that time, there are women.

232
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
That's right.

233
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
You did it with only men, didn't you?

234
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
What are you going to do next?

235
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
It's a strange place.

236
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I'm going to shave my beard.

237
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
That's not good.

238
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
While you're doing it, everyone is shaving their beards.

239
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
That's right.

240
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
You shouldn't say that.

241
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
You're terrible.

242
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I'm going to shave my beard.

243
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
You're going to be an old man.

244
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
You're an old man, aren't you?

245
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:47,000
When the show is done, I'm going to be called Zura Miyaburiman.

246
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
You can do that at our opening.

247
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I'm going to be dressed like Zura Miyaburiman on the train.

248
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
What kind of clothes are you wearing?

249
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I'm going to wear a cape and be a hero.

250
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I'm going to get on the train.

251
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
When I get on the train, I'm going to be called Zura.

252
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Do you understand?

253
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
When I get on the train, I'm going to be called Zura Miyaburiman.

254
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I'm going to be called Zura.

255
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
You're an idiot.

256
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
You have to do this on your new show.

257
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
The next guest is a nurse.

258
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
It's a job.

259
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I have to be older than 18.

260
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Really?

261
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Yes.

262
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Really?

263
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I didn't know that.

264
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I didn't know that.

265
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Really?

266
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I didn't know that.

267
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
That's all? That's all?

268
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Really?

269
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
That's all

270
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Well, at least once

271
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Maybe a little lower

272
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Ah, that's also possible?

273
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Yes, yes, yes

274
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Like a middle school girl

275
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
What's so funny?

276
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
It's your responsibility

277
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Wait!

278
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Until now...

279
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
You know, really

280
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I'm not interested at all in that kind of stuff

281
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
You know, I...

282
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Don't look at me like I'm a lolicon

283
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Let's go with the flag

284
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
The flag...

285
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
What are you doing?

286
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
What are you doing at such a distance?

287
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Hello, let me introduce myself

288
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I'm Tomomi Ebihara

289
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I'm 20 years old

290
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Right now...

291
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I'm a third-year student

292
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I used to be a big sister

293
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I'm also a fan of Downtown, so I wanted to be on the show

294
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Is that so?

295
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
When did you become a fan?

296
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
When was it?

297
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
A long time ago?

298
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
No, recently

299
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Recently?

300
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Did you say anything?

301
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I did

302
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
What did you say?

303
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I was a fan of Matsumoto-san

304
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
But now I'm a fan of Hamada-san

305
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I'm going to cry

306
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Why is that?

307
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I'm scared

308
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Scared?

309
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
You're scared of me?

310
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
What are you going to do if I don't come?

311
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Why?

312
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Who are you a fan of?

313
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Hamada-san

314
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Well, that's a different story

315
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Who did you become a fan of after talking to each other like this?

316
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Hamada-san

317
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Who did you become a fan of after talking to each other like this?

318
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Hamada-san

319
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
You're pretending to be delicious

320
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I see

321
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Thank you very much

322
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Thank you

323
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:42,000
On October 3rd, I was on a popular show in the fall

324
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
It was called Shobai Shobai

325
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Hama-chan called Giant Baba-san

326
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Baba!

327
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Itsumi-san

328
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Itsumi!

329
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Kayama Yuzo-san

330
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Yuzo!

331
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I said that

332
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
After the show ended, didn't you say anything?

333
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
You want to throw away your senior

334
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Can you live in the entertainment world like that?

335
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
By the way, Matsumoto-san was quite calm

336
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
But in front of the fans, he's scared of the weak

337
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
In front of the strong ones, he's being mean

338
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
He's clapping

339
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Even if the entertainment world turns against me

340
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I'll still be on your side

341
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Thank you very much

342
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
This is true

343
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
It was cut, right?

344
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Go-san also said that

345
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
That's right

346
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
At that time, he must have been very angry

347
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Why was he called out by such a guy?

348
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
That's not true

349
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Why was he called out by such a guy?

350
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Go Hiromiya

351
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Lee, today was the worst

352
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Don't get angry!

353
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
You don't sound like him at all

354
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
You're just tall

355
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Kayama-san was angry, right?

356
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Kayama-san wasn't angry

357
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Kayama-san, when I got off the elevator

358
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
We were together

359
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
We were laughing and going like this

360
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
That's because I smashed your shoulder

361
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
On the spot, you said

362
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Go Hiromiya, excuse me

363
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Ah, it's fine

364
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
You don't sound like him!

365
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Ah, it's fine

366
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Even if you say that

367
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
You don't sound like him!

368
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Even if he apologizes

369
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
At home, Lee is angry

370
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Is that so?

371
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Lee is angry

372
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Lee doesn't apologize

373
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Don't say Lee, Lee

374
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Only Lee is yelling at home

375
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I think this is quite interesting

376
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I'm a fan of the two of you since your debut

377
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I've asked my friend to record the song

378
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
But I was doing a show called

379
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
It's 4 o'clock

380
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I watched the video

381
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
And the next thing became clear

382
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
It's always Matsumoto-san who hugs

383
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Matsumoto-san was the first to cry and hug at the first concert

384
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Matsumoto-san was the first to hug with the record selling well

385
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Matsumoto-san was the first to hug and kiss with the record jacket

386
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
And so on and so forth

387
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
It was recorded in my video

388
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
And so, Hamada-san

389
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Even though Matsumoto-san is doing so much

390
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Why don't you show him the same attitude once?

391
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I feel sorry for Matsumoto-san

392
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Just once is enough

393
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Please respond to Matsumoto-san's love

394
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
But I often say that I'm a homo

395
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
That's not what I'm saying

396
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Eh?

397
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
What do you mean?

398
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
What?

399
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Do you think so?

400
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Do you think so?

401
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
When you're sleeping in the dressing room

402
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I'm already doing it

403
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I want to pee

404
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Don't say things that can't be helped

405
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
There's no way

406
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
When you're sleeping

407
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I'm already doing it

408
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
What are you talking about?

409
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I'm already doing it

410
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I'm already doing it

411
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I'm already doing it

412
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Stop with the dirty jokes

413
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Yuta, where are you going with your head?

414
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I have a boyfriend that I've been dating since middle school

415
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
The other day, I suddenly went to his apartment

416
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I was in bed with a girl I didn't know

417
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
And we had a fight

418
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I was really angry

419
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
And I said, I'll have Hama-chan do it

420
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
And then my boyfriend said

421
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,000
With your technique, Hama-chan can't beat you

422
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
That's what he said

423
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I might not be good at it

424
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
But I don't think I'm that bad

425
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I was really angry

426
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I want to break up with Hama-chan

427
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Hama-chan, please do it on TV

428
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Hama-chan, please do it

429
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Hama-chan, please do it

430
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Should I beat you?

431
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Please reply on TV

432
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
And say something to your stupid boyfriend

433
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
That's what he said

434
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
But there are things like that

435
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Technicians are better

436
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Really?

437
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Technicians are better

438
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I'm sorry to say this but

439
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Technicians are better

440
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Really?

441
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
There are people who look down on you

442
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
You look really good

443
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
But when you actually do it, it's completely different

444
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Completely different?

445
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Completely different

446
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
That's the most troublesome thing

447
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I'm like a black belt in sex

448
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
What are you talking about?

449
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
I'm a yellow belt

450
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
It's okay to just be a white belt

451
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
It's okay to just be a white belt

452
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Being a white belt is the worst

453
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
But you like white belts

454
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
The other day on a TV show

455
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Natsumi-san said that Hama-san's fart

456
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Is so smelly that it makes you want to kill it

457
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
He said that it makes you want to sit on it

458
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Is it really that smelly?

459
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Don't read it like that

460
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
We've been together for a long time

461
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I've never bothered you with your smelly fart

462
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
But if you're okay with it, please tell me

463
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I'll take care of you from now on

464
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I don't want to

465
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
You really should go see a doctor

466
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Wait a minute

467
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Don't say it with a straight face

468
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Say it with a smile

469
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Don't say it with a serious face

470
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Something's definitely wrong

471
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Are you stupid?

472
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
My fart is normal

473
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Don't underestimate it

474
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Seriously, this fart

475
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
At first I said a lot of things

476
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I threatened you and comforted you

477
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I pushed you away

478
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
But you won't stop

479
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Just one?

480
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Your fart is smelly too

481
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Compared to my fart

482
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Compared to your fart

483
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
It's completely

484
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
White belt

485
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
White belt

486
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
This guy's fart is

487
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
How should I say it

488
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Lately it's too smelly

489
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
I can't do anything about it

490
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
In a normal room

491
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
You can say it's smelly

492
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,000
But this is different

493
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
It's not something you'd think of in this world

494
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
So it's too smelly

495
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
What?

496
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
What?

497
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
That's what I think

498
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Do you understand how I feel?

499
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Is that so?

500
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
What?

501
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Don't think about your body

502
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
You know

503
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
You're in a car

504
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
For example

505
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
A salaryman with glasses

506
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
He jumps out

507
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
You're in a car

508
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
And you're like

509
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
These glasses are scary

510
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
What?

511
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:51,000
No matter what kind of life that salaryman has lived

512
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
He ends up wearing glasses

513
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Even if he's a very important person

514
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Even if he's a very important person

515
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
He has a family

516
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
He has kids

517
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
He has kids

518
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
And he's wearing glasses

519
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
He's like

520
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
These glasses are crazy

521
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
But that's what everyone says

522
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
You say that too

523
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
You say that too

524
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I do

525
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
He's like

526
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
These glasses are crazy

527
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
He's just wearing glasses

528
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
That's right

529
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
He's crazy

530
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Even if he's with a girl

531
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
He's with three girls

532
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
And they're all gathered

533
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
And he's like

534
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
I'm going with the red one

535
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
What?

536
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
You're going with the red one?

537
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
He's looking

538
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
He's like

539
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I'm going with the red one

540
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
What?

541
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
You have a nosebleed

542
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
You don't have a nosebleed on your hand

543
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Why?

544
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
You don't have a nosebleed

545
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
You don't have a nosebleed

546
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
It's been a week

547
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
What do you want to do with your nosebleed?

548
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Your nosebleed is bad

549
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
What are you saying?

550
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
You're just doing it

551
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
The nosebleed is bad

552
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
The nosebleed is bad

553
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Hello, this is Ending

554
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Hello

555
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Hello, this is Ending

556
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Yes

557
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,000
For those of you who haven't seen it, there's a little kid in downtown

558
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Ah! It's Piano Bullsone!

559
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Piano? How do you know?

560
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
