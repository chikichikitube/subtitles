1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Thank you for coming!

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
It's a real pleasure.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Don't worry, don't worry.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
It's a bit late to start, right?

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Yes.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
This is completely because of Yamazaki.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Why?

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
That kid was so excited.

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Oh, is that so?

10
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
He was so excited.

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Why?

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
He said he slept through something.

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Is this the time to sleep through something?

14
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
He didn't sleep through anything the day before.

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
He didn't sleep through anything, did he?

16
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
No, no, no.

17
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
This program is brought to you by the following sponsors.

18
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
If he gets angry, I'm going to hit him with a Fanta Grape.

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
That's a good idea.

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I have something interesting to tell you.

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:53,000
What is it?

22
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
It looks like I punched him.

23
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Koichi Wajima!

24
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
It's an interesting story.

25
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
A junior from Yoshimoto.

26
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
He's a very interesting junior.

27
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
A very young guy.

28
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
He's going to a classroom right now.

29
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
It's an interesting place.

30
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
It's on the street.

31
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
When he's on the street, the instructor...

32
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
What's that?

33
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
It's like a digital camera.

34
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
It's like a digital camera.

35
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Like you're watching it while teaching?

36
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
While teaching.

37
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
When he's done teaching,

38
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
they're all going to watch it on a big screen.

39
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
They're going to watch it?

40
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
They're going to watch it.

41
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I thought it was interesting.

42
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Miura was driving.

43
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Miura-kun...

44
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Miura was driving.

45
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Miura-kun.

46
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Miura-kun.

47
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Miura-kun.

48
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Miura-kun.

49
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Miura-kun.

50
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Miura-kun.

51
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:56,000
When I was going to work at Jaguar, I didn't know anything about it.

52
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I was like, I don't know anything about it!

53
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I don't know anything about it!

54
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I don't know anything about it!

55
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
And after that class,

56
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Everyone, look at this. This is Miura-kun's.

57
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Miura-kun, take a picture of this.

58
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Or, this is Mach-chan's.

59
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
This is Mach-chan's.

60
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
This is the driver's seat.

61
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
This is Mach-chan's.

62
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I know it's Mach-chan's, but I don't know if this is Mach-chan's.

63
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
He said, this is Mach-chan's.

64
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
That's great.

65
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
That's what he said.

66
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
But that's terrible.

67
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
But it's a fun game.

68
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
It's a fun game, but...

69
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
This is a lie.

70
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
That's right.

71
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I'm counting on you.

72
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
No, no, no.

73
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
There are a lot of things like that.

74
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I see.

75
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Please do it well.

76
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I know you failed the third time.

77
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Failed?

78
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
It's always like this.

79
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
What do you mean, please do it well?

80
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Even if you failed the third time.

81
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
It's always like this.

82
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I don't really want to say this on TV, but

83
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
My grandmother

84
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
She's into haiku lately.

85
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I don't mind.

86
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
She's going to a haiku club.

87
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I don't mind.

88
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I don't mind if she goes to a haiku club, but

89
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
She sent me a letter.

90
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
She wrote a haiku?

91
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
There are about 40 haiku.

92
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
What do you want her to do?

93
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I want her to read it to me.

94
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
When I read it in the middle of the night,

95
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I thought she was going crazy.

96
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I thought she was going to be a fool.

97
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
It's terrible.

98
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
What kind of haiku?

99
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I remembered it.

100
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
It's not that terrible.

101
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
It's not that terrible.

102
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
There were a lot of terrible things.

103
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I was quite surprised.

104
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Heart attack and

105
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,000
The suspense of love and tears.

106
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I don't know what it means.

107
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I thought she was going to be a fool.

108
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
She's serious.

109
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
It's not that. I thought she was going to be a fool.

110
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I was surprised.

111
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
It's all like that, right?

112
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
It's not all like that.

113
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
There was a beautiful one.

114
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Poiste's

115
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
The bird that dances in the autumn.

116
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I don't know if it's beautiful.

117
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
There are 40 of them, and that's it.

118
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
It's terrible after that.

119
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,000
There is no mother to send carnations.

120
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
It's sad.

121
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
It's sad.

122
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
But that's fine.

123
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Who are you talking about?

124
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
It's like you're threatening me.

125
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
That's not good.

126
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
What are you talking about?

127
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
But I understand.

128
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
It's scary.

129
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I thought it was done.

130
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I thought it was done.

131
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
How about you?

132
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I'm surprised.

133
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Send me more.

134
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
There are a lot.

135
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I threw it away.

136
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:25,000
It was a love that I picked up in high school.

137
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
No, no, no, no.

138
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
When are you talking about?

139
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
About yourself?

140
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
It's creepy.

141
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
It's scary.

142
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:41,000
A woman who is close to 70 years old says that to her 40-year-old son.

143
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
When did you throw it away?

144
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
It's creepy.

145
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
How did you pick it up?

146
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
It's creepy.

147
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,000
It's creepy just to pick it up.

148
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
You're the only one on TV that's creepy.

149
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I've known you since elementary school.

150
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
It's creepy.

151
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
It's really creepy.

152
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
It's really creepy.

153
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
So I threw it away once.

154
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
What's that?

155
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
It's not Jouichi.

156
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
It's not Jouichi.

157
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
There's such a dirty love.

158
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,000
It seems that there is a place where you immediately stab it.

159
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
He said it himself.

160
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
He said I stab it right away.

161
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I said it when I was in elementary school.

162
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I don't understand the meaning.

163
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I don't understand the meaning.

164
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
My mother said there is such a place.

165
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
It's the same thing.

166
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
It's the same thing.

167
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Shut up.

168
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Don't say it.

169
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Don't say it.

170
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I don't understand.

171
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I'm surprised.

172
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I'll tell you when it comes.

173
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
It says 100,000.

174
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I thought it was 40,000 for the time being.

175
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
It says there's still more.

176
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
There's still more.

177
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
It's a yoga katakana.

178
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
It has a surprise mark.

179
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I thought there was still more.

180
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
It's better to announce it on that day.

181
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
It's a waste.

182
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
It's better to announce it all.

183
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I'm surprised.

184
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
What should we do today?

185
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:30,000
We have to play a penalty game today.

186
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:44,000
The losing team, please come out.

187
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
It's really a sleeping face.

188
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
It's amazing.

189
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
What are you doing?

190
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I quit.

191
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Really?

192
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Really.

193
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I'm glad you quit.

194
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Why did you quit?

195
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I was setting up the room.

196
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
It's hot.

197
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
It's hot.

198
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I didn't do it on purpose.

199
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I'm sorry.

200
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
You wake up so soon.

201
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I'm sleepy.

202
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
It's sunny.

203
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
You slept too much.

204
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
What time did you sleep?

205
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
It was 9 o'clock in the morning.

206
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
At work?

207
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Didn't you sleep?

208
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I'm on a TV show called Fandango TV.

209
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I'm addicted to it.

210
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
You're on the show.

211
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
That's right.

212
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
You're on the show.

213
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I'm on the show, but it's fun to watch.

214
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
You're on the show all the time.

215
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I'm on the show all the time.

216
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
You're on the show all the time.

217
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I'm a junior.

218
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Why am I in between the two of you?

219
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
You're really strong.

220
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Please let me do it.

221
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I don't know why.

222
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
That's a strange position.

223
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
It's fine.

224
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
It's fine.

225
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
It's fine.

226
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
It's fine.

227
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
It's fine.

228
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
It's fine.

229
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
What are you doing?

230
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
There are various days.

231
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
The penalty game will be held next month.

232
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
That's right.

233
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
It's about winter.

234
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
That's right.

235
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
It's harder in winter.

236
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I'll do it with the momentum to kill you.

237
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I'm going to kill you.

238
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I'll do it next month.

239
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I don't know the meaning of the penalty.

240
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Why?

241
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Everyone is having fun bowling.

242
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
It's easy.

243
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Everyone will go on a hot spring trip this time.

244
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
On a hot spring trip?

245
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Yes.

246
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Two days and one night.

247
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Yes.

248
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
That's all.

249
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Is that okay?

250
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Yes.

251
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I understand.

252
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
It's not a penalty at all.

253
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Is it okay?

254
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
It's okay.

255
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Why didn't you tell me in detail?

256
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
You guys should go to the hot spring.

257
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Do you know what's going on?

258
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
That's a strange position.

259
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Something is going on.

260
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
What does it look like?

261
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
What does it look like?

262
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
It's two days and one night.

263
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I'm going to stay overnight.

264
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,000
But I can't sleep.

265
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
You can't sleep?

266
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I can't sleep.

267
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
What do you mean you can't sleep?

268
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I can't sleep because it hurts.

269
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
What?

270
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I don't like it.

271
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I'll tell you one thing.

272
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
There's a tie.

273
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:46,000
People who are watching TV may think it's funny.

274
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I'm going to play a lot of tricks.

275
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Please don't laugh.

276
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Please don't laugh at what I'm going to play.

277
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
People who are watching TV, please laugh a lot.

278
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:03,000
But if you guys laugh...

279
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Well, there's something.

280
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
The four of us are going to the hot spring, right?

281
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Why are we going to the hot spring?

282
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I'm scared.

283
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I can do anything to lock you guys up in the building.

284
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Can you lock us up?

285
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Of course.

286
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I'll make sure you don't run away.

287
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:34,000
As I've said many times, I just had fun bowling.

288
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
It was a lot of fun.

289
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
If there was a strike, there was a guard.

290
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I couldn't stop laughing.

291
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
It was a lot of fun.

292
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I don't know why people do that.

293
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I'll let you go to the hotel.

294
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I can do anything.

295
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
If you don't laugh, it's over.

296
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
You can't laugh because you're a professional.

297
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
That's right.

298
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
If you don't laugh, there's nothing.

299
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
You can go back to the hot spring.

300
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
That's right.

301
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
If you don't laugh, it's over.

302
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
If you don't laugh, it's over.

303
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:08,000
If you laugh instead...

304
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I can't stay with you forever.

305
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Why?

306
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I'll be punished.

307
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
If I go out with you.

308
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Why are you being so mean?

309
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I don't like it.

310
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I'll go when I can.

311
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I'll go when I can.

312
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I'll be watching you guys.

313
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I don't know if I'll be on the show.

314
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
When I'm on the show, I'll do a lot more than usual.

315
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I'm the one who bought it.

316
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I think...

317
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I don't think it's right for all four of us to be punished.

318
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Why?

319
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I see.

320
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
From now on...

321
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I see.

322
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Can I ask you a question?

323
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Why are you doing this?

324
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I don't know.

325
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I don't know.

326
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I really don't know.

327
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Please tell me why.

328
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
You didn't tell me earlier?

329
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
What do you mean?

330
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Well, I see.

331
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
What do you mean?

332
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Well, there were some bad guys bowling.

333
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

334
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I see.

335
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
And then there's the loser and the loner, right?

336
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
What are you talking about?

337
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Why are you wearing so many socks?

338
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
That's a lot.

339
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
What?

340
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Well, there are some bad guys who couldn't bowl properly.

341
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
That's true.

342
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
So the four of us are going to lose our eyes.

343
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,000
So I think it's okay to narrow it down to one or two people.

344
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I'm actually on your side.

345
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
You're on my side, aren't you?

346
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
You're on my side.

347
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I'm on the red side.

348
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I think that's what it is.

349
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:59,000
That's because the times are the worst for us.

350
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

351
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
No, no, the times are the worst for us.

352
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
We're on the red side right now.

353
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Oh, you guys are on the red side.

354
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
So we can't be reckless.

355
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
No, no, no, no.

356
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
You can be reckless.

357
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
You can do anything.

358
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Are you stupid?

359
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,000
From now on, you guys can stop.

360
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
You have kids, right?

361
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
No, we don't.

362
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Why didn't I do it alone?

363
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
What?

364
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
We don't know.

365
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
It's not just the two of us. It's a group.

366
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
It's already decided.

367
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
What are you talking about?

368
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Then let's do it with five people.

369
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
What are you fighting for?

370
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
No, no, what are you talking about?

371
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
It's okay.

372
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I want to do a lot of things.

373
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
It's okay.

374
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Then let's do it with one person.

375
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Why me?

376
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
You're the most normal person.

377
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
What kind of person am I?

378
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
What kind of person am I?

379
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
You wake up and it's a mess.

380
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Can't you talk?

381
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
It's a big deal.

382
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
It's like a dog.

383
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
It's like a death-throwing game.

384
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
It's a mess.

385
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I mean, I'm looking forward to it.

386
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I can't let you do such a stupid thing.

387
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
There's nothing around you.

388
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I don't hear any screams.

389
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Someone's coming to help.

390
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I don't want to lose to this team again.

391
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
In the future?

392
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I don't want to lose to this team again.

393
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Why?

394
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I was doing something really good.

395
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
What?

396
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,000
There's no such thing as who's good or who's bad.

397
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I don't want to lose to this team.

398
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Let's change it next time.

399
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Then I'll do it with one person.

400
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
This team versus this team.

401
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Are you serious?

402
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
If you lose, it won't be funny anymore.

403
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:23,000
First of all, let's get a divorce.

404
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I haven't been punished much by Hamada, though.

405
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
That's too much.

406
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
You're too much.

407
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Get yourself together on the day.

408
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
That's right.

409
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Tell the person who's going to get a divorce to get a divorce properly.

410
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:56,000
There was a place you went to before, right?

411
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
It was a place that made you feel nervous.

412
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
That's right.

413
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I know this time.

414
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I'm just saying that if you're nervous, there's something.

415
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
But people laugh, right?

416
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,000
There are times when people laugh even when they're talking to you.

417
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
We're talking normally, right?

418
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Like smiling.

419
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
That's why it's selling, right?

420
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
We're not doing anything.

421
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
We're just having fun.

422
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I'll judge that status.

423
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I just laughed.

424
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I'm a little bad.

425
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Can't you do this?

426
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I'm laughing.

427
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
You can't do that.

428
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
What? But I can do it forever.

429
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
You can't do it forever. You will be beaten forever.

430
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
What?

431
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Forever?

432
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
No, no, no.

433
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
About 20%.

434
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
You will be beaten.

435
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
What?

436
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
You can't beat me.

437
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
You can't beat me.

438
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
That's also a detail.

439
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
That's not good.

440
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
You will be beaten.

441
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
No, no, no.

442
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Make a serious face.

443
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
This is fine.

444
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
That's fine.

445
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
You're smiling?

446
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Yes, I am.

447
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
You're smiling?

448
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Yes, I am.

449
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
That's fine.

450
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
It's fine, right?

451
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
No.

452
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
It's really fine.

453
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
You have bad eyes.

454
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
You have bad eyes.

455
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
You have bad eyes.

456
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
That's what I'm saying too.

457
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
You have bad eyes.

458
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
No, I don't.

459
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
That's normal.

460
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
That's not good...

461
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Yes, okay.

462
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
That's all.

463
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
You will be beaten.

464
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
What?

465
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I'm scared.

466
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
I'm scared!

467
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
You're not laughing at all.

468
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
No, I'm not.

469
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Don't laugh at me.

470
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
It's a punishment game!

471
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Let's do it when you can see his teeth.

472
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
No, I can't see his teeth when I laugh.

473
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I can't do it when I can see his teeth.

474
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,000
If you do something so harsh, I'll complain.

475
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Fine.

476
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I can't do it when I can see his teeth, right?

477
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
You're so strong.

478
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I said it's fine if you don't laugh.

479
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
You're so kind.

480
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I can't do it if you don't laugh.

481
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
But people will laugh.

482
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
What's wrong with that?

483
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
It's something that only humans have been given.

484
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
That's right.

485
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
That's right.

486
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I really thought so.

487
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
What are you talking about?

488
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I can't go anymore.

489
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
What?

490
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
What do you mean you can't go?

491
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I can't go to the set.

492
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
I'm sorry.

493
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
I'm sorry.

494
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I'm sorry.

495
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Everyone knows.

496
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Everyone, please look forward to it.

497
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:51,000
I think it's going to be interesting.

498
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
What?

499
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Right?

500
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
What is this?

501
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
What?

502
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
You're a good tiger.

503
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
That's right.

504
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I'm scared.

505
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
I'm scared.

506
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I'm scared.

507
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I'm scared.

508
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I cried.

509
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
That's a prank.

510
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Poor thing.

511
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
You don't have to shoot a batminton racket.

512
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
But you shoot this.

513
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
He's in trouble.

514
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,000
I thought I'd cut it and do it like that.

515
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Just...

516
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Just...

517
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
No.

518
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I'm sorry.

519
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I'm sorry.

520
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
I'm sorry.

521
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:44,120
What are you doing, fur-san?

522
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,080
Huh?

523
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:48,760
Hey suck my ear.

524
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:57,960
This is sick.

525
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,680
Hey I'm not kidding.

526
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,680
I can't do this anymore.

527
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,680
I can't do this anymore.

528
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,680
I can't do this anymore.

529
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,680
That's right.

530
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,680
But this time there are four of us, so it's fine.

531
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,680
It's not like I'm going to focus only on you.

532
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,680
We're all going to do it together.

533
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,680
That's right. I'm going to focus on the person who laughs.

534
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,680
But Hamada-kun, you know...

535
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,680
What do you mean, Hamada-kun?

536
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,680
We've been through a lot together, haven't we?

537
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,680
That's right.

538
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:29,680
That's right.

539
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,680
That happened to me too.

540
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,680
It's not like they're related.

541
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,680
No, no, no.

542
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:44,680
It's been 13 years, right, Hamada-san?

543
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,680
Right? Our relationship.

544
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,680
That's right.

545
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,680
If I say 13 years, it's a long time.

546
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,680
But I only met you at the scene.

547
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:52,680
That's right.

548
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,680
Endo and Hamada-san...

549
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,680
When I was in middle school,

550
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,680
I saw the first 4 o'clock news.

551
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,680
That's right.

552
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:04,680
That's right.

553
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:07,680
I went to the Nijomi theater.

554
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:10,680
I was cheering for Hama-chan.

555
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,680
At that time, it was Hama-chan.

556
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,680
Now it's Hamada-san, of course.

557
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,680
I said, Hama-chan, Hama-chan.

558
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:17,680
I said Hama-chan to everyone.

559
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,680
I said Hama-chan in school.

560
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,680
Yes.

561
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:23,680
When I went to Karaoke, I sang the first song.

562
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,680
You sang.

563
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:25,680
Endo sang.

564
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,680
I sang all the songs.

565
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,680
Oh, by the way,

566
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:30,680
I bought 4 Otsu Nights.

567
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,680
Oh, 4?

568
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,680
But...

569
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,680
That's going to happen.

570
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,680
I bought 4 Otsu Nights.

571
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,680
I want another one.

572
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:43,680
Let's go home.

573
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,680
Let's go home.

574
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:47,680
Let's go home.

575
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,680
Let's go home.

576
00:22:49,680 --> 00:23:17,680
Let's go home.
