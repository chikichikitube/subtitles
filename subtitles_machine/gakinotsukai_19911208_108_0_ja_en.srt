1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
I don't want to see it in the kids' room.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Tsukitsugi Ogiri University!

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Good evening, everyone.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I'm the head of the Kadakuchi Association, the Soviet Union.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Nice to meet you.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Let's call in our young girl.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Hanashika, please come in.

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Let's introduce ourselves.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Let's play a game.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Let's start from here.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Okay.

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
You bet with me.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Carrot and rabbit.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
What about that heart?

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I have a name.

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Moe!

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Name!

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Aozora Yohji.

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
What is it?

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Okay, you.

21
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I bet with you that I'll make a story.

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Yes.

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'll solve it with Mr. Hamada's daily life.

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
What about that heart?

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I won't do it in a place where there are no people.

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
What?

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I bet with Aozora Yohji.

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Carrot and rabbit!

29
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Next!

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I bet with my friend in AD.

31
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I'll solve it with Hamada Masatoshi.

32
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
What about that heart?

33
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I'll do my best, so you do your best, too.

34
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Next!

35
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I bet with...

36
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I'll solve it with Maki.

37
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
What about that heart?

38
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I'll do my best, so you do your best, too.

39
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Okay, last one.

40
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Let's go.

41
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I bet with...

42
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I'll solve it with Yoshinoya's beef bowl.

43
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
What about that heart?

44
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I don't like women very much.

45
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I bet with Katsura Utanda.

46
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Okay, nice to meet you.

47
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Next!

48
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I bet with Ayu-e!

49
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I bet with Ayu-e!

50
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
There are five characters in Ayu-e.

51
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I'll fold them and let you talk about that person.

52
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
First of all...

53
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Mr. Katsura.

54
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Mr. Katsura. Let's go with A-gyo.

55
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Okay?

56
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I bet with Ayu-e.

57
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Ah!

58
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
You always wear a red dress.

59
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Let's talk about Nihon TV.

60
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
What is it?

61
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Let's go with Sa-gyo.

62
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Let's go with Sa-gyo.

63
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Sa-gyo is the best company.

64
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,000
It's a TV show about UFOs and ghosts.

65
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Su!

66
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Mr. Su is a good producer, but...

67
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
What are you doing?

68
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
This is not a good place.

69
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Se!

70
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
There are many sex-lovers.

71
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
That's not a good place.

72
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Su!

73
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
There are many sex-lovers.

74
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
That's not a good place.

75
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I bet with Nihon TV.

76
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
What is it?

77
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
There are many sex-lovers.

78
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
There are many sex-lovers in Nihon TV.

79
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
That's right.

80
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Really?

81
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
It's true.

82
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Let's go with this.

83
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I'm sorry to say this, but...

84
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
It's a child.

85
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Let's go with this.

86
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Let's go with Sa-gyo.

87
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Sa-gyo?

88
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Yes.

89
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Sa-gyo?

90
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Sa-gyo?

91
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Sa-gyo?

92
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Sa-gyo?

93
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Sa-gyo?

94
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Sa-gyo?

95
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Sa-gyo?

96
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Sa-gyo?

97
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Ki!

98
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Ki!

99
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Catch the tight wife!

100
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Ku!

101
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Your lips are drooping down, but...

102
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Don't say that!

103
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Ke!

104
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
The more your pores open, the more...

105
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Ku!

106
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
The more your pores open, the more...

107
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Don't say that!

108
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Don't say that!

109
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
The second one!

110
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
The second one! Read the Atatamo!

111
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Now, are you ready?

112
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Here it is.

113
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
It's a book about how to draw animals.

114
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I haven't drawn anything yet.

115
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I wonder if Atatamo is already drawn.

116
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Let's read it.

117
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
What kind of drawing should I do?

118
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
What is it?

119
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Hamster!

120
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I can't believe it's a hamster.

121
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Yohji-kun.

122
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Yes.

123
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
From Yohji-kun.

124
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:43,000
The reason why I met this hamster Tsubochibo-kun

125
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
It's a book about how to draw!

126
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
It's a book about how to draw!

127
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
It's a novel!

128
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Who's drawing it?

129
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I'm drawing it.

130
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
What?

131
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
It's really good!

132
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Read it!

133
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
The real way to draw is...

134
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
What is it?

135
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,000
If you buy it at the aquarium...

136
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
It's a good thing.

137
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
It's different from before.

138
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
There's food!

139
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Let's stop there.

140
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
It's different from before!

141
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
There's food!

142
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
What is it?

143
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Food is...

144
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I like small hippos.

145
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
But everyone, let's think about it here.

146
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Let's draw three hamsters in Chinese.

147
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Okay, stop there.

148
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I see.

149
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Let's draw three hamsters in Chinese.

150
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Before I draw it in Chinese...

151
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I said let's draw it!

152
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I have to explain it.

153
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I already drew it.

154
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Before I draw it,

155
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I have to talk about the history of the aquarium.

156
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I'll talk about the history of the aquarium in the cross.

157
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I see.

158
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I'll talk about the history of the aquarium in the cross.

159
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
In the saying of Chaya Shirojirou...

160
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
In the saying?

161
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
In the saying...

162
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I don't know the pace.

163
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:32,000
What kind of sound did the third hamster make?

164
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
What is it?

165
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
This is from a long time ago.

166
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
There was a fishmonger who went to the fishmonger's room.

167
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Like this.

168
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
What kind of sound did it make?

169
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
It was like this.

170
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Yes!

171
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Let's start with Yohji, whose voice is hoarse.

172
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,000
The owner of the rice shop is worried.

173
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Ah, I'm sorry.

174
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
What kind of sound did it make?

175
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
What kind of sound did it make?

176
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I'm sorry.

177
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Hey, Hoka!

178
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Yes?

179
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
You guys are hopeless.

180
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Look at me.

181
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Saejo Hideki is worried!

182
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Oh!

183
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Oh!

184
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Ladies and gentlemen.

185
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
It was really hard today.

186
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Yes, it was really hard.

187
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Let's go home shortly.

188
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Let's go home.

189
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
It has nothing to do with you guys.

190
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
You guys should die.

191
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
You have to go home early and make your own time.

192
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Is that so?

193
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I really don't have my own time.

194
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I used to be the head of a gang.

195
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Are you kidding me?

196
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I miss it.

197
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
You don't even have a gas station license.

198
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
You can't even ride a big car.

199
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I really miss that time.

200
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I did a lot of bad things.

201
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I liked it more than Kenkawa-san's name.

202
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I really did a lot of bad things.

203
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I'm glad I did that.

204
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Oh, against the enemy.

205
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Yes.

206
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Against the Black Jaguars.

207
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
When you're surrounded by 30 people.

208
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Even as a good leader.

209
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Even as a good leader.

210
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:01,000
It's true that you can shake things up.

211
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
How did you handle it?

212
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
What do you mean?

213
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
30 people surrounded you.

214
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Yes.

215
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
What did you do?

216
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
You should have been scared.

217
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
That's right.

218
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
You should have been scared.

219
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
What did you do?

220
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Stop it!

221
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I'm not going to stop at that.

222
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I won't stop at that.

223
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I won't stop at that.

224
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I'm going to turn my back on them.

225
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
But even if I think I should stop,

226
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I can't stop because I'm the leader.

227
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
That's right.

228
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
The leader over there is strong.

229
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
The leader over there was strong too.

230
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Do you know that guy?

231
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Oh, Kawachi.

232
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Oh, Kawachi.

233
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Oh, Kawachi.

234
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Ohkawachi!

235
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Ohkawachi is also a big deal.

236
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Ohkawachi?

237
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
You said, stop it!

238
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Ohkawachi said, go!

239
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I didn't expect that kind of attack.

240
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
That's why I said, fly!

241
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I said, say that!

242
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:12,000
It started to spin.

243
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:18,000
30 people started to spin.

244
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Oh!

245
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Then?

246
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Then?

247
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I didn't expect that kind of attack.

248
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I said, say that!

249
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I said, say that!

250
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Say it now!

251
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Say it right now!

252
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I said, go!

253
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I waited too long.

254
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
It's like this.

255
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
It's like this.

256
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Why do you care about the camera?

257
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I want to show it to you.

258
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
It's like this.

259
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
It's terrible.

260
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
It's terrible.

261
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Then?

262
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,000
It's terrible!

263
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I said it.

264
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
But you didn't stop it.

265
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I didn't stop it.

266
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Why didn't you stop it?

267
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I said it like that.

268
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I said it like that.

269
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I was scared.

270
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I was scared.

271
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Really?

272
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
It was terrible.

273
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Then?

274
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I was there.

275
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Leave it to me!

276
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I said it!

277
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
But you know, in high school,

278
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
we were weak.

279
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
We were weak.

280
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
We had to go to the toilet.

281
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
We had to take the girls.

282
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
We didn't know what to do.

283
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
They were so strong.

284
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
They were so strong.

285
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
We were so scared.

286
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
We were so weak.

287
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
We were walking with a girl.

288
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
It was like a department store.

289
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
There was a woman there.

290
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
She was so mean.

291
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
She was so mean.

292
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I had to cut her noodles.

293
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I was cutting her noodles.

294
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I had to cut her noodles too.

295
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
You were watching that.

296
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Leave it to me.

297
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
She has to climb down the stairs.

298
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I understand.

299
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
She had to climb up the stairs.

300
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I was climbing down the stairs.

301
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I was climbing up the stairs.

302
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
There was a lot ofifferences between us.

303
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Leave it to me!

304
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Put my head down.

305
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
We've already parted ways.

306
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
We'll never meet again.

307
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I think it's okay to get a little drunk.

308
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I think it's okay.

309
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I think so too.

310
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
And when I got off the bus, there were a lot of electronic products.

311
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
And she was just lying there, looking at me like this.

312
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
She was looking at me.

313
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
And then that guy...

314
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
He came in, so I had to come in!

315
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I couldn't stand it!

316
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
What do you mean, you came in?

317
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
What do you mean, you came in?

318
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
You came in, you came in!

319
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
What kind of clothes was he wearing?

320
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
He was wearing a cardigan with a Ushite-ella-like collar.

321
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
He was wearing a cardigan with a Ushite-ella-like collar.

322
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Yeah.

323
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
He was wearing something red.

324
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Yeah.

325
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Yeah.

326
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
That was in vogue!

327
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
He wasn't wearing a belt.

328
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
He wore a pair of rubber-lipped panties.

329
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
He wore a pair of rubber-lipped panties.

330
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Okay, okay.

331
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
And he looked like a short guy with long legs.

332
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
And he was wearing women's slippers.

333
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Women's slippers?

334
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
He was wearing women's sandals.

335
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
It was gross.

336
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
And he asked me, what are you doing Kristoff?

337
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Your girl is listening to you?

338
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Yes, she is.

339
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Oh, she is telling you?

340
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Yes, she is.

341
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
What?

342
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Well, she looks like a girl I know.

343
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
What?

344
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
You're lying!

345
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
My girl is lying!

346
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
You're cute.

347
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
You're good at lying.

348
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I'm telling the truth.

349
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Who are you?

350
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I'm in love with electrical appliances.

351
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Who are you?

352
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I'm scared of these things.

353
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I don't want to get hit in front of a girl.

354
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
It's tough.

355
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
It's tough.

356
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I don't want to get hit in front of a girl.

357
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I'm already in love with you.

358
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I don't want to get hit in front of a girl.

359
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Well, let's talk over there.

360
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Hey, come here.

361
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
You're so strong.

362
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I told her to wait for me.

363
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
And I made her wait.

364
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I was hoping that she wouldn't do anything until I got there.

365
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I didn't care what she did.

366
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I just wanted her to do something in front of a girl.

367
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
On the way.

368
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
On the way.

369
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I was walking ahead of her.

370
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Oh, you're here.

371
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I was walking ahead of her.

372
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I told her not to turn to that corner.

373
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I told her to follow me safely.

374
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
When I was about to turn around,

375
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
She was kicking me in the ass.

376
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
She was kicking me in the ass.

377
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
She was kicking me in the ass.

378
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Shut up.

379
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
She saw me, didn't she?

380
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
She was just looking at me.

381
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
What do you think of Hayashi?

382
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:13,600
You know, I have a lot of

383
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
You know, I have a lot of

384
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I like to watch you.

385
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I usually introduce things that are interesting.

386
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Sometimes, you see, there are a few letters that say,

387
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
What is the purpose of this child?

388
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I introduced about two today.

389
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Who stands out the most among your family?

390
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,000
What made him do that?

391
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I've never thought about that.

392
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I wrote that with a pencil.

393
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
It's strange, isn't it?

394
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
It's strange.

395
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
It's really strange.

396
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I think this is the same person.

397
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Where is the place where you can relax at home?

398
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:17,000
It's strange, isn't it?

399
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Why do you ask that?

400
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Did you know that?

401
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I don't know.

402
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
For example, if you say it's a living room,

403
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Oh, there are amazing people in the world.

404
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
For some reason, even if you make friends in the same class,

405
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Even if you pass each other in the hallway for a year,

406
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
It's like passing by a dead end.

407
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I see.

408
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Why have you two been friends for a long time?

409
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Or do you hate each other?

410
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Please answer.

411
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Pen name, Ucchan Love.

412
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Ask Ucchan.

413
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I'm worried if I can understand this.

414
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Really?

415
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
If you don't see each other for a while,

416
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Even though you were so close,

417
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
It's hard to talk to each other.

418
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Really?

419
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
You talk to anyone.

420
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:24,000
This is his strength and weakness.

421
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
You talk to anyone.

422
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
That's right.

423
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
If I didn't have anyone, I would talk to Shoukaki.

424
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I would talk to White.

425
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I can't talk about this on TV anymore.

426
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I couldn't stand it.

427
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
But I'll stop it.

428
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I'll stop it.

429
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Don't laugh.

430
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
It's true.

431
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
It's okay.

432
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
It's okay.

433
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I'll laugh like this.

434
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:02,000
We weren't that close friends in high school.

435
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
At that time,

436
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
As it is now,

437
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
In the TV game center,

438
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
It was the time before the invasion of the invaders.

439
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:15,000
We weren't invaders, but I knew the game.

440
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
What?

441
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
There was something like that.

442
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
What is that?

443
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
It's okay.

444
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
It wasn't a sound.

445
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
What is that?

446
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
There was something like that.

447
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Galaga.

448
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Galaga.

449
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Don't speak so loudly.

450
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Galaga.

451
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
It was here.

452
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
It was there.

453
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
When I was doing Galaga,

454
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
My friend said,

455
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Long time no see.

456
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I sat on the chair.

457
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Galaga.

458
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Galaga.

459
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Galaga.

460
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
It's not good to die now.

461
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Galaga.

462
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Galaga.

463
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Galaga.

464
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Long time no see.

465
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
How are you doing?

466
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Well,

467
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Where did you get a job?

468
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
The printing company?

469
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Yes.

470
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
The company?

471
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Yes.

472
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
First of all,

473
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I...

474
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I...

475
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
What should I do?

476
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
If Galaga dies now,

477
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I'm sorry.

478
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I don't know what to do.

479
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I don't know what to do.

480
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
What should I do?

481
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Don't say anything weird.

482
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Be careful.

483
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
So,

484
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
It's funny,

485
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
I want to talk about it.

486
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
You know what I mean?

487
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Well,

488
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Is it okay?

489
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Yes.

490
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Is it enough?

491
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
A little more?

492
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Galaga was doing it.

493
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Is it enough?

494
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Is it enough?

495
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
I want to broadcast it.

496
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
What?

497
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Did something happen?

498
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
A lot of things happened.

499
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
I didn't have such a good friend.

500
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Yes.

501
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
I...

502
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I played a game.

503
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
I haven't seen you for a long time.

504
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Well,

505
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Invader is popular.

506
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Well,

507
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
What is it?

508
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
What is it?

509
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Pyon, pyon, pyon, pyon.

510
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
I knew it by the sound.

511
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
What is it?

512
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Invader...

513
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Galaga!

514
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Galaga!

515
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Shut up!

516
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Shut up!

517
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,000
I was there in the past.

518
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I played it.

519
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Yes.

520
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
I played it.

521
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
I had a friend.

522
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Yes.

523
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I said,

524
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
It's been a long time.

525
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
You shouldn't do that.

526
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I said,

527
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
It's been a long time.

528
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Pyon, pyon, pyon, pyon.

529
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
I said,

530
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
What are you doing?

531
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
What are you doing?

532
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Are you doing well?

533
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Yes.

534
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
I'm doing well.

535
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Did you have a job?

536
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Yes.

537
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Well,

538
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
I...

539
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Matsumoto...

540
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Pyon, pyon, pyon, pyon.

541
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
What are you doing?

542
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Pyon, pyon, pyon, pyon.

543
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
I have such a good ear.

544
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:29,000
I have such a good ear.
