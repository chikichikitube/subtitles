1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
What do you mean by that?

2
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
We will now begin the trial.

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Defendant, please enter.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:28,000
What is this?

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
What is this?

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
We will now begin the trial of the case against Hamada downtown.

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
The defendant will defend himself, so please take your seats.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
You guys are so stupid.

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Defendant, please enter.

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
What is this?

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
There is no doubt that it is Hamada Masato-san.

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Shut up! You can tell by looking at him.

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
So it is Osaka dialect after all.

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
You always say that you haven't done plastic surgery.

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I said I haven't done it!

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
So there is no doubt?

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I haven't done it.

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I haven't been asked anything.

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I haven't been asked anything.

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I haven't been asked anything.

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I haven't been asked anything.

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I was brought here.

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
You are often on TV.

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
You too!

25
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
You have been on TV recently.

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You have been on TV recently.

27
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Do you know the famous actress Haruko Sagara?

28
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I know her.

29
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
She has a kissing scene in the drama.

30
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Haruko Sagara left a comment.

31
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I don't think so.

32
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I want you to see it.

33
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Test the evidence.

34
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Who the hell are you?

35
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I have been working with Yama-chan in the drama.

36
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,000
We are still close friends.

37
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
There was a kissing scene in the drama.

38
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
When I touched her lips,

39
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I could feel her lips.

40
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
It was like a resin.

41
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I couldn't feel her body temperature.

42
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
It was like a fake.

43
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
You didn't tell me!

44
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Hey, judge.

45
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
You didn't tell me.

46
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
You made me tell you.

47
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
No, I didn't.

48
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
As I have been told,

49
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,000
her lips are not real.

50
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
No, they are real.

51
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I want to talk about her lips.

52
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Judge, please look at this.

53
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:10,000
This is your recent photo.

54
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
You can't tell from this distance.

55
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:20,000
You zoom in and zoom out.

56
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
You can't tell from this distance.

57
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Wait!

58
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
You can't tell from this distance.

59
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I can't tell.

60
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
We almost gave up.

61
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Wait! Let's try one more time.

62
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
One more time.

63
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
What is this?

64
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Let me count.

65
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
108 needles.

66
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
You can tell from this distance.

67
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
It's strange.

68
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
108 needles.

69
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Why is it black?

70
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
You can't do this kind of bad surgery.

71
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,000
It's just the number of human instincts.

72
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
You can't tell from this distance.

73
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I can tell from this distance.

74
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
We did a lot of research.

75
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
You can't live without being hospitalized.

76
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,000
You have been hospitalized for about a week.

77
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
There is a photo.

78
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Really?

79
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Please look at this.

80
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
There is no such thing.

81
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
What is this?

82
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Wait!

83
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
You are scary.

84
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Why are you laughing at me?

85
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I was very happy that the surgery went well.

86
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I was very happy.

87
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Are you stupid?

88
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,000
You can't tell from this distance.

89
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I understand.

90
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Can I call the witness?

91
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Witness.

92
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Witness?

93
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Yes.

94
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Who is it?

95
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I see.

96
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
What are you doing?

97
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
What is this?

98
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
What is this?

99
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Thank you.

100
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Thank you.

101
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I often work with Mr. Hamada.

102
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
We take the bus together.

103
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,000
When I saw Mr. Hamada sleeping, I thought he was tired.

104
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Mr. Hamada was talking in his sleep.

105
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:37,000
He told me to fix my mouth again.

106
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I wondered what kind of dream he was having.

107
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I often go to drink with Mr. Hamada's apprentice.

108
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Mr. Hamada tells his apprentice something.

109
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:57,000
He always tells me that I have to get a plastic surgery to make a living as an entertainer.

110
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
You said it clearly.

111
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
When did you hear that?

112
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I don't have an apprentice.

113
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
That's a lie.

114
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
What kind of relationship do you have with him?

115
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
He told me that he was Mr. Hamada's apprentice.

116
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Do you have any evidence?

117
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Yes.

118
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Excuse me.

119
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
What do you mean?

120
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:30,000
When Mr. Hamada left Tokyo and I met him in my dream, I went to see him.

121
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
He called me and I went to the bathroom.

122
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
He told me to keep this.

123
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I kept this.

124
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I'm sorry.

125
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
What is this? Is it a piece of paper?

126
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Yes, it is.

127
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
What is this?

128
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
May I?

129
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Yes.

130
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
What is this?

131
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
This is the front lip.

132
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
What is this?

133
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:05,120
Is this a

134
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Thank you very much.

135
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Thank you very much.

136
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Don't you usually say something like that?

137
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
There are many things like this.

138
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
What are you talking about?

139
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:23,000
When I had a meal with him at work, the waitress said,

140
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I want you to change your mouth.

141
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I showed a strange reaction to that change of mouth.

142
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
What is that?

143
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I have another witness.

144
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
It's okay.

145
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Who are you?

146
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Who are you?

147
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Don't you know me?

148
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I'm a smoker in Shinjuku.

149
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I think it was three or four years ago.

150
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
He came to my store and said,

151
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Auntie, do you have a big mask?

152
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I gave him a big mask and he came to buy it.

153
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I gave him a big mask and he came to buy it.

154
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
At that time, the mask I sold was this.

155
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,000
This is a big deal to deceive.

156
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
How many masks do you have?

157
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Don't you know?

158
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Thank you very much.

159
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Is it just for that?

160
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I'm still wearing white.

161
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I haven't done it yet.

162
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Then, I would like to pursue a more psychological part.

163
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Is it okay?

164
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Charter-based molding judgment vote.

165
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Do you have such a thing?

166
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
You're just making it up.

167
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
First of all, let's see this.

168
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
If you go on a date.

169
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Date?

170
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
What is a date?

171
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I don't know that.

172
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I can't answer.

173
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,000
If you go on a date, do you go to an amusement park?

174
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I don't have much to ride.

175
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Yes.

176
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Was the first kiss your room?

177
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
No.

178
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Do you like coffee?

179
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
No.

180
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Are you molding your lips?

181
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
It's like this.

182
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:30,000
You...

183
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Show me other parts.

184
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Is it okay if I go into a big mess?

185
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Let's see this.

186
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
What is it?

187
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:46,000
This is Hamada Masato's skull.

188
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I showed this to an expert.

189
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I had him put meat on it.

190
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Then you can see the real Hamada's face.

191
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
If the real Hamada's face is different from the one you see now,

192
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
it means it's molded.

193
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:08,000
So I asked an expert to make the real Hamada.

194
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Hikobumi, come to the center.

195
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
If you go from here,

196
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Hamada Masato's face looks like this.

197
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:27,000
This is the real Hamada Masato.

198
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Why is it like this?

199
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
This is scary.

200
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Is it okay?

201
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
What?

202
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I will now give the verdict to the defendant, Hamada Masato.

203
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
The verdict is death sentence.

204
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
What?

205
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,000
What are you doing?

206
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
What are you doing?

207
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Stop it.

208
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Thank you very much.

209
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Ladies and gentlemen.

210
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
It's been two weeks.

211
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
What?

212
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
That's right.

213
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
What are you doing?

214
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
What are you doing?

215
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
It's been two weeks.

216
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
It's been two weeks.

217
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Are you not used to the audience today?

218
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
It's been a long time.

219
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Are you getting used to it?

220
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
It's not the first time I've seen it.

221
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I'm not impressed.

222
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Is that so?

223
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
You don't answer.

224
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I'm not old enough to be impressed.

225
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
That's right.

226
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I'll die in 50 years.

227
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
That's not true.

228
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
It's not important now.

229
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
It's hard.

230
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
What?

231
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
What?

232
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
You're having a hard time.

233
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I'm looking for it.

234
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
What's so hard about it?

235
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I don't think about it in advance.

236
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
That's right.

237
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
It's hard.

238
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
What?

239
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
What's the atmosphere like?

240
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
What?

241
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I was in a taxi.

242
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
There was a truck coming next to me.

243
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
It was a woman.

244
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
It was a bad place.

245
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
It was shaking.

246
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I drank a bottle of milk desperately.

247
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I'll drink it after I go to Thailand.

248
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
It's powdery.

249
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:54,000
And it's a bottle of milk.

250
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I laughed a little.

251
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Is that so?

252
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:06,000
That's right.

253
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
You're not a student anymore, are you?

254
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I'm not a student anymore.

255
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
All the customers here are working, right?

256
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
That's right.

257
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I'm not a student anymore.

258
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I want to work as a salaryman for about a year.

259
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Can you go to work at the same time every day?

260
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
What time is the company now?

261
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
It's 9 o'clock.

262
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Can you go to work at 9 o'clock?

263
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
It's 9 o'clock.

264
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I'm a celebrity.

265
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I can't go to work at 9 o'clock tomorrow.

266
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,000
But I have to go to work at 9 o'clock.

267
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Can you go to work at 9 o'clock?

268
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I'm a student, so I can go to work at 9 o'clock.

269
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
If I get on the train, I can't go to work at 9 o'clock.

270
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Is that true?

271
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
That's right.

272
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
It's hard.

273
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I want to fall in love in the car.

274
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I want to fall in love in the car at my age.

275
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
There is such a thing.

276
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I can't go to work at 9 o'clock.

277
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Is that true?

278
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I don't say such a thing.

279
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
That's true.

280
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
That's a good thing.

281
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Is that so?

282
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:44,000
If you work in the same workplace, do you go out?

283
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Yes.

284
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Do you make a phone call?

285
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Yes.

286
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Do you call your mother?

287
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I don't do such a thing.

288
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
It's fun.

289
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I have only one paper, but I can copy many papers.

290
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
It's fun to laugh.

291
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I have an accident once.

292
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I have been driving a car for more than 10 years.

293
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I have an accident once.

294
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
No.

295
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I was spinning in the parking lot.

296
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I was in a good mood.

297
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I was in a good mood.

298
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I have an accident once.

299
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,000
I was in a good mood.

300
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
What is it?

301
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
It's a car accident.

302
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
It's a car accident.

303
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Why do I usually get a car accident?

304
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I resist it.

305
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I have been hit many times.

306
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I have never been hit by a car accident.

307
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
That's not true.

308
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I have been hit by a car accident once before.

309
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
When I got off the car, I was in a bad mood.

310
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I was in a bad mood.

311
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Why?

312
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Why are you hitting me?

313
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I don't know.

314
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I was in a bad mood.

315
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I was in a bad mood.

316
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Go.

317
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Go.

318
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Why do you resist it?

319
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
It has nothing to do with me.

320
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Go.

321
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
What are you doing?

322
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
This is my coat.

323
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I will write.

324
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I have a sister.

325
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I get excited when I see my sister's pajamas.

326
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Do you have a sister?

327
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Did you do something?

328
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Did you do something?

329
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I have a sister.

330
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I have a sister.

331
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Did you do something?

332
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
What are you doing?

333
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Sexual harassment.

334
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I don't do that.

335
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Sexual harassment.

336
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Don't say that.

337
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Did you do it?

338
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I don't do that.

339
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
That's not true.

340
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Really?

341
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Did you do it?

342
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
When you are sleeping...

343
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
What?

344
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,000
When you are sleeping...

345
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I don't care if you are sleeping.

346
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I don't care.

347
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
When you are sleeping...

348
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,000
You have a sister, right?

349
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Just a little.

350
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Really?

351
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I don't have a sister.

352
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I don't know if you are a man or not, but you have a sister.

353
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Did you look at her?

354
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I did.

355
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I see.

356
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
What did you look at?

357
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,000
When you are changing clothes.

358
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Why?

359
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,000
When you are changing clothes, you wear underwear.

360
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
No.

361
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,000
No.

362
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Is it because it's sour?

363
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:11,000
When you are changing your underwear...

364
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
When you are changing your underwear...

365
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
What does that mean?

366
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:20,000
When you are changing your underwear...

367
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,000
That's when you change.

368
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
That's not changing.

369
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
When you are changing your underwear...

370
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
When you are changing your underwear...

371
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,000
When you are changing your underwear...

372
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Have you ever looked at your sister when you are changing your underwear?

373
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
You haven't?

374
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Everyone does that.

375
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I think I looked at my sister when I was changing my underwear.

376
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
You didn't look at her.

377
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
We know that.

378
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
We know that.

379
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
We know that we are being bullied.

380
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
When I look at my sister, I can't help but look at her.

381
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Why?

382
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Why do you look at your sister?

383
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I can't help but look at her.

384
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I can't help but look at her.

385
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I can't help but look at her.

386
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Why do birds move their necks in an unnatural way?

387
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Like this.

388
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Like this.

389
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Like this.

390
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Actually...

391
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Why do you know that?

392
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Birds don't have necks.

393
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
What?

394
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
What do you mean?

395
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
They don't have necks.

396
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
They have necks.

397
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:51,000
They just sit on their bodies.

398
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
They are connected.

399
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
They just sit on their bodies.

400
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:00,000
They don't do anything good.

401
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
They move like this.

402
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Have you ever seen a bird walking like this?

403
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
If it falls, it's bad.

404
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
I know that.

405
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
It will die.

406
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,000
It will die in this group.

407
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
There is a theory.

408
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
A theory?

409
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
There is a theory.

410
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
I see.

411
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I see.

412
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
I don't know.

413
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Who is the person at the emergency exit?

414
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Who is it?

415
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
I don't know until I ask you.

416
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Do you know?

417
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Of course I know.

418
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Is it a woman or a man?

419
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
It's a man.

420
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
There is a model.

421
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
There is a model?

422
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Yes.

423
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
How many people are there?

424
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
I don't know.

425
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Everyone knows.

426
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
What?

427
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Really?

428
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Yes.

429
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Who is it?

430
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Shinichi Chiba.

431
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
The official name of Nihon TV is Nihon TV Broadcasting Company.

432
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Yes.

433
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:08,000
The official name of Yokohama Kinbai is The Crazy Rider Yokohama Kinbai Rolling Special.

434
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Please tell me the official name of downtown.

435
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Everyone says downtown.

436
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
It's different.

437
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
It's not easy to say that.

438
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
That's right.

439
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Actually, there is more.

440
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Yes.

441
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
You don't know.

442
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,000
It's always in me.

443
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,000
When I hear the name of downtown, I think it's different.

444
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
It's always in me.

445
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I think it's great.

446
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Really?

447
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Please tell me.

448
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
What?

449
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
The official name.

450
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:56,000
The official name?

451
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
