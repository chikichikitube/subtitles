1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Before the performance, I can't see that man again

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Good morning

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Okamoto-san told me to come with you

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Please

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
He told me to come to Haneda

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Haneda? It's really far

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Why?

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I want to stay here

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I'm sorry

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
What should we do?

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Let's go home

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Let's go home

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Please change the manager

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Okamoto is angry again

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Manager Okamoto has been angry many times

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
The origin of his anger is always unknown

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Why are you giving me a bungee?

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Bungee?

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
3, 2, 1, go

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
His anger doesn't go down like a bungee

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
The second time he got angry towards a giant guillotine

22
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
It's the third time

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Giant guillotine

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I don't want to do it

25
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Why?

26
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Okamoto gets angrier

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:51,000
The third time he asked for a human cannon banana bird

28
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Human cannon banana bird

29
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Human cannon banana bird

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'll do it

31
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
The strongest adventurer in the entertainment industry

32
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Manager Okamoto

33
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Where will he go?

34
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
This program is provided by the sponsor you are watching

35
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
What is it?

36
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
It's money

37
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
For what?

38
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
It's just a picture

39
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
It's just a picture

40
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
What is it?

41
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Where is it?

42
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Where is it?

43
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Over there

44
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
This is bad

45
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Okamoto, this is the airport

46
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
He's angry

47
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
What's wrong?

48
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
It's not cool

49
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
What's not cool? It's always like this

50
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
What's not cool?

51
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
The cat has changed

52
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
It's true

53
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
It's in the hospital

54
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Your cat is in the hospital

55
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I'm going to Okinawa

56
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
It's sudden but I'm going to Okinawa

57
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Why?

58
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I'll do it like this

59
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Why are you looking at the camera?

60
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Why are you looking at the camera?

61
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Why?

62
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Why?

63
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I'm going

64
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Get ready

65
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Okinawa is the southernmost part of Japan

66
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
The blue sky and the blue sea

67
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
The sun is burning on the white beach

68
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:05,000
What does he want to do in this resort?

69
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Do you know why I came here?

70
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I came to Okinawa

71
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Everyone, come to Okinawa

72
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Okinawa

73
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
It's hot

74
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
It's hot

75
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I'm the only one here

76
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
It's very hot

77
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Everyone should dress up like this

78
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Let's go

79
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Who is it?

80
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Who is it?

81
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
It's you

82
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I'm going to take it

83
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
The cat is scared

84
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
It's not scared

85
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Let's go

86
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Do you hate it that much?

87
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I don't hate it

88
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I'm doing nothing

89
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Let's go

90
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Let's stop

91
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I'm doing nothing

92
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Are you going home?

93
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I'm not going home

94
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Let's go

95
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I can see you

96
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Let's go

97
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
No

98
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I can see you

99
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I can see you

100
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Let's go

101
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
This is it

102
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Let's go

103
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Without any explanation

104
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
The boy is on the bus

105
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Where is he going?

106
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Where are you going?

107
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I know

108
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Don't smoke

109
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Why?

110
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Because the cat hates it

111
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,000
He calls me every time

112
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
He looks surprised

113
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I've been watching him

114
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Where?

115
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
You'll know when you get off

116
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
How many times have you been to Okinawa?

117
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Stop smoking

118
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Are you stupid?

119
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Are you really stupid?

120
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
We're here

121
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
We're here

122
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
What's this?

123
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
It's hot

124
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
It's hot

125
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Okinawa is hot

126
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Come here

127
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
What is this?

128
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I don't know

129
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
It's hot

130
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Do you know what it is?

131
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
It's a grand

132
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I don't know if you're stupid

133
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Why did you change your clothes?

134
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Because it's hot

135
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Because I came to Okinawa

136
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Here

137
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I know

138
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
It's a cattle farm

139
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
A cattle farm?

140
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
What are you doing?

141
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I came to Okinawa to have a cattle farm

142
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
He wants me to have a cattle farm

143
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
He wants me to have a cattle farm

144
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,000
What is this?

145
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
It's hot

146
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
When did you get this?

147
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Look

148
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
It's Okamoto

149
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I'm saving this

150
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Do you want to be like this?

151
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Yes

152
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
It's dangerous

153
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
It's okay

154
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I'm not going to hurt you

155
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I came here to do this

156
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I brought you here

157
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Manager Okamoto challenges Okinawa cattle

158
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Okinawa cattle

159
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
The cattle are afraid of each other

160
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Sometimes the attack of the thick horn is fatal

161
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
It can kill people

162
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,000
The intensity is the best in Japan

163
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
It looks like a cow

164
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I'm motivated

165
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Cow

166
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Cow

167
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Cow

168
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Cow

169
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Cow

170
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Cow

171
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Cow

172
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Cow

173
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Cow

174
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Cow

175
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Cow

176
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Cow

177
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Cow

178
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Cow

179
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Cow

180
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Cow

181
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Cow

182
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Okamoto

183
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Did you see it?

184
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I saw it

185
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I'm going to do that

186
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
What?

187
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Are you going to do it?

188
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I'm going to do it next

189
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Your nails are sharp

190
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
You have long nails

191
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,000
It's huge!

192
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Take a look at it.

193
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
It's huge.

194
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
It's not anything.

195
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Why don't you go closer and take a look?

196
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Just as we planned.

197
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:04,000
This is it.

198
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
It's coming.

199
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
It's looking at us.

200
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
It's looking at us.

201
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
It must be a 751.

202
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
It's dangerous.

203
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
It's scary.

204
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
It's dangerous.

205
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
It's coming.

206
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
It's in front of us.

207
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
It's a meteorite.

208
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
It's over.

209
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
It's a meteorite.

210
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
It's pushing.

211
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
It's going to break.

212
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
It's going to break.

213
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
It's going to break.

214
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
It's going to break.

215
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
How about you hit it from above?

216
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
It's going to break.

217
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
You're different today.

218
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
You're different today.

219
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Come back, Okamoto-san.

220
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Does that mean we won?

221
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
It's amazing, Okamoto-san.

222
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
We fought.

223
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
We won this time.

224
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
You're satisfied, right?

225
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Let's go to the Mayakawa Shimbatsu.

226
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Let's go.

227
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
We still have 30 minutes left.

228
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I'll do the opening.

229
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I'll do it.

230
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Let's do it next time.

231
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I'll do it next time.

232
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I'll do it all the time.

233
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Are you sure?

234
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Okamoto's anger that doesn't know how to stay.

235
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Who will wait for the next one?

236
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I'll drag you around a lot.

237
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I'll drag you around a lot.

238
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I'll drag you around a lot.

239
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I'll drag you around a lot.

240
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I'm going to sleep.

241
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I'm going to sleep.

242
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
What are you doing?

243
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Wake up.

244
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I'm awake.

245
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Okinawa is fun.

246
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Let's have fun.

247
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
You guys don't usually come.

248
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Why are you laughing?

249
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
There's not much to use at this stage.

250
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
There's not much to use at this stage.

251
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
It's about half a year.

252
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
It's about half a year.

253
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I'll have to work hard from now on.

254
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I'll have to work hard from now on.

255
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
It's okay if you do a talk show.

256
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
It's okay if you do a talk show.

257
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Really?

258
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
It's okay if you do a talk show.

259
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
We're playing.

260
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
You look like a new man.

261
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
You look like a new man.

262
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I was big back then.

263
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I was big back then.

264
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Is this the place?

265
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Yes, this is the place.

266
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Okamoto said he'd do it for 30 minutes.

267
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Okamoto said he'd do it for 30 minutes.

268
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
He went to a private beach at a luxury hotel.

269
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
He went to a private beach at a luxury hotel.

270
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
What is he going to do at this beach?

271
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
What is he going to do at this beach?

272
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
What is he going to do at this beach?

273
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Look at this.

274
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
It's getting cloudy.

275
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
It's getting cloudy.

276
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
The weather is not good.

277
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
You've never been to a place like this.

278
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Is this my type?

279
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
That's...

280
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I want to hear it.

281
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I want to hear it.

282
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
He's got a cat on his back.

283
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
He's got a cat on his back.

284
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
He's got a cat on his back.

285
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Hug him.

286
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
It's like a handmade tea.

287
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I'm going to ride that.

288
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I'm going to ride that.

289
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
That?

290
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
You're all happy, right?

291
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
You can't come here.

292
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
You can't come here.

293
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:30,000
This is funny.

294
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
This is funny.

295
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Is this how it's going to be?

296
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
You're going to dive in.

297
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
You're going to dive in.

298
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
You're going to dive in.

299
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
You're going to break the watermelon with this.

300
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,160
Mr. Okamoto, we've come a long way and we wanted to see this

301
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,160
We've come a long way and we wanted to see this because I want to see it.

302
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,000
No, it's because I want to see it.

303
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,040
Manager OKAMOTO.

304
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,040
challenge to breaking watermelon in the water.

305
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,520
It's an ancient art that may have been passed down among the people.

306
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,360
It's an ancient art that may have been passed down among the people.

307
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,000
Okamoto will attempt this fürthe in the water 5m deep.

308
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Okamoto will attempt this fürthe in the water 5m deep.

309
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
How much do I have to pay you?

310
00:14:08,000 --> 00:13:51,700
That's three hundred fifty.

311
00:13:47,700 --> 00:14:11,700
All cash?

312
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,200
It's cash.

313
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,400
It's a card.

314
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:27,400
It's here

315
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:32,400
Okamoto san

316
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:36,400
I'm gonna do this for 30 minutes

317
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:43,400
If this doesn't work we're gonna go to Kanda Pans

318
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,400
It's only been 30 seconds

319
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:50,400
It's been a minute and a half

320
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:53,400
Okamoto san

321
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,400
You can think about it later

322
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,400
Don't say it here

323
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:00,400
I'll cool down

324
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,400
Okamoto san

325
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,400
I'm gonna blow from the water

326
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,400
This is

327
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,400
I'm gonna blow this

328
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,400
Is it okay to jump in?

329
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:13,400
The water got wet

330
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,400
Hey

331
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:20,400
Are you okay?

332
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,400
What's wrong with your face?

333
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:27,400
What's wrong with you?

334
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:30,400
What's wrong?

335
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:34,400
It's hot

336
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:39,400
It's hot

337
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:46,400
What do you mean it's hot?

338
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,400
Okamoto san

339
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,400
Okamoto san

340
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,400
Bye bye

341
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,400
You can't go back

342
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,400
Okamoto san

343
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,400
Hey

344
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:07,400
It's hot

345
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,400
It's scary

346
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:13,400
What are you doing?

347
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,400
Dive from there

348
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:18,400
Here

349
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:22,400
It's cold

350
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:25,400
What are you doing?

351
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:29,400
You're just putting on a face

352
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,400
Dive

353
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:35,400
It's hot

354
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,400
Don't say it's hot

355
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:40,400
Dive

356
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,400
Dive

357
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:47,400
What's wrong?

358
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:50,400
It's not funny

359
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,400
It's not funny

360
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:55,400
I can't say it's really hot

361
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:59,400
Come here and hold the end of the bamboo

362
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,400
We'll go down

363
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,400
I'll push

364
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,400
Let's go

365
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,400
This way

366
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:16,400
This way

367
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,400
Okamoto san

368
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:26,400
It's hot

369
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,400
Okamoto san

370
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,400
Let's go home

371
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:49,400
We'll take you to the middle of the field

372
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,400
Are you going to do something else?

373
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,400
I'll do it again

374
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,400
You can do it

375
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,400
I'll do it again

376
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,400
Take the rest

377
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,400
Are you going to do it again?

378
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,400
I'll do it again

379
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,400
Put your energy in

380
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:22,400
Put your energy in

381
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,400
I don't know

382
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,400
I don't know

383
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:31,400
It's the same

384
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,400
Is this the human arrest we did before?

385
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,400
Yes

386
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,400
That island over there

387
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:41,400
We'll go there together

388
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,400
I'll go first

389
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:47,400
I'll tie the rope myself

390
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,400
Everyone come with me

391
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,400
What is this?

392
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,400
This is anger

393
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,400
I'll stab you

394
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,400
Let's play together

395
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,400
Let's play

396
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,400
How much can we play in this space?

397
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,400
Okamoto san

398
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:07,400
Your ideal image is too big

399
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:10,400
It's really cool

400
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:14,400
Manager Okamoto is going to Okishima to challenge the human arrest

401
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:19,400
Last time in Tokyo, Okamoto failed to catch the human arrest

402
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:24,400
He chose the human arrest in the ocean in Okinawa

403
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,400
The distance is 50 meters

404
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,400
Will Okamoto's body make it to Okishima safely?

405
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,400
Okamoto san

406
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,400
I've set it up as you wanted

407
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,400
Is it okay?

408
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,400
It's okay

409
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,400
I'll stab the island that came out from here

410
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:44,400
Everyone came later

411
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,400
They came with ropes

412
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,400
I'll stab you with this

413
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,400
I'll stab you with this

414
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,400
I got it

415
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:57,400
What?

416
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,400
What is that?

417
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,400
He's angry

418
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,400
It wasn't in the picture

419
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,400
It's sweat

420
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,400
It's sweat

421
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,400
It fell into the water

422
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,400
I want to play over there

423
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,400
Let's play over there

424
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,400
What are you doing?

425
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,400
Let's have a barbeque

426
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,400
Let's have a barbeque

427
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,400
I've never been to Hanoi

428
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,400
Okamoto san, can you hear me?

429
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,400
Okamoto san, can you hear me?

430
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,400
He's saying oh

431
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,400
He's saying oh

432
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,400
I'll close it

433
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,400
He's saying oh

434
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,400
He's saying oh

435
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,400
Oh's pattern

436
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,400
Lift it

437
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:06,400
It needs to be at the right angle

438
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,400
It's at the right angle

439
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,400
Let's go

440
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,400
5 seconds before take off

441
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,400
4, 3, 2, 1

442
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,400
Start

443
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,400
5 seconds before take off

444
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:30,400
4, 3, 2, 1

445
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:50,400
Start

446
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,400
5 seconds before take off

447
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:06,400
4, 3, 2, 1

448
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,400
It's fine

449
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,400
You're wearing a robe

450
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,400
It's fine

451
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,400
Your head is off

452
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,400
Okamoto san, what's wrong?

453
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,400
What?

454
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,400
My head

455
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,400
What's wrong with your head?

456
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,400
Where did it go?

457
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,400
What's wrong with your head?

458
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,400
It's fine

459
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,400
I won't be on TV anymore

460
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,400
What did you hate the most?

461
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,400
Let's look back

462
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,400
Reality

463
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,400
The picture over there

464
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,400
It's a dream

465
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,400
I saw it in my dream

466
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,400
I wanted to be a mother

467
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,400
I wanted to be a mother

468
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,400
5 seconds before take off

469
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,400
4, 3, 2, 1

470
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,400
Where are you going?

471
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,400
I'm sorry

472
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,400
I don't know

473
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,400
What?

474
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,400
I don't know

475
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,400
You should talk

476
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,400
What's wrong with you?

477
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,400
What are you doing?

478
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,400
What are you doing?

479
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,400
I'm having fun

480
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,400
Ouch

481
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,400
I'm tired

482
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,400
I can't do it

483
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,400
I'll get angry

484
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,400
If I do it too much

485
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,400
I'll get angry

486
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,400
5 seconds before take off

487
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,400
4, 3, 2, 1

488
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:56,400
What's wrong with you?
