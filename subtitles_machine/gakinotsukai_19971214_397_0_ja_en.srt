1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,320
In the first episode of Gaki no Tsukai, Tsukitsuki's Impersonation Voice Project,

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:05,080
Don't be found out!

3
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:10,320
Now, Matsumoto-san.

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:10,880
Yes, yes.

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:11,720
The rules are a bit...

6
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:12,920
The rules are difficult.

7
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:17,160
Hamada-san or me, we'll go to the other side of the wall.

8
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:17,600
Outside?

9
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:18,000
Yes.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,960
The rest of you will do your best to impersonate.

11
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:21,480
I see.

12
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,800
If I go to the other side, I'll focus on hitting Hamada.

13
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,320
If you're found out, I'll give you 10,000 yen in fines.

14
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,760
If you're found out, I'll give you 10,000 yen in fines.

15
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,320
I see.

16
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:34,440
That means...

17
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:35,840
The fines won't work.

18
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,920
The fines won't work.

19
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,040
Let's do our best.

20
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,640
Let's do it.

21
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,400
This is a sudden project.

22
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:45,520
What's the sudden project?

23
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,840
I just thought about it.

24
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,000
You can't do it, can you?

25
00:00:50,000 --> 00:01:01,760
That's why it's fun, even if it's sudden.

26
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:07,000
This program is brought to you by these sponsors.

27
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,560
I'll guess first.

28
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,760
I'll tell you the number.

29
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,160
Tell me the number.

30
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,440
What number am I?

31
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,680
Yes.

32
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:15,880
First, we'll decide on the topic.

33
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:16,840
Yes.

34
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:17,520
This?

35
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,200
Ah, let's go with this.

36
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,200
This is easy to understand.

37
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,400
Let's go.

38
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,880
I don't know.

39
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,880
I'll ask carefully and I'll understand.

40
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:33,600
Matsumoto, what's your specialty?

41
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,880
Guess me.

42
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:35,480
Yes.

43
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,080
Yes.

44
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:39,200
I was imitating you just now.

45
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,360
Whose?

46
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:40,960
Isn't that right?

47
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,000
What are you doing?

48
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,720
You'll be found out.

49
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:48,680
That's Matsumoto.

50
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,360
First.

51
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:54,120
What are you doing?

52
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:56,280
Second.

53
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,720
What are you doing?

54
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,320
Third.

55
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,880
What are you doing?

56
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,440
Fourth.

57
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,680
What are you doing?

58
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,520
Fifth.

59
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:14,880
What are you doing?

60
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:17,880
Sixth.

61
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:21,880
What are you doing?

62
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:24,200
Seventh.

63
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:27,040
What are you doing?

64
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,080
Eighth.

65
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:34,040
What are you doing?

66
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,400
What's your number?

67
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:40,880
Seventh.

68
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:43,200
I was confident just now.

69
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,440
I knew it.

70
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:49,640
By the way, which number was similar to Nijiwan?

71
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,440
Endo is good.

72
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,760
Who is number six?

73
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,840
I'm number six.

74
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:02,040
I'm number six.

75
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,240
What are you doing?

76
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:08,040
What are you doing?

77
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,040
I want to be praised.

78
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,680
I'm number six.

79
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:18,240
Thank you very much, you idiot.

80
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:34,440
You didn't have to do it twice.

81
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,960
Number one.

82
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:40,960

Hey, Kitaro.

00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:26,880
This is difficult.

98
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,120

Ah, I get it now.

181
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,480
You get it right away.

182
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,480
You have to do it better.

183
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,480
You're too bad at it.

184
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,480
I can't help it.

185
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,480
I want to get it in that pattern too.

186
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,480
Two, two.

187
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,480
If you do this, you won't get it.

188
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,480
I'm going to win.

189
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:12,480
I'm nervous.

190
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,480
Number one.

191
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:19,480
What the hell is that?

192
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,480
That was funny.

193
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,480
Number two.

194
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:27,480
