1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The first time, the Badminton tournament where the winner gets 1 million yen!

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
There's no one here today, right?

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
That's right.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Your opponent is Endo-san.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Endo-san's temperature was a little higher than the normal one.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
It's a little higher, but I'll take care of it.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I'll do my best today.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
That's what you're supposed to do.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Actually, I was thinking of Hamada-san's power-hara.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
What? Really?

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
My mental state...

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I didn't know that.

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
It may take longer than I thought.

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Endo-kun's vacation.

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
The four of us should play badminton and wait for Ku-chan.

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
That's enough.

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
That's not enough.

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
That's enough.

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
That's enough.

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
You can't eat a million yen.

21
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
In this day and age.

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
That's right.

23
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I understand.

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Rock, paper, scissors?

25
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Rock, paper, scissors.

26
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
And then, with a rock, paper, scissors, you do that.

27
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
That's right.

28
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Hello Japanese comedian people.

29
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Hello to all Japanese comedians.

30
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I am Benjamin Bonas.

31
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I am Benjamin Bonas.

32
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I am very very big money owner

33
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I am the world's richest man

34
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
When we were talking to the four of you here, you were already looking at us

35
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
We were waiting for you

36
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
You should have waited for Kuro-chan first

37
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I don't know that!

38
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
He was eating a lot of characters.

39
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
A man who suddenly appeared, called Benjamin Bonas.

40
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
What is his purpose?

41
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
What's wrong?

42
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
You are Benjamin Bonas too?

43
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I am Benjamin Bonas.

44
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Don't imitate me.

45
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
World famous.

46
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I heard that there are many famous musicians.

47
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
For example?

48
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
For example?

49
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Michael Jackson

50
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Michael Jackson

51
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
That's amazing.

52
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Madonna

53
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Madonna

54
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Eihara Masahiro

55
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Eihara Masahiro

56
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Why are you suddenly saying that?

57
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
That's a lot of names.

58
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Now?

59
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Now

60
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Audition

61
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Now, I will hold an audition to decide the next Hollywood star.

62
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Audition?

63
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Yes, me is America.

64
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I will take you to America.

65
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I know.

66
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Iwagawa said it, but it seems to be going up a lot.

67
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
It's going up a lot.

68
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I smoked on the smokehouse, but I'm as strong as a log.

69
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I'm as strong as a log engine.

70
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
It's going up a lot.

71
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Are you okay?

72
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Adachi of the book.

73
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Adachi of the book.

74
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Cal

75
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Cal

76
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
What's your name?

77
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
What's your name?

78
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
What's your name?

79
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
What's your name?

80
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Cal

81
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Cal

82
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I love you Benjamin Bonas

83
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Oh

84
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Thank you

85
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Social distance now

86
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
What is this?

87
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
What is this?

88
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
If you do it, you'll be in trouble.

89
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Social distance is a good way to keep your distance.

90
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
That's a great way.

91
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
You guys, do you know anything about Hollywood?

92
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Of course we do.

93
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
There's a Hollywood version of the Gakitsuka.

94
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I know that.

95
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I'll teach you.

96
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
This is the Gakitsuka member, right?

97
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Yes.

98
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Gakitsuka member, okay?

99
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Yes.

100
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
For example, this.

101
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Yes, that's me.

102
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
If it's Hollywood, this person is doing it.

103
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
It's Sam Schultz.

104
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Hollywood Sam Schultz.

105
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
It's a white peach fruit.

106
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
And this is the end of today's break.

107
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
The end.

108
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I'm telling you, I'm telling you.

109
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
It's a famous saying.

110
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Who?

111
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Rampage Jackson is doing it.

112
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Oh, that kind of person.

113
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I'm doing it with a chain.

114
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I don't know who it is.

115
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
It's Kevin.

116
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
It's a little similar.

117
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
It's a little similar.

118
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
The flow is completely different.

119
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Oh, this is the problem.

120
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
You're the only one who's not happy.

121
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I'm going to take you to Hollywood, but you don't know anything about Hollywood, do you?

122
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
No, I don't know anything about it.

123
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Okay, so I'm going to test you on Hollywood.

124
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
What about Hollywood?

125
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Hurry up and tell me.

126
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
You're the important one.

127
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
You're the important one?

128
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I don't need to be told.

129
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Wait a minute.

130
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,500
Do you know anything about Hollywood?

131
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,000
No.

132
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
What do you mean?

133
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I've been there.

134
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
You've been there?

135
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Yes.

136
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
When did you go?

137
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Wait a minute. When did you go?

138
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
About 20 years ago.

139
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
You went about 20 years ago?

140
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Yes.

141
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
How many days did you go?

142
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I went for about a week.

143
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
You're quite a long-term goer. You know a lot about Hollywood.

144
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Well, I went to play and stuff.

145
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Where did you play with Hollywood?

146
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
What are you talking about? Stop it!

147
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
What are you doing?

148
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I deleted it because you started talking

149
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Oh, sorry

150
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I didn't want you to talk

151
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
It's rude, right?

152
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
No, it's fine

153
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I'll do it

154
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Who else played with Hollywood?

155
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I've been there

156
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
How was the American era?

157
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
The American era?

158
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
No, it's fine

159
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
How was the American era?

160
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I'm fine with just closing my eyes.

161
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Don't worry about me.

162
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I'm fine with just doing it while I'm on the phone.

163
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Oh, you went to New York?

164
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
New York is great.

165
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
It's my job though.

166
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I like New York a lot.

167
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I'm not laughing because I'm not that far from Hollywood and New York.

168
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
If I went to Japan, I could go to other cities.

169
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
But in America, I'd have to use a plane.

170
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I'm not kidding.

171
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I'd have to use a plane to get there.

172
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
It's fine.

173
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
It's fine.

174
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Please tell us more about it.

175
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
There's something about it, right?

176
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Sorry, sorry.

177
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I don't think you know anything about Hollywood.

178
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
So, get into me.

179
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Tell me about my cool points one by one.

180
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Adachi and Carlton will give you a demonstration.

181
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Everyone, please watch.

182
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Let's go.

183
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Hey, Ryo-san!

184
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Can you sing a cool song for the bonus?

185
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
1, 2, 3, 4!

186
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
First, Adachi-kun, go for it!

187
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
You're very rich

188
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Next is Karukin-chan, go for it!

189
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
You're tall

190
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Yeah!

191
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
OK, OK

192
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Now I'll have you guys die together

193
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I can't do that!

194
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I really don't want to do it

195
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I'll do it in order

196
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
So you can say my cool part

197
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
And at the end, there's a key

198
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
This is a game called Kill or Kiss

199
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
If you get a kiss, you're okay

200
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
If you get a kill, you're out

201
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Please

202
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Okay, let's go

203
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:45,500
Let's go!

204
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:00,900
It's long

205
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:01,900
Hey you guys!

206
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:05,600
Please say something cool about me, Benjamin Bonus!

207
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,000
First, Hosei-chan

208
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,800
Please say something!

209
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,800
The watch is very cool

210
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:19,800
Next is the horse, please say it

211
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,800
The white hair suits you

212
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,800
Next is the hippo, please say it

213
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,800
The cut-out is cool

214
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,800
Next is the raccoon, please say it

215
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:36,800
The sunglasses are very gorgeous

216
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:40,800
You're a real shiba inu.

217
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:41,800
Seriously.

218
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,800
Hey, you're a real shiba inu.

219
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:51,060
Hey, bring me some

220
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:53,800
No, no. I got a cold.

221
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,800
I'm begging you, Tanaka.

222
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,800
You're the only one who's slipping right now.

223
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,800
Seriously.

224
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,800
How many percent of myself did I get?

225
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,800
In my mind...

226
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,800
Hey!

227
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,800
Calm down, I'm calm

228
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,800
I can't stop the others

229
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,800
I'll show you a demonstration

230
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,800
Hey Hosei-chan, let's do all of it

231
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,800
Yes

232
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,800
Say all of my lines

233
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,800
1, 2, 3, 4

234
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,800
Look at Hosei-chan

235
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:30,800
Look at me

236
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,800
Arland Chirp Chirp Arman

237
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,800
That's the best

238
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,800
The needlework is close

239
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,800
The belt is cool

240
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,800
One more time, Hose-chan, say it

241
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,800
If the stick is easy to use

242
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:05,800
One more time, Hose-chan, give it to me

243
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:08,800
The jacket suits you

244
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,800
Houdara Tanaka-kun, say it

245
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:15,800
The socks are very charming

246
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,800
What are you doing?

247
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,800
What are you doing?

248
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,800
You're really a shiba inu.

249
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,800
Someone bring me some角材.

250
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,800
You're really a shiba inu.

251
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,800
Someone bring me some角材.

252
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:30,800
Kill.

253
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,800
No, it's not a kill.

254
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,800
Hosei-chan did so many things.

255
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,800
Let's do it again. Can you do it again?

256
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,800
Let's do it again. Can you do it again?

257
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,800
Yes, I can.

258
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:42,800
Can you do it?

259
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,800
No, I can't.

260
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,800
I can't do it alone.

261
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,800
I think everyone should do it.

262
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,500
I can't do that. I'll leave it to you.

263
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,500
If you want to quit, I'll quit.

264
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,300
Can I quit?

265
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:56,600
You can quit.

266
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,000
Then I'll quit.

267
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,400
You're quitting?

268
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,000
Yes.

269
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,400
Then, Hosei-chan, get out!

270
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,600
Please leave.

271
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,500
You've done your job for today.

272
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,900
I'll quit.

273
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:13,800
Sorry, I...

274
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,000
You can do it again.

275
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
That's right. Sorry.

276
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,200
I didn't think you'd ask me to leave.

277
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,200
There's no way I have a chance.

278
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,200
Please leave.

279
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,200
Really?

280
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,200
Thank you.

281
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,200
No, no, no.

282
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,200
How was it?

283
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:29,200
Can you give me a chance at the end?

284
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,200
Do you want to do it all?

285
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,200
I'll do it all.

286
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,200
And then, if you get a kiss, I'll accept it.

287
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,200
I see.

288
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,200
Okay.

289
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,200
I'll give you four kisses.

290
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,200
Four kisses for one person?

291
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,200
Yes, yes.

292
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,200
Okay, I understand.

293
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,200
No way. I'm doing something impossible right now.

294
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,200
Yes, I'll give you the last chance.

295
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,200
Can you do the opposite?

296
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,200
I got it

297
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,200
Let's get on the stage

298
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,200
Let's start with the feeling

299
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,200
Let's go

300
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,200
Let's do it with the feeling

301
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,200
Hose-chan

302
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:09,200
You'll get a good result

303
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,560
I'm sure you'll get something

304
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:16,060
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14

305
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:19,440
First, Hose-chan, give me a shot

306
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,240
There are two rings

307
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:26,240
Next, Hose-chan, give me a shot

308
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,760
The glass in the sunglasses is piling up

309
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:33,040
Next, Hose-chan, give me a shot

310
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,200
Your white hair is shining

311
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:39,520
Never were you given us Californians ka!.

312
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:43,960
Stuck to your wszyscy herr hair.

313
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:49,360

314
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:47,260
It had its whereabouts.

315
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,820
Why, well

316
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:52,360
You got any answers to this here?!

317
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:56,380
Yeah loud af.

318
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:57,440
Hey, I guess

319
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:03,420
WE'LL should try

320
00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:02,260
Diet

321
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:04,720
Durin

322
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,720
Excuse me.

323
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,720
What the hell is this?

324
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,720
Shouji-san, you can go.

325
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,720
What the hell is this?

326
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,720
Are you sure?

327
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,720
Do your best.

328
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,720
Hosei.

329
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,720
Yes.

330
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,720
Come here.

331
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:18,720
Yes.

332
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,720
Are you sure you are okay with that?

333
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,720
Are you sure you are okay with leaving the room?

334
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,720
No!

335
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,720
I told you so!

336
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,720
I told you so!

337
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,720
I told you so!

338
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,720
You will get angry.

339
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,720
Excuse me!

340
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:37,720
Come on! Come on!

341
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,720
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

342
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,720
Get out!

343
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,720
Please forgive him.

344
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,720
That's enough.

345
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,720
Are you regretting?

346
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,720
Yes, please forgive me.

347
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,720
Then, I can't go back.

348
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:58,720
Next, to go to Hollywood, speed and reflexes are important.

349
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,720
I'll give you a test now.

350
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,720
Everyone, please put this on your right hand.

351
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:12,720
Put your right hand on your right hand and try the Haryutou Star's secret skill, the reflex test.

352
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,720
From now on, we will play a reflex game.

353
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:18,720
The title is, Guntei Up Down!

354
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,720
Please raise and lower your right hand with the capacity of a hataage game.

355
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:26,720
I'll raise and lower my hand in an English way.

356
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,720
I think it's difficult because it's English.

357
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,720
Oh my god!

358
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,720
Oh my god!

359
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,720
What?

360
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,720
In the end, it's better to translate it.

361
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,720
Your fast is the key.

362
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:08,720
The speed is...

363
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,720
Max speed.

364
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:10,720
It's max speed.

365
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,720
Let's go with space speed.

366
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,720
Ultimate space speed.

367
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,720
Okay.

368
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,720
Can you do it?

369
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,720
Raise your arms.

370
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,720
No.

371
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,720
Lower your arms.

372
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,720
No, no.

373
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,720
Don't raise your arms. Lower your arms.

374
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,720
Oh my god!

375
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:32,720
And the pattern is the same all the time!

376
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,720
All of them are the same!

377
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,720
What?!

378
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:40,720
Help!

379
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,720
Help!

380
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,720
The next game, Hollywood Star is...

381
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,720
What is Hollywood Star?

382
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,720
Crocodile Dandy

383
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,720
It's Crocodile Dandy

384
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,720
Open

385
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,720
I'll give you a chance to fight.

386
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,720
I'll start with Kanji.

387
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,720
Put this on.

388
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:03,720
The items for Crocodile Dandy are knife and cowboy hat.

389
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:07,720
First, Tanaka, who is familiar with animals.

390
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,720
Yes, yes.

391
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:13,720
Three, two, one.

392
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,720
I'll give you a chance to fight.

393
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,720
I'll give you a chance to fight.

394
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,720
Tanaka san

395
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,720
Yes

396
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,720
3, 2, 1, Fight!

397
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,720
I think he's done

398
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,720
He's been bitten

399
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:36,720
Good, good, good

400
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,720
Yes, yes, yes, yes

401
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,720
Yes, yes, yes

402
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,720
You did it

403
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:42,720
Raise your hand if you've defeated him

404
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,720
Yes!

405
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,720
Nice fight

406
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:46,720
Okay, good.

407
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,720
Thank you.

408
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,720
Okay, then, Machan, can you do it?

409
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:50,720
Yes.

410
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,720
Let's go, 3, 2, 1, fight!

411
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,720
Help me!

412
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,720
I'm dying!

413
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,720
I'm dying!

414
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,720
Don't make a comedy.

415
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,720
No, you have to do it properly.

416
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:10,720
I didn't laugh much.

417
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,720
You didn't come to make a joke like that.

418
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,720
I'm sorry.

419
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,720
Oh, I see. I'm sorry.

420
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,720
The staff told me that I came here to die.

421
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:22,720
I was told that I came here to die.

422
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,720
I'll do my best.

423
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,720
Hosei, can you do it?

424
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,720
You're the one who's going to die.

425
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,720
I'll give you a little more difficult challenge.

426
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,720
Cut this crocodile.

427
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,720
Let's go to the real crocodile.

428
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,720
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

429
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,720
I really came here to die.

430
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,720
Open your eyes!

431
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,720
Eye spray!

432
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,720
The dog is changing...

433
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,720
The dog is changing...

434
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,720
He really is going to die...

435
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,720
Open your eyes!

436
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,720
Open your eyes!

437
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,720
I'm counting on you!

438
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,720
Now, Hosei.

439
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,720
Very strong.

440
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:30,720
I will kill you.

441
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,720
I have never seen you like this.

442
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,720
That was good.

443
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,720
Then, Hamada, you try.

444
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,720
I'm scared. I'm going to do it.

445
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,720
Then, Mr. Hamada, fight!

446
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,720
You defeated him.

447
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,720
No, no, no.

448
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,720
You completely defeated him.

449
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,720
You completely defeated him.

450
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,720
Did he eat it?

451
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,720
What's wrong?

452
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,720
I was hit like this and I slipped like this.

453
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,720
But when I came back, I went back a little.

454
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:08,720
You went too far.

455
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,720
I went too far.

456
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,720
With this, all the tests are over.

457
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:17,720
Who passed the audition?

458
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:21,720
Finally, I will officially announce who passed.

459
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,720
Hama-chan.

460
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,720
It was amazing.

461
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,720
I'm sorry.

462
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,720
What?

463
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:28,720
I'm sorry.

464
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:33,220
Yun-bo was like this, and I was like this.

465
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:35,220
It was a huge shock.

466
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:37,220
I'm sorry.

467
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:39,220
Pass.

468
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:40,720
It was amazing.

469
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,720
Hama-chan, congratulations on passing!

470
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,720
Congratulations.

471
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,220
It's a pass, but...

472
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,720
Hama-chan, congratulations.

473
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,220
But, I'm really laughing, but...

474
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:55,720
The screen is too Asian.

475
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:58,720
So, let's change our faces.

476
00:19:58,720 --> 00:19:59,720
What?

477
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,720
We can't catch up with that face.

478
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,720
Can't catch up?

479
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:06,720
It's impossible, honestly.

480
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,720
Tama-chan, let's go fix your face.

481
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,720
What?

482
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,720
Takasu is waiting for you.

483
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,720
What are you talking about?

484
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,720
Let's go.

485
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,720
Yes.

486
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,720
You're really going to take me?

487
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:22,720
Well, I'm a little scared of being taken by Kuu-chan.

488
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,720
Come, cutie

489
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,720
Wow, you're doing well. You're not tired, right?

490
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:33,720
I think Benjamin will be back soon

491
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:34,720
Sorry to keep you waiting

492
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:35,720
He's here

493
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,720
Come

494
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,720
Come, cutie

495
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:46,720
You're doing well. You're not tired, right?

496
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:47,720
Come, cutie

497
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,720
It's good that you're beautiful

498
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,720
I'll give you a needle

499
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,720
What?

500
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,720
Anyone is fine.

501
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:55,720
What?

502
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:56,720
Anyone is fine.

503
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:57,720
I don't think anyone is fine.

504
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:58,720
It's not about the face.

505
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,720
No.

506
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,720
Didn't you say you don't need a face?

507
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,720
No, I don't need it.

508
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,720
I don't have a face.

509
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:08,720
So, I think anyone is fine.

510
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,720
No, it's because you have a spirit.

511
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:11,720
Mr. Benjamin.

512
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:12,720
What?

513
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,720
I'm sorry to interrupt you.

514
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:14,720
What's wrong?

515
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,720
There is a phone call from the American Space Agency.

516
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:21,220
A giant meteorite will soon crash into Japan!

517
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:22,220
What?

518
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:23,220
What?

519
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:24,220
You're kidding, right?

520
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:27,220
We're the only ones who can do that, right?

521
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:28,220
Yes!

522
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:29,220
Let's go!

523
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:39,020
...

524
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,860
...

525
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:42,860
I don't wanna close my eyes

526
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:45,860
I don't wanna force me

527
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:47,860
Cause I miss you, baby

528
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:50,860
And I don't wanna miss a thing

529
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:54,860
Cause even when I dream of you

530
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:57,860
You see the light

531
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:59,860
You don't miss me

532
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:03,860
And I don't wanna miss a thing

533
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:06,860
Don't wanna close my eyes

534
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:11,860
I don't wanna fall asleep, cause I miss you baby

535
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:16,860
Don't wanna sleep

536
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:19,860
I'm sorry, Hamada-san

537
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:23,860
When the curtain was closed, Kuu-chan said,

538
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:25,860
I'm sorry, Hamada-san

539
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:26,860
Did he say that?

540
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:27,860
He did

541
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:28,860
Oh, really?

542
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:31,860
I wish the curtain was closed a little more and I could have waited a little more

543
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:34,860
I'm sorry, Hamada-san, it was pretty early

544
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:39,860
But, the meteorite fell and...

545
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:42,860
And the only one who saved them was...

546
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:43,860
Those four people.

547
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:45,860
I was watching something like that.

548
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:47,860
I wonder what it was.

549
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:52,860
Jackson 5?

550
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:53,860
That's right.

551
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:54,860
Jackson 5.

552
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:56,860
The end

553
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:02,860
It's Snoopy

554
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:14,860
What? What? What?

555
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:15,860
What? Really?

556
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:16,860
It's over

557
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:17,860
It's over?

558
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:20,860
You're kidding me, right?

559
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:21,860
What was that?

560
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:23,860
Is that all?

561
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:27,860
Earth was saved?

562
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:28,860
Saved?
