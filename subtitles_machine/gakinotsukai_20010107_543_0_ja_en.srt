1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Happy New Year!

2
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Happy New Year!

3
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Gaki no Tsukai, ah, 2000, Gaki no Tsukai, Omochiro VTR Best Ten.

4
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Today, I have been chosen to be the host for three consecutive years.

5
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
My name is Yoshimoto Kogyo Fujiwara Hiroshi.

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I look forward to working with you.

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
This year too, I'm sorry, the 21st century too.

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
What are you saying?

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I'm sorry, I don't understand what you're saying.

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The 21st century has started.

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
It's my job, but last year, I'm sorry, I got married.

12
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Why are you sorry?

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I got married last year.

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Congratulations.

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Yes, thank you.

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I think I have to do my best.

17
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Why are there five people?

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
That person is...

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Why are you acting like a new character?

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
The more cards you get, the more gay you are.

21
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The 21st century has started.

22
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
This program is brought to you by the sponsors you see.

23
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I was chosen on my own and by prejudice.

24
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Gaki no Tsukai, Omochiro VTR.

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Why is it that every year you are chosen on your own and by prejudice?

26
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
For some reason, yes, I'm chosen on my own and by prejudice.

27
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
By prejudice?

28
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:06,000
First of all, I would like to announce from 10th to 7th place.

29
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
VTR, check it out.

30
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:16,000
It's funny.

31
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
In the past, Itao has appeared on the set of the show.

32
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
This time, Itao wants Gaki no Tsukai to be his wife.

33
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Yamazaki, Kokoriko and Itao's wives.

34
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Which of them is more suitable to be a wife?

35
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Itao's wife's high tension, please.

36
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Can you do Samba rhythm?

37
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I want to go to Goose and Dandy.

38
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
What is this?

39
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
And the match between Tanaka and Yuusaku Matsuda.

40
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
What is this?

41
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
You said it there.

42
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
You didn't say it there.

43
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Bring it on.

44
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:09,000
But after this, Itao said something beyond our imagination.

45
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
What is this?

46
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
It's you.

47
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Hey.

48
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Hey.

49
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Wait a minute.

50
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Isn't this a true story?

51
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
What?

52
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Hey, are you okay?

53
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
There's no way this is real.

54
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
But this is what it actually looks like.

55
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Are you going to die?

56
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I'm in a coma.

57
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Is it your husband?

58
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,000
My husband is Yamada.

59
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Until what place?

60
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Until 7th place.

61
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
It's just a prank on Yamada.

62
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
It's not a prank.

63
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
It's real.

64
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
It's real.

65
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
It's a real story.

66
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
It's real.

67
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
It's a big success.

68
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
It's a big success.

69
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
It's real.

70
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
It's a documentary.

71
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
It's weird.

72
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
But at that time, there's a scary thing about Hamada.

73
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Last year, Tanaka was washed away.

74
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
It's that time.

75
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
It's that time.

76
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
It's that time.

77
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:31,000
It's been 2 months since he was washed away.

78
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
And...

79
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
And Yuta.

80
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
And Yuta.

81
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
This is Yamada.

82
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Good morning.

83
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
This is Yamada.

84
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
It's the same tone as the anime.

85
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
What is that?

86
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Wait a minute.

87
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
What do you mean you were washed away?

88
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Is this 4th place?

89
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I chose it.

90
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
There's more.

91
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
There's no place to laugh.

92
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Did anyone laugh during the video?

93
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
You laughed.

94
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
You laughed.

95
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
This is Yamada.

96
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Thank you.

97
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Thank you for saving me.

98
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Is this 2nd place?

99
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I'm not sure.

100
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
So is Ogiri.

101
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
This 3rd and 2nd place have a bad image.

102
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Even if you become a user and use 1 million yen to buy fireworks, you'll still be called a joke.

103
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
At that time, I wanted to cut it even more.

104
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
But my ribs were broken.

105
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
It's not broken.

106
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
It's not in the video, but...

107
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
What is it?

108
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
It's a skateboard.

109
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
It's a skateboard in the air.

110
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
That's right.

111
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
On December 10th, I broke my ribs.

112
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
It's not broken.

113
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
It's really broken.

114
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I'll show you.

115
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
The moment it broke...

116
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
The moment it broke, you just fell from here.

117
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
It's dangerous.

118
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Next year, I'll do that video 12 times.

119
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
12 times?

120
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
What does that mean, Fujiwara-kun?

121
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
It's 1st place.

122
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
1st place?

123
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
It's probably that.

124
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
It's probably that.

125
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
It's probably that.

126
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
It's probably that.

127
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I see.

128
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I understand.

129
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
This is 1st place.

130
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
This isn't a punishment.

131
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Every year on New Year's Eve...

132
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
No, no, no.

133
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I'm in trouble.

134
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I'm in trouble.

135
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I'm in trouble.

136
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I'm really in trouble.

137
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I'm really in trouble.

138
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I'm really in trouble.

139
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
If you look at it, it's not that big a deal.

140
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
No, no, no.

141
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I think I'll do this in a movie.

142
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
In a movie.

143
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
A kid's movie.

144
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
But if you look at it up to 10th place...

145
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
There's no Heipo project at all.

146
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
That's true.

147
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
The other day, with Jaguar...

148
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
It's been a while since I've heard number 15.

149
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Oh, that's right.

150
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
It's been a while since I've heard number 15.

151
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Then, I hope for the further development of the 21st century's kid's use.

152
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I'd like to ask the old lady to dance.

153
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I see.

154
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
It's been a while.

155
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I'd like to ask the old lady to dance.

156
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:24,000
It's been a while since I've heard number 15.

157
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I'd like to ask the old lady to dance.

158
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I don't want to cut anything.

159
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
You did it right away.

160
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
This is going to be the end.

161
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
This is going to be the end.

162
00:07:45,000 --> 00:08:08,000
This program was brought to you by these sponsors.
