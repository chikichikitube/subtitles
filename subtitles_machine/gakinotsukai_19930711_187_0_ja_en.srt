1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
You! You do Gyros, G cabur, hee hee!

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
What did you do?

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,240
Well, our time is ап seasoning a second pair-

4
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:17,240
You know me?

5
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:18,240
My waist hurts.

6
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,240
A lot.

7
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:20,240
Okay.

8
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:23,240
You did win,

9
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:26,240
but your usual printing didn't work.

10
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,240
It's because were overconfidently confident.

11
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,740
Earlier, everyone was trying to jump with 130cm, right?

12
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:32,740
You can't jump with such a thing.

13
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:33,740
Oh, really?

14
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:34,740
Yes.

15
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:35,740
Well, I'll try it.

16
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:38,740
I'll jump with 230cm if I can do it twice.

17
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:39,740
I'll jump over here and jump right away.

18
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:40,740
Like this.

19
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:42,740
I'll do it like this.

20
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:45,740
Like this.

21
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:47,740
Well, the rule is simple.

22
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:50,740
You have three chances.

23
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:51,740
Is three chances okay?

24
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:52,740
Yes, it's okay.

25
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:54,740
How many centimeters should I start with?

26
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:57,740
At first, about 120cm.

27
00:00:57,740 --> 00:00:59,740
120cm?

28
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:01,740
I can't believe it.

29
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:05,740
I can't lose twice with a belly roll.

30
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:06,740
It's dangerous.

31
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:07,740
I can't lose twice.

32
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:08,740
I can't wait until I fall over here.

33
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:10,740
You should jump over yourself.

34
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:14,740
This is a punishment game if you lose.

35
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:15,740
That's right.

36
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:19,740
Well, I won't say it here this time.

37
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:21,740
Well, we're both hiding it.

38
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:22,740
That's right.

39
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:23,740
I'll announce it at the end.

40
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:24,740
Okay.

41
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:25,740
That's what it is.

42
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:28,740
Let's get started.

43
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:30,740
Matsumoto vs. Hamada.

44
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:31,740
The 10th match.

45
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:32,740
Run and jump.

46
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:40,740
How will the game go?

47
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:41,740
First of all, Hamada.

48
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:42,740
The first jump.

49
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:43,740
120cm.

50
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:44,740
In the midst of tension.

51
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:46,740
This is easy and clear.

52
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:50,740
I can still afford it.

53
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:52,740
Next, Hitasu Matsumoto.

54
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:54,740
I don't like the atmosphere.

55
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,740
Hamada clears in front of me.

56
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:57,740
I feel the pressure.

57
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:58,740
120cm.

58
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:00,740
A great belly roll.

59
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:05,740
This is also easy and clear.

60
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:08,740
There's a lot of wild animals over there.

61
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:09,740
130cm.

62
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:12,740
130cm.

63
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:16,740
I wonder if I can jump like this.

64
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:17,740
Hamada.

65
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:19,740
130cm.

66
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:20,740
Oops.

67
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:21,740
It was cut.

68
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:24,740
So far, the game is full of tension.

69
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:27,740
I feel the pressure that I can't lose.

70
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:29,740
Let's measure the timing again.

71
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:33,740
It fell like this.

72
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:35,740
130cm jump.

73
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:39,740
Hamada hits the butt.

74
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:40,740
It's a little cold.

75
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:43,740
No.

76
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:44,740
Matsumoto.

77
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:47,740
I want to clear this in one go.

78
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:54,740
It's a great clear.

79
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:55,740
Matsumoto with a belly roll.

80
00:02:55,740 --> 00:03:03,740
I can still afford it.

81
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:05,740
In the midst of tension.

82
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:09,740
This is the second try.

83
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:16,740
Will Kando's throw be decided?

84
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:22,740
It's barely clear.

85
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:25,740
The bar will be raised to 135cm.

86
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:26,740
How was that?

87
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:30,740
Was it easy?

88
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:32,740
Was it good?

89
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:38,740
It hurts.

90
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:41,740
Will he be able to show a jump that exceeds his potential?

91
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:42,740
135cm.

92
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:44,740
Hamada's first try.

93
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:47,740
The timing is not right.

94
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:49,740
Matsumoto is a tough guy.

95
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:55,740
He is nervous.

96
00:03:55,740 --> 00:04:00,740
The second try.

97
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:01,740
It fell.

98
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:06,740
Is this the limit?

99
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:09,740
It's a heavy movement.

100
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:11,740
It hurts.

101
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:14,740
It's the limit.

102
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:16,740
It's quite high.

103
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:18,740
Matsumoto is ahead of the game.

104
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:19,740
135cm.

105
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:22,740
It's the first try.

106
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:27,740
It's a great clear.

107
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:29,740
Matsumoto was once called a high-flying kid.

108
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:40,740
He still has a long way to go.

109
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:41,740
135cm.

110
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:49,740
This is Hamada's second try.

111
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:51,740
Hamada is in the center.

112
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:56,740
What will he do?

113
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:57,740
This is all he can do.

114
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:17,740
It's a great clear.

115
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:20,740
The bar goes up to 140cm.

116
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:26,740
Will he be able to beat Matsumoto?

117
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:32,740
It's a fail.

118
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:34,740
Matsumoto is losing his composure.

119
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:38,740
He wants to clear this in one try.

120
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:41,740
Nice jump.

121
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:45,740
Have you seen Matsumoto's serious expression?

122
00:05:45,740 --> 00:06:04,740
It's a great jump.

123
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,740
This is Hamada's second try.

124
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:08,740
Will he be able to catch the timing of the new jump?

125
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:12,740
It's a fail.

126
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:16,740
It's a close call.

127
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:18,740
This time, it's the same as before.

128
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:24,740
It's a great clear.

129
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:26,740
Matsumoto prays not to fly.

130
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:29,740
It looks like he has nothing left to do.

131
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:32,740
This is Hamada's last try.

132
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:35,740
It's a great clear.

133
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:37,740
It's a jump of fate.

134
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:43,740
It's a close call.

135
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:45,740
It's a fail.

136
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:49,740
It's a close call.

137
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:54,740
It's a great clear.

138
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:58,740
It was a close call.

139
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:00,740
He was flying.

140
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:02,740
I don't know.

141
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:05,740
I lost.

142
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:09,740
Matsumoto's way of flying is great.

143
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:13,740
His eyes are white.

144
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:16,740
The third try was his head.

145
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:18,740
I had to put my head in.

146
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:21,740
I hit the head with a bang.

147
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:22,740
That's all.

148
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:24,740
It was a competition of running and jumping.

149
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:35,740
Matsumoto's way of flying is great.

150
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:40,740
Why did you slow down?

151
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:44,740
I wanted you to do this.

152
00:07:44,740 --> 00:08:03,740
Matsumoto's way of flying is great.

153
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:05,740
That's all.

154
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:07,740
I lost.

155
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:09,740
What was that?

156
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:13,740
Did you want to see the stick?

157
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:17,740
Why did you slow down?

158
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:21,740
I was looking at the stick until the end.

159
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:23,740
Did you want to see it?

160
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:28,740
Are you looking at the stick?

161
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:30,740
I lost.

162
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:32,740
You won't say it here, will you?

163
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:35,740
I won't say it here.

164
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:38,740
It's in the back of this picture.

165
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:39,740
I see.

166
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:42,740
You can watch this video.

167
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:46,740
Did you see it today?

168
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:47,740
What?

169
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:50,740
The wide shot.

170
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:55,740
Shinkase Taishu.

171
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:56,740
Did you see the photo?

172
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:57,740
Shinkase Taishu.

173
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:58,740
Shinkase Taishu.

174
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:00,740
It says Shinkase Taishu.

175
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,740
If you look at the picture now,

176
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:08,740
it looks like a genius.

177
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:12,740
Shinkase Taishu has two lines on the side.

178
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:16,740
There are two cameras.

179
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:17,740
What's going to happen?

180
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:21,740
I don't know.

181
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:24,740
It's that.

182
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:27,740
Everyone is here, right?

183
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:28,740
Speak clearly.

184
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:30,740
What the hell is that?

185
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:33,740
Everyone is here, right?

186
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:36,740
Speak after I tell you.

187
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:38,740
What the hell is that?

188
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:41,740
Speak after I tell you.

189
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:44,740
This kid.

190
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:47,740
This kid and that kid.

191
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:49,740
Who are they?

192
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:51,740
Who is the other one?

193
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:52,740
Everyone is here, right?

194
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:53,740
What?

195
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:54,740
There are a lot of customers.

196
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:58,740
We can't give them any money.

197
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,740
Everyone is here, right?

198
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:03,740
Everyone's laughter is unified.

199
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:06,740
Everyone's laughter is unified.

200
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:07,740
That's right.

201
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:10,740
I don't think that's the case.

202
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:11,740
That's right.

203
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:16,740
That's why everyone's laughter is different.

204
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:20,740
Sometimes I can't stand it because it's so funny.

205
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:21,740
That's right.

206
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:24,740
I was on a plane the other day.

207
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:26,740
I was sitting by the window.

208
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:31,740
When I got off the plane,

209
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:35,740
I landed on the ground.

210
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:37,740
I've never seen anyone like this.

211
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:39,740
When I landed on the ground,

212
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:41,740
I had to stop.

213
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:43,740
I had to stop.

214
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:48,740
I had to stop.

215
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:51,740
What the hell is this?

216
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:53,740
It's funny.

217
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:56,740
No one thinks it's funny.

218
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:58,740
I'm the only one who thinks it's funny.

219
00:10:58,740 --> 00:10:59,740
That's right.

220
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:02,740
Why?

221
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:03,740
I can't imagine it.

222
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:04,740
I'm flying.

223
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:05,740
I'm flying.

224
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:06,740
I'm flying.

225
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:09,740
I'm flying.

226
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:10,740
I'm flying.

227
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:11,740
I'm flying.

228
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:12,740
I can't stop.

229
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:13,740
I can't stop.

230
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:14,740
I'm flying.

231
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:15,740
It's funny.

232
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:21,740
That's funny.

233
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:24,740
That's right.

234
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:30,740
Everyone thinks it's funny.

235
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:34,740
Let's go home.

236
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:37,740
That's cool.

237
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:42,740
There's nothing to talk about.

238
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:44,740
Why?

239
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:47,740
Why don't you come out here and talk?

240
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:48,740
It's my job.

241
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:49,740
Today,

242
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:51,740
I'm going to talk about something interesting

243
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:59,740
one by one, one by one.

244
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:02,740
Are you a newbie?

245
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:06,740
It would be nice if we could stand here and talk.

246
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:08,740
It's true.

247
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:12,740
I'm tired of talking.

248
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:21,740
I heard on the news that Japanese words are getting messed up.

249
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:29,740
Young people are saying that words are getting dirtier and dirtier.

250
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:30,740
I see.

251
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:32,740
I'm pissed off.

252
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:34,740
I don't care.

253
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:35,740
It's getting dirtier and dirtier.

254
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:38,740
I don't care.

255
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:40,740
I'm particular about it.

256
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:42,740
For example,

257
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:45,740
there's a saying that there are only two times.

258
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:47,740
I have to protect it.

259
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:50,740
Why don't you protect it?

260
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:53,740
What are you angry about?

261
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:54,740
There are only two times.

262
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:55,740
Why don't you protect it?

263
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:56,740
There are only two times.

264
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:58,740
Why don't you protect it?

265
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:01,740
I don't care.

266
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:02,740
I don't care.

267
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:03,740
You think so.

268
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:04,740
I don't care.

269
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:05,740
It's funny.

270
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:11,740
I don't know where the time is, but the old people around there are saying,

271
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:16,740
If you do that, the number of times will increase.

272
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:18,740
The number of times will increase.

273
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:20,740
It's too cute.

274
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:23,740
There are only two times.

275
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:24,740
There are only two times.

276
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:25,740
What are you going to do?

277
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,740
I don't care.

278
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:30,740
I don't care.

279
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:35,740
There are only two times.

280
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:39,740
It stinks.

281
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:41,740
Why?

282
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:44,740
Why does it stink?

283
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:45,740
There are only two times.

284
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:48,740
I don't care.

285
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:51,740
I don't know.

286
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:53,740
Damn it!

287
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:56,740
Damn it!

288
00:13:56,740 --> 00:14:00,740
Damn it!

289
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:02,740
I don't know.

290
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:03,740
What is this?

291
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:05,740
I said I'll go.

292
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:07,740
Damn it!

293
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:09,740
Damn it!

294
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:10,740
Damn it!

295
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:12,740
Damn it!

296
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:18,740
If you can't protect it, you can protect it, but don't you protect it too much?

297
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:20,740
You make a system.

298
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:23,740
I don't care.

299
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:30,740
I can't bite it.

300
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:35,740
It's a shame.

301
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:37,740
It's a beautiful place.

302
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:39,740
It's like a panda, isn't it?

303
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:40,740
It's a great system.

304
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:42,740
It's terrible.

305
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:44,740
It's a great one-room.

306
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:47,740
It's a concrete house.

307
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:52,740
If you look at the park, it's a dirty old man sleeping on a bench.

308
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:54,740
It's rare to see an old man sitting on a bench.

309
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:57,740
You can't see it from there.

310
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:59,740
It's a stupid old man sitting on a bench.

311
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:05,740
You're all black around your eyes.

312
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:08,740
It's not something I was born with.

313
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:10,740
When I was born, I was black around my eyes.

314
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:12,740
Old man, later, later.

315
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:15,740
Little by little, little by little, I was alive.

316
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:17,740
Isn't that amazing?

317
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:19,740
It's not amazing.

318
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:23,740
The panda is cute, but it's not cute.

319
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:26,740
The old man is cuter.

320
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:28,740
It's not cute.

321
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:30,740
The old man is cute, isn't he?

322
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:34,740
The old man is like this with a cardboard box.

323
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:36,740
That's cute, isn't it?

324
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:37,740
It's cuter than a panda.

325
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:41,740
If you make a noise, it's cute.

326
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:47,740
In fact, I have a friend who has a very bad armpit smell.

327
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:49,740
Wow!

328
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:52,740
Wow! That's a wow!

329
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:55,740
He doesn't seem to have noticed that.

330
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:59,740
I can't help but want to ask him about it.

331
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:02,740
I can't help but think about his feelings.

332
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:06,740
Are you close to your acquaintance, Mr. Armpit?

333
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:11,740
No, I'm not.

334
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:12,740
Oh, I see.

335
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:15,740
If I had to say...

336
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:18,740
What are you talking about?

337
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:25,740
Don't make a big deal out of it!

338
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:30,740
This is an important post sent by a fan.

339
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:37,740
Why are you crying?

340
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:39,740
Why are you crying?

341
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:42,740
This is often the case that the person himself doesn't know.

342
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:43,740
That's right.

343
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:44,740
I don't know.

344
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:45,740
There are many people who don't know.

345
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:46,740
I don't know.

346
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:47,740
I don't know.

347
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:48,740
I don't know.

348
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:49,740
I don't know.

349
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:50,740
I don't know.

350
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:51,740
I don't know.

351
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:56,740
There are many people who don't know.

352
00:16:56,740 --> 00:17:02,740
I'm sure there are about 10 people in the audience.

353
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:03,740
I understand this.

354
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:05,740
Let's just say it.

355
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:06,740
What?

356
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:10,740
If there's someone with an armpit around you,

357
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:12,740
there's something you can't say, right?

358
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,740
It's an armpit.

359
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:16,740
This is...

360
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:19,740
Let's just say it.

361
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:22,740
Tomorrow at 10 p.m.

362
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:25,740
You should have told me sooner.

363
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:26,740
I don't have an armpit.

364
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:27,740
I don't know.

365
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:29,740
You should have told me sooner.

366
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:31,740
You should have told me sooner.

367
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:32,740
At 6 p.m.

368
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:33,740
At 6 p.m.

369
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:34,740
Tomorrow...

370
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:35,740
This is a Sunday report.

371
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:37,740
Monday evening at 6 p.m.

372
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:39,740
If there's someone with an armpit around you,

373
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:41,740
at exactly 6 p.m.

374
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:44,740
There's an armpit.

375
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:46,740
And you clap your hands.

376
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:47,740
You clap your hands.

377
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:49,740
If there's someone with an armpit around you,

378
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:50,740
at exactly 6 p.m.

379
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:53,740
Your armpit will be revealed.

380
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:55,740
If there's a woman with an armpit around you,

381
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:56,740
it'll be hard.

382
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:59,740
You can't do that to a woman with an armpit.

383
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:00,740
This is...

384
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:01,740
What?

385
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:02,740
You can't do that.

386
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:04,740
You have an armpit.

387
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:05,740
Let's just say it.

388
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:06,740
At 6 p.m.

389
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:07,740
At 6 p.m.

390
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:08,740
At 6 p.m.

391
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:12,740
You decided that.

392
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:13,740
Let's just say it.

393
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:15,740
At 6 p.m.

394
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:16,740
What?

395
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:19,740
This is interesting.

396
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:23,740
Don't put your upper lip and lower lip together when you say Hokkaido.

397
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:28,740
Hokkaido.

398
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:29,740
Even if you say it normally,

399
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:36,740
your upper lip and lower lip won't stick together.

400
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:46,740
What?

401
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:47,740
Taka-san, Taka-san.

402
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:48,740
What?

403
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:49,740
Taka-san, Taka-san.

404
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:52,740
I don't want to sit next to you.

405
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:55,740
What's wrong with you?

406
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:59,740
Taka-san seems to be having a hard time.

407
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:00,740
What are you talking about?

408
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:01,740
You and me?

409
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,740
What are you talking about?

410
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:09,740
Are you practicing?

411
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:10,740
No, I'm not.

412
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:14,740
How did you do that jump?

413
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:22,740
I'm scared, but it was pathetic.

414
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:25,740
What are you talking about?

415
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:27,740
What are you talking about?

416
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:37,740
That's why.

417
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:46,740
What's wrong with you?

418
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:50,740
I'm not saying I won't do it.

419
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:52,740
Have you been jumping since then?

420
00:19:52,740 --> 00:20:07,740
No, I haven't.

421
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,740
You can't do it either.

422
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:16,740
I can't do it either.

423
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:17,740
Ebiyan.

424
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:18,740
Ebiyan.

425
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:19,740
Ebiyan, come here.

426
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:21,740
What?

427
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:23,740
Ebiyan, come here.

428
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:25,740
Come here?

429
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:27,740
Ebiyan, come here.

430
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:30,740
Come here?

431
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:31,740
Come to the site.

432
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:35,740
Ebiyan, come here.

433
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:37,740
Come here.

434
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:39,740
Ebiyan, come here.

435
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:40,740
You can't do that.

436
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:46,740
I can't do it.

437
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:49,740
Come here.

438
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:51,740
Don't run away from me.

439
00:20:51,740 --> 00:21:19,740
Come here.
