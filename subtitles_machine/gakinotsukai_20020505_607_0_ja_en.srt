00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Gaki no Tsukai Special Project Matsumoto vs. Hamada Kokoriko

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
The race between the two will finally begin!

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
This program is brought to you by the following sponsors.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:29,000
On the day of the race, the Hamada team, who will face Matsumoto, will enter the track.

5
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
What?

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
What's going on?

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I slipped!

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Matsumoto, you slipped!

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I slipped!

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Are you okay?

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm fine.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Yamashita, you have a child.

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
You have to win this race.

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Your father is strong.

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I have a child today, so I'm going to win.

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Are you okay?

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Is it okay for me to do it here?

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
It's a big place.

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
It's a serious place.

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
On the other hand, Matsumoto, who is eager to take revenge, arrives late.

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Matsumoto vs. Hamada Kokoriko

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
On the day of the race, Matsumoto vs. Hamada Kokoriko

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:39,000
The race between the two will finally begin!

24
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,000
On the day of the race, Matsumoto vs. Hamada Kokoriko

25
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
The day of the race has come!

26
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Unfortunately, it's raining.

27
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
The weather is bad.

28
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I returned it to you a long time ago.

29
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
It was raining a lot.

30
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
It's raining a lot, so I can't go.

31
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
The rules of this race are...

32
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Matsumoto vs. Hamada Kokoriko

33
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
It's a race between two people.

34
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
It's finally here.

35
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I saw this for the first time in a long time.

36
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I can go.

37
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Really?

38
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Yes.

39
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I have a lot of room.

40
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
The place to jump out was behind me.

41
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
That's right.

42
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
This is the only place.

43
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
If you step out a little, it's over.

44
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I'll take care of the details.

45
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I saw it earlier.

46
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
He has a lot of jumping power.

47
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
That's right.

48
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
It's surprising.

49
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Please look up.

50
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
It's amazing.

51
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
It's the same.

52
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
It's the same.

53
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
It was amazing.

54
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
It was too high.

55
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
It was amazing.

56
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I could see it right away.

57
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I was scared.

58
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
It was crowded.

59
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Where?

60
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Around here.

61
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
It was crowded.

62
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
It was around here.

63
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
It was crowded like Komazawa street.

64
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Please look up again.

65
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
It's a total of four times.

66
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Matsumoto said he was confident.

67
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
As a handyman,

68
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
One of the four times is the world record.

69
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I did it.

70
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
It's hard for me to jump four times this year.

71
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Where did he go?

72
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I don't know.

73
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Matsumoto's team is the winner.

74
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
The winner is Heipo.

75
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
It's coming.

76
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Where is it?

77
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
It's going up.

78
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
It's coming.

79
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Heipo, burn.

80
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I don't want to do it.

81
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I used three days of strength today.

82
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Are you okay?

83
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Yes.

84
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I feel sick.

85
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
You feel sick?

86
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
You feel sick?

87
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I feel sick.

88
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
The viewers will feel sick even more.

89
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Let's go over there.

90
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
One by one.

91
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
That's right.

92
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Let's cheer for each other.

93
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
The four of us are fine.

94
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
The one that bothers me the most is

95
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
There's a young man in there.

96
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I'm completely down.

97
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Young man.

98
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Don't you cheer for me?

99
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I'm not cheering for you.

100
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I'm making fun of you.

101
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Each team has a coach.

102
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Yes.

103
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Let's go.

104
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
The coach of the Hamada team is

105
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
The one who can run and jump.

106
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Mr. Masaki Morinaga.

107
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Mr. Masaki.

108
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Mr. Masaki is going to jump.

109
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Mr. Masaki is going to jump.

110
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Please.

111
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Demonstration.

112
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I'm going to jump.

113
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Wow.

114
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Wow.

115
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Wow.

116
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
What was that?

117
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Wow.

118
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Are you an idiot?

119
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Amazing.

120
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
About 7 meters.

121
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
What's the record?

122
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
The current record is

123
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
7.5 meters.

124
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Wow.

125
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Amazing.

126
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
What a great coach.

127
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
He was doing this in the air.

128
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
He was walking.

129
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
He was walking.

130
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
The air time is long.

131
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Mr. Masaki Morinaga.

132
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
The record achieved in 1992,

133
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
8.25 meters,

134
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
hasn't been broken yet.

135
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
The top star of the track and field

136
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
will be the coach of the Hamada team.

137
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
He's a Japanese record holder.

138
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
You know what that means, right?

139
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
What?

140
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
World record holder?

141
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
The coach of the Matsumoto team is

142
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
this person.

143
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
He's already won.

144
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
What?

145
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
What?

146
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,000
He's already won.

147
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Wow.

148
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Wow.

149
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Wow.

150
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
You know what?

151
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
He's been laughing

152
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
the whole time.

153
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
He's still laughing.

154
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
What?

155
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
It has nothing to do with you.

156
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Why are you so interested?

157
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I failed.

158
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Look.

159
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
The coach of Matsumoto is

160
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
the producer of Luminosa Yoshimoto.

161
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
The current record is

162
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
3.30 meters.

163
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Why is it 3.30 meters?

164
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I can't get close to him.

165
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
He's not naked.

166
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I don't know.

167
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I can't get close to him.

168
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Excuse me, Mr. Matsumoto.

169
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Yes.

170
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Actually,

171
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
the World Cup is coming up.

172
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
The world is paying attention

173
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
to this match.

174
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
The Africa Central Television

175
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
is here to interview you.

176
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
He's here.

177
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
The director is the same.

178
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
He's the same.

179
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
He's here.

180
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I believe you.

181
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
The camera of Japan is here.

182
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
He's here again.

183
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
He's here.

184
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
He's here.

185
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I told him

186
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,000
to do this kind of match.

187
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I told him to do this kind of match.

188
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
He's fast.

189
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
You're fast.

190
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
You're fast.

191
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
He's angry.

192
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
He's not laughing at all.

193
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
He's angry because he doesn't have time.

194
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
He's angry because he doesn't have time.

195
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I can't do this.

196
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I can't do this.

197
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Today,

198
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I'm in perfect condition.

199
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I can jump 1.20 meters.

200
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
What are you talking about?

201
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
He's funny.

202
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
The West Indian International Television

203
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
is also here.

204
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Yes.

205
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Why is there music?

206
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
You're crazy.

207
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
You're in the way.

208
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
You're in the way when you're editing.

209
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
He's a timekeeper.

210
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:30,000
He's a timekeeper.

211
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
It's a picture of curry.

212
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
It's a TV show.

213
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
It's the West Indian.

214
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,000
It's a picture of curry.

215
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
It's a picture of curry.

216
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
It's a picture of curry.

217
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
It's a picture of curry.

218
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
You don't need to be in the picture.

219
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Why are you in the picture?

220
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Why are you in the picture?

221
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Thank you.

222
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
It's our first time to be in India.

223
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
It's our first time to be in India.

224
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Welcome.

225
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Why are you talking while you are waiting?

226
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Are you wearing a wig?

227
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Give me.

228
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
What the hell are you talking about?

229
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I'm talking about America.

230
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Don't argue with me.

231
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Hey!

232
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
What the hell are you doing?

233
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I'll do my best.

234
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
What the hell are you doing?

235
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I've been talking about Africa.

236
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I'll do my best.

237
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
What the hell?

238
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I just want to do a mini skit with you guys.

239
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Both teams go into practice under their respective coaches.

240
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,000
The Hamada team starts with a warm-up run.

241
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,000
On the other hand, Matsumoto starts with a jump training without a flexible workout.

242
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
No!

243
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
It's hard to keep your feet together, right?

244
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,000
The Hamada team goes on to the important point of practice.

245
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
The more you go up, the more your body goes up.

246
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
It looks like the floor is going to be loose.

247
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
See?

248
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
It didn't feel good.

249
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
It felt good.

250
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
It's okay.

251
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
It's okay.

252
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
It's okay.

253
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Did you get it?

254
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Did you get it?

255
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
You're amazing.

256
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
You're amazing.

257
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I can do this much.

258
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
What the hell?

259
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
The Hamada team rests their body.

260
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
The Hamada team rests their body.

261
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Can I check the rules?

262
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Can I check the rules?

263
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Can I check the rules?

264
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:56,000
For example, if you can't keep your feet together, you can't do this.

265
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I don't think so.

266
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Really?

267
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
If we burn out, it's over.

268
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
It's a great TV deck.

269
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I'm done talking.

270
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I'll ask you to get out of this tent.

271
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
It's a different place.

272
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
It's okay. I'll just burn it out.

273
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
It's the other way around.

274
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
It's the other way around.

275
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
The Hamada team gets ready for the real thing.

276
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
The Hamada team gets ready for the real thing.

277
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
A massage with concentration.

278
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
A massage with concentration.

279
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
My wife made it.

280
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Your wife made it?

281
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I can fly.

282
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
You can fly?

283
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
What?

284
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
It's not Hitoshi. It's Hiroshi.

285
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
It's not Hitoshi. It's Hiroshi.

286
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
It's me.

287
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I'm just showing my love for the tent to my parents.

288
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
The real thing is coming up.

289
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
The Hamada team is in a relaxed mood.

290
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
The tension is starting to show.

291
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Matsumoto is alone next to him.

292
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
What's the outcome of the match?

293
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
The race is about to begin.

294
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
It's about time.

295
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
It's about time.

296
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
We've been practicing.

297
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I'm a little nervous.

298
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I'm a little nervous.

299
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I'm a little nervous.

300
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
It's hard to play tag for 48 hours.

301
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
It's hard to play tag for 48 hours.

302
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
It's hard to play tag for 48 hours.

303
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
It's like he has a lot of demons.

304
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
It's hard to play tag for 48 hours.

305
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
It's like he has a lot of demons.

306
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I've been bitten.

307
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
He has more demons.

308
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
He has more demons.

309
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
It's hard.

310
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
The Hamada team has Yamasaki, Endo, Tanaka and Hamada.

311
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
The Matsumoto team is in the lead in the third place.

312
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
First of all, the Hamada team has Yamasaki.

313
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Please give me a round of applause.

314
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Let's go!

315
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Wow!

316
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Let's go!

317
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Let's go!

318
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Team Hamada's first challenger is Yamasaki.

319
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
What kind of challenge will he show in this tense atmosphere?

320
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Let's go!

321
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Let's go!

322
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Let's go!

323
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Nice jump!

324
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Okay, okay.

325
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Did I reach the ceiling?

326
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
The ceiling.

327
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Did I pass the checkpoint?

328
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
No, there's no checkpoint.

329
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
The current record is...

330
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
4 meters.

331
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Yes!

332
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
4 meters?

333
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
You did it!

334
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
No way!

335
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Okay, Matsumoto-san.

336
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I think it was the best practice.

337
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Really?

338
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Including practice.

339
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I think it was the best practice.

340
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I know, I know.

341
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Wait a minute!

342
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Wait!

343
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Thank you.

344
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
If that's the case,

345
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I have an average score,

346
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
so I can't exceed 4 meters at this point.

347
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Are you serious?

348
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Yes.

349
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Matsumoto's expression

350
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
is all over the place

351
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
in Yamasaki's record.

352
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
That was a nice jump.

353
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
It was a really nice jump.

354
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
He jumped better than me.

355
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Matsumoto's record is 4.5 meters.

356
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
He jumped really far.

357
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
He jumped really far.

358
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I think it's about 4.5 meters.

359
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
It's about 1.0 meters.

360
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
That's amazing.

361
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
That's amazing.

362
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
He jumped really far.

363
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
He jumped really far.

364
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I think it's about 4.5 meters.

365
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
That's amazing.

366
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
That's amazing.

367
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Tadaiwa's record is 4.53 meters.

368
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Yes!

369
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
That was a nice jump.

370
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
That was a nice jump.

371
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
He was really focused.

372
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
It felt like there was no one else

373
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
doing it alone.

374
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Let's go to the second round.

375
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Let's go to the second round.

376
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Let's go!

377
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Hamada's team.

378
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
The second person is Endo.

379
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
How far is it?

380
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
It's about 4 meters.

381
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Everyone, don't go!

382
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
It's about 4 meters.

383
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Tadaiwa's record is 4.27 meters.

384
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
That's amazing.

385
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
That's amazing.

386
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
That's amazing.

387
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
He jumped really far.

388
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
That's amazing.

389
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
That's amazing.

390
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Matsumoto's second jump.

391
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Matsumoto's second jump.

392
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
He's just scratching his chest.

393
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I'd like to extend the record a little

394
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
and make a difference.

395
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Let's go!

396
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
He jumped!

397
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
He jumped!

398
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
He jumped!

399
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
He jumped!

400
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
He jumped!

401
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
He jumped!

402
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
He jumped!

403
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Tadaiwa's record is 4.65 meters.

404
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
That's amazing.

405
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
That's amazing.

406
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
That's amazing.

407
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
That's amazing.

408
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
That's amazing.

409
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
It's a world of 6 meters.

410
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
It's a world of 6 meters.

411
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
It's okay.

412
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
It's okay.

413
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Matsumoto's jumping really well.

414
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Matsumoto's jumping really well.

415
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
It's amazing.

416
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Hamada's team.

417
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
The third person is Tanaka.

418
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Relax.

419
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Heijyoshi

420
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I'll do my best for the second round.

421
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Let's go!

422
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Let's go!

423
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
He jumped!

424
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
He jumped!

425
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
He jumped!

426
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
He jumped!

427
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
He jumped!

428
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
He jumped!

429
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
He jumped!

430
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
He jumped!

431
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
He jumped!

432
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
This is not good.

433
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
The current record is 4m40cm.

434
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Wait a minute.

435
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
This is not good.

436
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
You didn't jump the most.

437
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
That's right.

438
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I wanted to jump in a big way.

439
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Why did you think so much?

440
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
You don't have to think about it.

441
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
You don't have to think about it.

442
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
You can jump normally.

443
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I wanted to jump in a big way.

444
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
You didn't jump in a big way.

445
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I wanted to jump in a big way.

446
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Everyone, be quiet.

447
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I'm in the image training.

448
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Concentration.

449
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Finally, the problem is solved.

450
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I'm going.

451
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Go.

452
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I did it.

453
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I did it.

454
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I did it.

455
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I did it.

456
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I did it.

457
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I did it.

458
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I did it.

459
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I did it.

460
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I did it.

461
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
The current record is 2m87cm.

462
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Good.

463
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
As practiced.

464
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Good.

465
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
It took a long time.

466
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
It took a long time.

467
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
The drama of waiting was waiting.

468
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
This is amazing.

469
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Hama, please.

470
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Next is Hama.

471
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
The current record is 62cm.

472
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:33,000
So far, Matsumoto has jumped more than 4m50cm twice.

473
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
I can't let my guard down.

474
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
This is a place where I show my determination as a captain.

475
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Please hold it.

476
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I did it.

477
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I did it.

478
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
I did it.

479
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I did it.

480
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
This is a very good game.

481
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:10,000
The current record is 4m16cm.

482
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
That's too hard.

483
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I did it.

484
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I did it.

485
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I did it.

486
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I did it.

487
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I did it.

488
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Matsumoto.

489
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
You can jump 4m80cm, right?

490
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Yes.

491
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
I'm angry because I'm worried.

492
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
I'm very worried.

493
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I'm doing my best for you.

494
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
I'm sorry.

495
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Crying or laughing, this is the last leap.

496
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:51,000
If you jump 4m79cm here, it will be a miracle reversal.

497
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
4m79cm.

498
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:59,000
As far as I've seen the record so far, it's not an impossible number.

499
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:06,000
At that time, Matsumoto took a long run from the starting point.

500
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Will this strategy succeed?

501
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I'm going.

502
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
It's your turn.

503
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:46,000
I'm tired.

504
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
I'm doing pretty well.

505
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
I'm counting on you.

506
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:01,000
The current record is 4m56cm.

507
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
I did it.

508
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I did it.

509
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:10,000
I did it.

510
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I want to jump again.

511
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
I'm different now.

512
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
What are you?

513
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
I'm sorry.

514
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Matsumoto will be punished.

515
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:35,000
I can't accept it.

516
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:45,000
The six men had a match.

517
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,000
The result was a victory for the Hamada team.

518
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Matsumoto, who keeps screaming with his shoulders down, will face a cruel punishment game that no one has ever experienced.

519
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:19,000
This program was provided by the following sponsors.
