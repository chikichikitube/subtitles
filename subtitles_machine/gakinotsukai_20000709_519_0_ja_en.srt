00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
In the first episode of Gaki no Tsukai, Chikishiki's newlyweds are here!

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Has it started?

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
What kind of newlyweds are coming tonight?

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Only hot couples can do this

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Say something!

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm really looking forward to it!

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
This broadcast is brought to you by the sponsors you see

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Please decide on a line

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Okay

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I got it

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Amada-kun, will you cut it off for me?

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
You!

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
You!

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
How many years have you been doing this?

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
You!

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
First, let's have the husband come out!

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Shinkan-san, welcome!

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
The father is coming!

19
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Fujiwara Hiroshi, the manager of Yoshimoto Kogyo, has been making a lot of laughs on this show

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
And suddenly, there's a rumor that he's getting married

21
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
He's usually very serious about marriage

22
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
What is the truth behind this marriage?

23
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Please introduce yourself!

24
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I'm from Setagaya

25
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Fujiwara Hiroshi, 31 years old

26
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Shinkan-san?

27
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm getting married this week

28
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I can't believe that I have a character when I'm on this show

29
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
That's amazing

30
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
The father is coming!

31
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
It's a big rumor

32
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
It's the story of a middle schooler

33
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
What kind of person is your wife?

34
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Well, she's kind of cute

35
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Where did you meet her?

36
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
We were in the company of Yoshimoto Kogyo

37
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Is she from Yabasaki?

38
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
She was my manager

39
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I know her very well

40
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
What kind of person is she like in the entertainment industry?

41
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Please tell us

42
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Well, in terms of the atmosphere...

43
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
She's like Wakui Emi

44
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
That's not true!

45
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
That's not true!

46
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
That's not true!

47
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
You can't say that!

48
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Do you think she's Wakui Emi?

49
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I've never seen Wakui Emi as my manager

50
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Well, it's about time

51
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Let's call Wakui Emi

52
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Let's call Wakui Emi

53
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Let's do it

54
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Welcome the bride!

55
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Please come in

56
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
She said she's cute

57
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Please introduce yourself

58
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I'm Hiroshi Fujiwara's wife

59
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Fujiwara...

60
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Wife?

61
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Wife?

62
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I'm Fujiwara Junko, 27 years old

63
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I'm currently a housewife

64
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
You're the wife of Yamada?

65
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Yes

66
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
First, we'll look at the photos of the two happy people

67
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
First, we'll look at the photos of the two happy people

68
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
We'll start with Hiroshi Fujiwara

69
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
He was born on the 10th of December, 1943 in Osaku

70
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
He was born on the 10th of December, 1943 in Osaku

71
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
He was born on the 10th of December, 1943 in Osaku

72
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
There's a photo of him as a child

73
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
He grew up as a dad

74
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Then from the 5th of the 6th grade when he was in junior high school

75
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Then from the 5th of the 6th grade when he was in junior high school

76
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Landed top on the books

77
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Unbelievable

78
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Hollow eyes

79
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Hollow eyes

80
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
What are you looking at?

81
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I don't get it.

82
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
What happened?

83
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I think he passed high school or something like that.

84
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
And...

85
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
He looks like a serious boy who only studies.

86
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
But there was another scene like this.

87
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
What was that?

88
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
BAM!

89
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Oh!

90
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
This guy is annoying!

91
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
What is this?

92
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
What is this?

93
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Of course it's Fujiwara-san.

94
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
This is bad.

95
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
This...

96
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
What is this?

97
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
This is a cram school.

98
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
A cram school?

99
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
A cram school.

100
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I went to cram school to play.

101
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
What's so funny?

102
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
It's embarrassing.

103
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Are you going to get scolded?

104
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
It's embarrassing.

105
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Don't laugh at anything.

106
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
It's embarrassing.

107
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Do you all think this is a shooting range?

108
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
It's not like that.

109
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
We're all friends.

110
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
But your name is Okada-gumi, right?

111
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Yes.

112
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Okada-gumi.

113
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
It's called Okada-gumi.

114
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Okada-gumi the killer.

115
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Okada-gumi the killer.

116
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
What is this?

117
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
What is this?

118
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I'm going to kill you in secret.

119
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
What is this, Okada-gumi?

120
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
It's a scary group.

121
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I'm going to kill you in secret.

122
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I'm going to kill you in secret.

123
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I'm finally going to enter high school.

124
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I've been looking forward to high school since this time.

125
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I was very popular among women.

126
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Really?

127
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Yes.

128
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I have a picture.

129
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Here it is.

130
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Oh, it's broken.

131
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
It's completely broken.

132
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
It's like that.

133
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Your lips are like that.

134
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
It's like that.

135
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
It's like that.

136
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
And then,

137
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I'm in my third year of elementary school.

138
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I'm going to study at Kansai University.

139
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I have a picture of that time.

140
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Here it is.

141
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
What is this?

142
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
What is this?

143
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Why are you suddenly like this?

144
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I'm suddenly like this.

145
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Next, my wife.

146
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
My name is Junko.

147
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I'm in my fourth year of elementary school.

148
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I was born five years later.

149
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I was born on May 3rd.

150
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I was born in the residential area of Kansai, Tokyo.

151
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I'm always behind my wife.

152
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I'm a shy girl.

153
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Here it is.

154
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Here it is.

155
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
It's cute.

156
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
But,

157
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:55,000
You look like a rich person.

158
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
That's right.

159
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Did you go to an elementary school in Eitoko?

160
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I went to a private school.

161
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
So you like escalators.

162
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
That's right.

163
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I don't understand what you're saying.

164
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
You like escalators, don't you?

165
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
You like escalators.

166
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
You like escalators, don't you?

167
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
But,

168
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
You look like a quiet person.

169
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
But you also look like Masashi.

170
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
You wanted to wear a bra.

171
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
So you put on a bra.

172
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
And you put a tennis ball in your chest.

173
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
And you look like Masashi.

174
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Did you do that?

175
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Yes, I did.

176
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Even if you don't do that now,

177
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
What will happen to a strong person?

178
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
A strong person.

179
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Please stop it.

180
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Stop it.

181
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
In the fourth year of Heisei,

182
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,000
She went to a university of modern culture.

183
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
She had a great time studying there.

184
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Here is a picture of her.

185
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Here it is.

186
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Wonderful.

187
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
She is thin.

188
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
She is thin.

189
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
This is a picture of her when she was thin.

190
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
They put on a bra.

191
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
This is a picture of a fizzy.

192
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,000
She has a piece of her head.

193
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I can't see that.

194
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
She has white hair.

195
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
She looks like a spirit.

196
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
She looks like a fresh spirit.

197
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
She is beautiful.

198
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I'm sure she is popular.

199
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I think she is popular.

200
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
She has done many things including the fizzy.

201
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Who did you go with?

202
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I went with my sister.

203
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Ah, so you went with your sister.

204
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
You got a lot of calls, didn't you?

205
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Hiji didn't do that.

206
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Hiji didn't do that?

207
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
What about the others?

208
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Hawaii, Guam, Phuket...

209
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
There were a lot of men there.

210
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
How was it around there?

211
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Hawaii was in a good mood.

212
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
In a good mood?

213
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Hawaii was in a good mood?

214
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Hawaii was in a good mood?

215
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
What are you talking about?

216
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
What are you talking about?

217
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
What are you talking about?

218
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
There were times when we were in a good mood.

219
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
No rubber, no rubber.

220
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I've introduced the two of them.

221
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
We have a photo of the couple getting married.

222
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
We have a photo of the couple getting married.

223
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Please take a look.

224
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
First, a picture of the wife.

225
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Ishikawa family.

226
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
A young lady.

227
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
This is a back...

228
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
This is a piano.

229
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
This is amazing.

230
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
This is a photo of a foreigner on top of the piano.

231
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
It's an old man.

232
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
It's an old man.

233
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
On the other hand, this is Fujiwara's family.

234
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
On the other hand, this is Fujiwara's family.

235
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
You look like your father.

236
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
My father is a village director.

237
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
He's a famous director.

238
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
He's a village director.

239
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
He's a village director.

240
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
He's a village director.

241
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
He's a village director.

242
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
It's time to ask the two of them how they got used to each other.

243
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
What made you two date?

244
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
We worked in Osaka for three years.

245
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
After that, we moved to Tokyo.

246
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I see.

247
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I became Yamazaki's manager.

248
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I became a child's employee.

249
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I became a child's employee.

250
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I became a child's employee.

251
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
After that, I ate a little.

252
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
With two people?

253
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
With two people?

254
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Who's the manager?

255
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
What's with the members?

256
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Are you a group?

257
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
After recording, you decided to go to a dinner party?

258
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Yes.

259
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Did something happen there?

260
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I said,

261
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I said,

262
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I said,

263
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I said,

264
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I said,

265
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I said,

266
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I said,

267
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
After that,

268
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Did you hear me say that?

269
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
It was� Yoichi Beckham's birthday on December 10th.

270
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
It was Yoichi Beckham's birthday on December 10th.

271
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I thought that it would be good to go to a dinner party.

272
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I thought that it would be good to go to a dinner party.

273
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I thought that it would be good to go to a dinner party.

274
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
That was the first time that the two of them met?

275
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Yes, it was our first conversation like that.

276
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Sis, what was he like when you first heard that?

277
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
What did he look like?

278
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I thought he was joking, but after that, he called me.

279
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
In private...

280
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
You're a light person.

281
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
When we were going out, he suddenly said,

282
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Don't do bad things today.

283
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
It's a feeling of a lover.

284
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
It's embarrassing.

285
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
It's embarrassing.

286
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
It's not a bad thing. We're not dating.

287
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
It's a feeling of a lover.

288
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
It's embarrassing.

289
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Why are you standing up?

290
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Reflect on yourself.

291
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
He's a bit of a snob.

292
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
It's amazing.

293
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Women tend to be a bit of a snob.

294
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
That's true.

295
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I thought he was a good person.

296
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,000
He said he was a good person, but I couldn't go to work that day.

297
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:50,000
After the meeting, I called him late at night.

298
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I'm really sorry about today.

299
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
He picked up the phone and went to the bathroom.

300
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
In the bathroom?

301
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Yes, in the bathroom.

302
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I asked him why he was in the bathroom.

303
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,000
He said he didn't want to be filmed.

304
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Why?

305
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
It's embarrassing.

306
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Is that true?

307
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Is that true?

308
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Yes.

309
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Are you stupid?

310
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I was waiting for your call.

311
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I couldn't go to work on December 10th.

312
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:27,000
The day after that, I had a TV show special.

313
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I thought I'd have a meal after that.

314
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
What did you eat?

315
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I had a meal with four people.

316
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Kimoto, Katayama, and I went to eat teppanyaki.

317
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I went to a different place with Kimoto.

318
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
You didn't go.

319
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
There was still Katayama left.

320
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
What was he doing?

321
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Katayama and I were going in the same direction, so he asked me to take the same taxi home.

322
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
But I said I had to go to work early.

323
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
You went home early.

324
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I thought I had no choice today.

325
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:25,000
When I got home, I got a phone call.

326
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I was told to go home.

327
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
You were told you couldn't go home?

328
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I was told I could go home.

329
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
You were told you could go home?

330
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
You were so motivated.

331
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I was so motivated.

332
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,000
You were doing everything in Hawaii.

333
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
You didn't have any rubber.

334
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I was told to go home because I was late.

335
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Your approach was amazing at the end.

336
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Did you decide to go home today?

337
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I decided to go home today.

338
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Really?

339
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Really?

340
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
You didn't go out with anyone, did you?

341
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
No.

342
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
You didn't go out with anyone, but you decided to go home today?

343
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I couldn't go home on my birthday.

344
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I didn't have any plans for the next day.

345
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I decided to go home on the 12th.

346
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I decided to go home today.

347
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
When are you going to take off your underwear?

348
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
When are you going to take off your underwear?

349
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
It was written in the diary.

350
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
When are you going to take off your underwear?

351
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I couldn't take off my underwear today.

352
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Smart.

353
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
You were so motivated, but you decided to go home.

354
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I decided to go home today.

355
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
You were still so energetic.

356
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Yes.

357
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
When it was time to go home, you told me to go home.

358
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Go home.

359
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Did you decide to go home today?

360
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
No.

361
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I was worried that my room would be dirty.

362
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Who are you going to introduce it to?

363
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Well, it's dirty but I'm sorry

364
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
When we were talking about something

365
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I suddenly got kissed

366
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
This is amazing!

367
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Really?

368
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I knew it!

369
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:41,000
So what do you want me to do while I'm dead?

370
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I'm sorry

371
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
What do you want me to do while I'm dead?

372
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I don't like it

373
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
What do you want me to do while I'm dead?

374
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I want you to kiss me, calm down and think about it

375
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
That's too much!

376
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
That's too much!

377
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
But if you kiss a woman, you might get hurt

378
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
You have to be brave

379
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
When I went home

380
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I thought she was expecting it

381
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Of course it's a little embarrassing to go first

382
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
But even if I talked to her for a long time

383
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,000
She didn't do anything

384
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000
What is this?

385
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Why are you talking like that?

386
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Why?

387
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Don't you understand?

388
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I felt sorry for her

389
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I felt sorry for her

390
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
What are you doing?

391
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Do you want a commercial?

392
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
When is it going to be?

393
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:04,000
The next time I went, I did it myself

394
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
How many days after that?

395
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Three days after that

396
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Where was it?

397
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
At home

398
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
One more point

399
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
How was it?

400
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
When you finally got married

401
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
From your wife's point of view

402
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Finally

403
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:30,000
How was it? Did you feel good?

404
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
To a man

405
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
A man and a woman

406
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I don't think this man can feel that good

407
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I don't think so

408
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I've been there for a long time

409
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I've been there for a long time

410
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
How was it?

411
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I think she's happy

412
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
She's happy

413
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
You two know each other

414
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Do you have a strange hobby?

415
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I think she's happy

416
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I'm going to puke

417
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I'm going to puke

418
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I'm not in the mood for this.

419
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I'm not in the mood for this.

420
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
If you're still mad, you're still a ***.

421
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Who?

422
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Not there!

423
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Not there!

424
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Hey, you guys, stop!

425
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
We're not like that, right?

426
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
We're not like that, right?

427
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
We both said that, right?

428
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
We both said that, right?

429
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
We know you're here to protect us, right?

430
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
We know you're here to protect us, right?

431
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
We know you're here to protect us, right?

432
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
We know you're here to protect us, right?

433
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Love Love Pair Match!

434
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
It's a 3-way match.

435
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
We'll have Mr. Fujiwara, Mr. Otsuka, and Mr. Fujiwara.

436
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Please choose your number.

437
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
I'll choose number 1.

438
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Number 1!

439
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
What?

440
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
What?

441
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
You should avoid this.

442
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I'll choose number 2.

443
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Number 2!

444
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Number 11.

445
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Yes!

446
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
This is good.

447
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Let's get this.

448
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Number?

449
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Number 13.

450
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
It's been a year.

451
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
It's here.

452
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
It's the last one.

453
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Let's go.

454
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Number 2.

455
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Number 13.

456
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
It's been a year.

457
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
It's been a year.

458
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
It's been a year.

459
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Let's go.

460
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Number 15.

461
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Number 15!

462
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
It's here.

463
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
By the way, what did you get?

464
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
I used it.

465
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Really?

466
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Is this it?

467
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
The flash doesn't work at all.

468
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Only one person got the flash.

469
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Only one person got the flash.

470
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Number 5.

471
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Number 5.

472
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Please choose number 5.

473
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Let's go.

474
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
It's the last one.

475
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
It's the last one.

476
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
After this, Mr. Fujiwara got the sporting bike.

477
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
After this, Mr. Fujiwara got the sporting bike.

478
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
He got the NES100C.

479
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
He got the NES100C.

480
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
He got the NES100C.

481
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Number 7.

482
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Number 7?

483
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Number 1.

484
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Number 1?

485
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Number 1!

486
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
This is a present for all of you!

487
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:23,000
This is a present for all of you!

488
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
You bastard!

489
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Ouch!

490
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Ouch!

491
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Ouch!

492
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
He hit me like this.

493
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
What did he say?

494
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
I don't know.

495
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
But this is the end.

496
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
But this is the end.

497
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
But this is the end.

498
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
I'm sorry.

499
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
I'm sorry.

500
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
This is the end.

501
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
This is the end.

502
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Here, from the shining estelle with trust and quality,

503
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Here, from the shining estelle with trust and quality,

504
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
He got the diamond fashion ring.

505
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
And, when he was excited,

506
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
He got the present from the program, the wide television.

507
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
And, when he was excited,

508
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
He got the present from the program, the wide television.

509
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
And, the final prize is?

510
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
And, the final prize is?

511
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Please open it!

512
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Please open it!

513
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
It's a pity.

514
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
It's a pity.

515
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
It's a pity.

516
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
He got 4.

517
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
He got 4.

518
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I didn't know.

519
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Now, please give the prize to Bin-chan!

520
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
It's coming again.

521
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
It's coming again.

522
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:43,000
It's coming again.
