00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
In the second episode of Gachi no Tsukai, we are going to make a scary movie!

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Today is the second episode of Gachi no Tsukai, so let's explain to those who haven't seen the first episode.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
It's very simple.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:31,000
There is a kid in the back, and we are going to make him cry.

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Last time, I played the role of Mr. Yawa.

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Mr. Yawa?

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I played the role of Mr. Yawa in the movie, PUNCH BOMBER.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
He didn't cry at all.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
That's right. Can we see it?

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Oh, let's do that.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Mr. Matsumoto, go ahead.

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
He's crying, but he's not crying.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Mr. Matsumoto, go ahead.

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Don't cry.

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Don't cry.

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
What are you doing?

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Don't cry.

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
There are six of us.

19
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:29,000
There are six of us, plus Mr. Toshihide.

20
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Please say something to Mr. Toshihide.

21
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Mr. Toshihide, don't be silly.

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Now that we're ready, let's start with Mr. Hamada.

23
00:01:45,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Mr. Hamada, go ahead.

24
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I'm scared.

25
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I'm sorry.

26
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
We're going home.

27
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I'm calling you.

28
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I'm sorry.

29
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I'll call you Matsumoto.

30
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I'll do my best.

31
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Thank you.

32
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Mr. Matsumoto is here.

33
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I'm completely ignored.

34
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I'm hated after all.

35
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Can't you be an idol of a little girl?

36
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Now, Mr. Matsumoto is here.

37
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Let's go.

38
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Mr. Matsumoto, go ahead.

39
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Are there any bad kids?

40
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Are there any bad kids?

41
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
There are sweets.

42
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Sweets.

43
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Are there any bad kids?

44
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Are you scared?

45
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Are you scared?

46
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Are there any bad kids?

47
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Are you scared?

48
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Thank you very much.

49
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Are there any bad kids?

50
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I was scared.

51
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I was scared for a moment.

52
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,000
There was a girl who was crying.

53
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
There was a boy.

54
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Are there any bad kids?

55
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
He was crying.

56
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
He was looking at you from behind.

57
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
You're stupid.

58
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Were you scared?

59
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Not really.

60
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Was it Yu-chan?

61
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
No, it wasn't Yu-chan.

62
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Everyone is talking about Tatsumi.

63
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Aya-chan?

64
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
He's a good guy.

65
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Do it.

66
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Yay!

67
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Do it more energetically.

68
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Yay!

69
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
He's doing it.

70
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
He's like a child.

71
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Ladies and gentlemen.

72
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Thank you very much.

73
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
So, what are we going to do today?

74
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I dressed up today.

75
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I just wanted you to laugh.

76
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I understand that you don't like it.

77
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
But you can't help but think that you've done it.

78
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
No, no, no.

79
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
It's not like that.

80
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
If I had dressed up properly, I would have laughed.

81
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:30,000
But I'm dressed up in a fashionable way.

82
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
You're a bit of a businessman.

83
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I'm a businessman.

84
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I have a bit of a CX.

85
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I also make a polo shirt collar.

86
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
My staff is also wearing it.

87
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
And TLS is a bit smaller.

88
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
It's hot.

89
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Oh, is it?

90
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
It's very cold.

91
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Recently, I have to think a little more about the heating.

92
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Oh, really?

93
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
It's extremely hot.

94
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Extremely hot.

95
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
You have to tell me clearly.

96
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I don't know how to reply.

97
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
What do you mean?

98
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
It's extremely hot.

99
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Suddenly.

100
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Yes.

101
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,000
It's extremely hot.

102
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I can't catch it.

103
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I wonder why.

104
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I can't do it at the right temperature.

105
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
What temperature is it now?

106
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Outside.

107
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
If it comes in from outside, it will be cold.

108
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
It would be strange if it was this hot.

109
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
That's definitely wrong.

110
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Don't you think so?

111
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Is that so?

112
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I thought it was a bullet train.

113
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I'm angry.

114
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
The bullet train is hot.

115
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
What is it?

116
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I think I'm going to get a cold.

117
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
It's hot.

118
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I've never done that before.

119
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Show me this time.

120
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
That's strange.

121
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
You have to think about it.

122
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
There must be a person who is cold.

123
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
You have to think about things around that person.

124
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
If the grandmother is in a car like this,

125
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I can't help it.

126
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
The grandmother is.

127
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
The grandmother is really cold.

128
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
There's nothing I can do about it.

129
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
How many times have I killed my grandmother?

130
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
It's so hot.

131
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I'm sleeping in the cooler.

132
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
It's so hot.

133
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I can't stop it.

134
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Why don't you stop it?

135
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
It's so cold.

136
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
It's not cold at all.

137
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
It's not cold.

138
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I'm getting a cold.

139
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Because it's hot.

140
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
That's right.

141
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I'm getting a cold.

142
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I'm getting a cold.

143
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
It's not cold.

144
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I feel sick.

145
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I'm sick too.

146
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
That's right.

147
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
That's right.

148
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
That's right.

149
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I'm sick.

150
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I'm sick.

151
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I'm sick.

152
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I'm sick.

153
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I'm sick.

154
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
It's really hot.

155
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I think humans have gotten a lot weaker.

156
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
You can't get a cold, can you?

157
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
The old humans were healthier.

158
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
That's why I've been living a normal life since the time there were no colds or heat waves.

159
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
You know what?

160
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
What is it?

161
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
It's the temperature.

162
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
What is it? I don't get it.

163
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
What is the temperature?

164
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
It's the temperature of the human being.

165
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Oh, I see.

166
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
No, no, no.

167
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
That's not true.

168
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
You're lying.

169
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
It's Hama-chan's fault.

170
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
If you say so, I'll have to work twice as hard.

171
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
We've always been partners, right?

172
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
After all, there are times when you get annoyed no matter what you do.

173
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
So we're like that, too.

174
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
There's a rhythm, isn't there?

175
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
There's a combination that's been running with a bad rhythm all the time.

176
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I'm sure there were times when it was good.

177
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Oh, yeah?

178
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
What do you mean?

179
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
You're wrong about that, aren't you?

180
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
If it were us, it would be funny and we'd say,

181
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:08,000
You're so annoying.

182
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
There are times like that.

183
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
There are.

184
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
So don't say,

185
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Stop it.

186
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
That's right.

187
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Don't say that.

188
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
That's right.

189
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
That's not funny.

190
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
That's right.

191
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
That's not funny.

192
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
That's what you say.

193
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
That's what you say.

194
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
That's not funny.

195
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I don't know if I should tell you a little bit.

196
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
That's not how you say it.

197
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
That's right.

198
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
That's why I'm so sick of you.

199
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Hey!

200
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
That's what you do.

201
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Hey!

202
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I'm so angry when I smoke.

203
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Why?

204
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Why do you smoke?

205
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
You're already done, aren't you?

206
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
That's right.

207
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
That's right.

208
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Hey!

209
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
What's wrong with him?

210
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
That's amazing.

211
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I thought so.

212
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
It's hard to do something in the dressing room.

213
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I'm sleeping and I'm sick and I'm sick.

214
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Hey!

215
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
That's what you say.

216
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
It's the same as an outcast.

217
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Outcast.

218
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
That's why I'm sick of you.

219
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
The waves are scary, aren't they?

220
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
The waves.

221
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
That's why I'm telling you to breathe together.

222
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
That way, it's hard to get out of the ship.

223
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
That's why I'm sleeping.

224
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I'm sick of you.

225
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Hey!

226
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:36,000
That's right

227
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I'm sorry.

228
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
But I'm not, you know?

229
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I'm also sick of you,

230
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
but I didn't do what could piss you off.

231
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Hey!

232
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I don't have that. I'm not that kind of person.

233
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
What?

234
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
What's wrong with me?

235
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I usually don't care, but when I talk on stage like this,

236
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I smell like food I ate during lunch.

237
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
It stinks.

238
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
When I'm angry, it's a lot.

239
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
It's like, wow!

240
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
What did you eat?

241
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I'm like, wait, wait, you're fine.

242
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I'll just say it.

243
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
What did you eat?

244
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
What's wrong with you?

245
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I'm like, wow!

246
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
What's wrong with you?

247
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I can't move.

248
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I can't move.

249
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I can't move and get hit.

250
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I can't move and get hit.

251
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
That hurts strangely.

252
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Yes, yes, yes.

253
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
It's really hard.

254
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Really.

255
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
There's a lot.

256
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
But I think it's the same for both couples.

257
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
It's been a long time.

258
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
It's been a long time.

259
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I've been doing this for 11 years.

260
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I'm a comedian.

261
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
That's enough.

262
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
The other day, on February 14th,

263
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I was listening to the radio.

264
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
There was a take-off of Yoshida Eisaku.

265
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Who is that?

266
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Yoshida Eisaku, the most popular comedian.

267
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
There's someone like that.

268
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
In the program, Yoshida Eisaku said,

269
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I'm grateful for the fans.

270
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
But these days,

271
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I've got about 10,000 fans.

272
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
About this.

273
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I've got 10,000 fans.

274
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
What do you think about this?

275
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I'm sorry.

276
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
But Yoshida Eisaku.

277
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
There's a flow of fans.

278
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I don't think I'm going to come here from such a place.

279
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I think it's rare for Yoshida Eisaku to come to my house.

280
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
There was something like this.

281
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I've been thinking about you for a year.

282
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I'll switch to Masaharu Fukuyama.

283
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I'll continue to support you as I have done so far.

284
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I'm sorry, Machan.

285
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I'm sorry, Machan.

286
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Goodbye.

287
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:36,000
The quiz challenge corner.

288
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Melonpan and Shokupan were walking down the street.

289
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
If you say,

290
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Which side will you turn?

291
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Shokupan, the answer is Mimi.

292
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:49,000
That's it.

293
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Boo.

294
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Yay, yay, yay.

295
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
If it's Boo, it's Boo.

296
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Tell me the answer.

297
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Tell me the answer.

298
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,000
The answer is Shokupan.

299
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
It's Shokupan, isn't it?

300
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
It's Shokupan.

301
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
The answer is correct.

302
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
It's correct, but it's called interpretation.

303
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
That's different.

304
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
No, it's because I have an ear.

305
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
It doesn't matter if it's Mimi.

306
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
No, no, no.

307
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:27,000
No, there's no reason for that.

308
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
No, no, it's not.

309
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
If the interpretation doesn't matter, it's Shokupan.

310
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
It's Boo, isn't it?

311
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
It would have been nice if you said Shokupan.

312
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
If you did that, you would have passed.

313
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
No, it's because I have an ear.

314
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
It doesn't matter if it's Mimi.

315
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
It doesn't matter if it's Shokupan.

316
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,000
For example, Mr. Koji Ota and Mr. Takashi Yoshihara.

317
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,000
When I read it, Mr. Takashi Yoshihara turned away and Mr. Koji Ota didn't turn away.

318
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Why did Mr. Takashi Yoshihara turn away?

319
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
There's no reason for that.

320
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
No, it's because I have an ear.

321
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:08,000
No, it's because I have an ear.

322
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
No, it's because I have an ear.

323
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
It doesn't matter if it's Mimi.

324
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:21,000
It doesn't matter at all.

325
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I don't think the ear groove is convincing.

326
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I don't think it's useful.

327
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
It's just that it takes a lot of effort to gather the earlobes.

328
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
What is the ear groove?

329
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:37,000
The ear groove is the upper part.

330
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Wouldn't it be strange if all the earlobes were extended?

331
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Why is it strange?

332
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
It's not strange if everyone does that.

333
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:51,000
It's because I have an ear.

334
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Oh, it's like this.

335
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:00,000
It's because I have an ear.

336
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
It's just that it takes a lot of effort to gather the earlobes.

337
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
It's there to accumulate.

338
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:10,000
This is making air resistance.

339
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
So, this plays the role of a parachute.

340
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:20,000
If this doesn't happen, humans will walk at a very high speed.

341
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
It's just a few millimeters round.

342
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Let's not go too fast by collecting wind here.

343
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Let's do it!

344
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
It's already ringing, isn't it?

345
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Do you understand?

346
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Of course I do.

347
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
The speed at which you are walking is not the original speed.

348
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Actually, the power here is just to walk faster.

349
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Even though it generates power, it is protected by this ear.

350
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
If you don't do that, it's no good.

351
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
A problem has arisen.

352
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
What kind of problem has arisen?

353
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:07,000
After all, it is an economic problem.

354
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
If you walk too fast, you will have an economic problem.

355
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I see.

356
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
What does this mean?

357
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I don't know.

358
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I don't think I can understand it even if I say it.

359
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
No, no, no.

360
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
You can't say it.

361
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Well, it's okay to say it.

362
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
It's going to be very difficult.

363
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I don't care.

364
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Can you say it in English?

365
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I'll try to do it somehow.

366
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I don't like it if it takes too long.

367
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
No, no, no.

368
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I'm counting on you.

369
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Please.

370
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Put it on the table.

371
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:53,000
First of all, by walking, the air accumulates.

372
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:58,000
That kind of thing doesn't mean anything.

373
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
It's impossible.

374
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
And then, what do you call it?

375
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
First of all, first of all.

376
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
First of all, money.

377
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
What kind of first of all?

378
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I'll tell you now.

379
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
First of all, there is money.

380
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
What kind of money?

381
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
What kind of money?

382
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Booking.

383
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Who is booking?

384
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
What kind of booking?

385
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
It's a professor who looks at what he knows.

386
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Tettare.

387
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Tettare.

388
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Tettare has nothing to do with it.

389
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Booking of Tettare.

390
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Tereko Tereko.

391
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Moro Moro.

392
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:47,000
When you won the marathon, what was that strange hat made of leaves?

393
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Is it some kind of secret?

394
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
What is that?

395
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Gekkeiju?

396
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Gekkeiju.

397
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
It's a leaf of Gekkeiju, isn't it?

398
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,000
In the end, it's a leaf of Gekkeiju.

399
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
It's a leaf of Gekkeiju.

400
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Well, if you have time for plants.

401
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Time?

402
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,000
If you have time for plants, it's a leaf of Gekkeiju.

403
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
You can look it up.

404
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:20,000
In the sense of a leaf of Gekkeiju, there is a meaning of winning the marathon.

405
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Basically.

406
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Basically what?

407
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
There's a lot of, what do you call it?

408
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Present.

409
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:33,000
And then...

410
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Butter.

411
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
What are you doing?

412
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,000
So, on the leaf of Gekkeiju.

413
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
What?

414
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Let's do our best to cover the leaf of Gekkeiju in the marathon.

415
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
That's right.

416
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Everyone who does the marathon thinks so and runs.

417
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
That kind of...

418
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Anji is coming.

419
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Anji is coming.

420
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
The old general has arrived.

421
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
That's what he said.

422
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
What kind of person is this old general?

423
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
What kind of person?

424
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Yes, I hear that a lot.

425
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:15,000
That's what they say periodically before the winter comes.

426
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
It's called the coming of the winter general.

427
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:23,000
So, from now on, it's going to be that, isn't it?

428
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
It's going to be cold.

429
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
It's going to be cold.

430
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
What kind of person is this winter general?

431
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,000
What?

432
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,000
What kind of outfit is this?

433
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
The winter general is not a human being.

434
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
That's stupid.

435
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
It's called the coming of the winter general.

436
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
It's called the coming of the winter general.

437
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
It's called the coming of the winter general.

438
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:55,000
That's why I'm alive.

439
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,000
I don't know if it's a role, but I'll do my best.

440
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:05,000
It's not a human being.

441
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Is this a human being?

442
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
It's called the coming of the winter general.

443
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
That's right.

444
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Let's write that the coming of the winter general is coming.

445
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
That's right.

446
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
It's a human being.

447
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
It's not a human being.

448
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
It's a human being, the winter general.

449
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
The winter general is amazing.

450
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
What kind of clothes are you wearing?

451
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,000
The winter general is a design perma.

452
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,000
It's clear.

453
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,000
If you don't have a clear head like this, I can't touch it.

454
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
I understand.

455
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
What kind of clothes are you wearing?

456
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,000
It's a side split.

457
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Is it a side split?

458
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
It's a side split.

459
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
If you split it too much, you'll be told to take it off from there.

460
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Sometimes from here.

461
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
I'm thinking.

462
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
I'm thinking.

463
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
The winter general.

464
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
What kind of clothes are you wearing?

465
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
The winter general.

466
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Mostly.

467
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
T-shirt.

468
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Mostly T-shirt.

469
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
The winter general is wearing a T-shirt.

470
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
What kind of T-shirt are you wearing?

471
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
It's a movie of skulls.

472
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
It's a movie of skulls.

473
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
What kind of underwear are you wearing?

474
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
What kind of underwear are you wearing?

475
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Vintage fashion.

476
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
The winter general is very tight.

477
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,000
It's a historical record.

478
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I'm going to do it this time because I know it.
