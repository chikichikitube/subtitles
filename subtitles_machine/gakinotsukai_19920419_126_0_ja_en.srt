1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Next time, at Gaki no Tsukai,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Live Broadcast!

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Next time, at Gaki no Tsukai,

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Chikishiki!

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Bonjiman Contest!

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Good evening!

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
This time,

8
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
We've invited various Bon people

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
to decide the number one Bon.

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Let's introduce the judges.

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
First, Yoshida Hiro!

12
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Mayu Keppon!

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Good evening!

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Oh, it's already over?

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Boo!

16
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Interesting!

17
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The best!

18
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Here you go!

19
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Next, Yuko Inoue!

20
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Good evening!

21
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Thank you for coming!

22
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
You and I are here today because we're annoyed.

23
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
No, that's not it!

24
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Why are you so annoyed?

25
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
No, it's not that.

26
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I was looking forward to today.

27
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
This program has a good number of viewers.

28
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
That's why!

29
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I didn't know there was someone like you.

30
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
No, it's not that.

31
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
It's just that Hana-san said it herself.

32
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I often watch it.

33
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Oh, is that so?

34
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Yes!

35
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Can't you do it with a leotard?

36
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
What about the leotard?

37
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
What?

38
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Is it a leotard?

39
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
It's like this.

40
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
If you put one shot under it, it's okay.

41
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
No, that's not good at all.

42
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I haven't been out since I got my hair done.

43
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
The last person is this person!

44
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Mouth burn!

45
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Do you want me to bite you?

46
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Do you want me to bite you?

47
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Can't you do it now?

48
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
It's not good at all.

49
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Let's have the person in front come out.

50
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Yes, please.

51
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
What's with your teeth?

52
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
It's like a piano.

53
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
In between.

54
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
How much bone is it?

55
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Let's try it.

56
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Yes, a little behind.

57
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
How much?

58
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
First of all, how much bone is the lip?

59
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Yes.

60
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Look, if it's this much bone, it's that, right?

61
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Please try it, Mr. Hamada.

62
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
It's dirty.

63
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I'll make it smaller.

64
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
What are you doing?

65
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Yes, thank you very much.

66
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Next person.

67
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Yes, please.

68
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Ha! Bone!

69
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
It was shaking, wasn't it?

70
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I'm a little nervous.

71
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
It's Ha! Bone.

72
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I'm going to call the director.

73
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I'm the director, Saito.

74
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
This is our chief.

75
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Yes.

76
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
The chief is like this.

77
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
This is Ha! Bone.

78
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
This is Ha! Bone.

79
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
It's this big.

80
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
If it was normal, it would have been three meters tall.

81
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Isn't it amazing?

82
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
It's Ha! Bone.

83
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
The corn is already fast.

84
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Is that so?

85
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Please.

86
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I'm going to eat it.

87
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
You're eating it with your tongue.

88
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
You're eating it with your tongue.

89
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
You're eating it with your tongue.

90
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Let's make Saito do it.

91
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Yes.

92
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Start.

93
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Yours is faster.

94
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
What are you going to do if you win?

95
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Thank you very much.

96
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Yes, let's go.

97
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Next person, please.

98
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Eyebrows Bippon.

99
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Please say your eyebrows are Bippon.

100
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Please wait a moment.

101
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
The eyebrows are Bohn.

102
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Look at these eyebrows.

103
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Why are you wearing a ribbon?

104
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Wow!

105
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
What?

106
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Wow!

107
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Can I take this off?

108
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Sure.

109
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Wow!

110
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
It's really long.

111
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Wow! What is this?

112
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Don't say it with this.

113
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
It's amazing.

114
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Kiyoshi is also surprised, right?

115
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Should I do it like this?

116
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I know, I know.

117
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Is it hard to understand?

118
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I know, I know.

119
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
What are you doing?

120
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Don't hit me.

121
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
You're an amateur.

122
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
You're hitting me with a scissor.

123
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Thank you very much.

124
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
The last person, please.

125
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Meat Bohn.

126
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
The last person is Meat Bohn.

127
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
This woman is a pure regular.

128
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
If you look at this, I think you are more beautiful than me.

129
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
What?

130
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
But I have a taste.

131
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
It's not that you don't like it.

132
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
If you look at the side, it doesn't smell.

133
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Why?

134
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Why?

135
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Please prepare it.

136
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
What should I start with?

137
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
First of all,

138
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
everyone, please look at Meat Bohn.

139
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Switch on.

140
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Look.

141
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Like waves.

142
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
It's a fish.

143
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Are you good at fishing?

144
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Actually, Nagatomi is very good at it.

145
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Despite this body shape,

146
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
she is very good at it.

147
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
She is good at it.

148
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
She is so light.

149
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
It's like an SFX.

150
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Shall we start?

151
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Let's start.

152
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Bohn.

153
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I have changed my way of thinking.

154
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
What is it?

155
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I don't work too much.

156
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Is that so?

157
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
It's not like that.

158
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
How about this tax?

159
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
That's enough.

160
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
You are really persistent.

161
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I will say it.

162
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I will say it.

163
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Why did you say it twice?

164
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I will say it.

165
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
The current situation in Japan is very strange.

166
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Shut up.

167
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I can't sit next to you.

168
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I can't sit next to you.

169
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Let me tell you something.

170
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Every month,

171
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I get 10% of my salary from the company.

172
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
That's enough.

173
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
It's the current situation.

174
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
It's not enough.

175
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Give me some more.

176
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
The country is in a bad situation.

177
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
The country is in a bad situation.

178
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
It's not like 5,000 yen or 6,000 yen.

179
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
It's not like 5,000 yen or 6,000 yen.

180
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
It's enough.

181
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Do you know how much I have to pay next month?

182
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
30 million yen.

183
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I have to pay 30 million yen in taxes.

184
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
30 million yen?

185
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
30 million yen?

186
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Have you ever seen 30 million yen?

187
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I will tell you a detailed story.

188
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I have an office in downtown.

189
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I have to pay taxes in June.

190
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I have to pay taxes in my office.

191
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
50 million yen is not enough.

192
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
You and I have to pay 50 million yen.

193
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Why 50 million yen?

194
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
You are a fool.

195
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
You are a fool.

196
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
You and I have different positions.

197
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Think about it.

198
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I am the president of your office.

199
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
You are a fool.

200
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:32,000
You have a family that you don't understand.

201
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I don't have anything.

202
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I am a vegetarian.

203
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
You are a fool.

204
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
You are a fool.

205
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I don't listen to you.

206
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
You are a fool.

207
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I feel sorry for you.

208
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I don't want to talk about it.

209
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
If I go to the public toilet, there will be no paper.

210
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I don't care.

211
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I can't buy a toilet paper.

212
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
You are doing a good thing.

213
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
You are a fool.

214
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I will be a bad person.

215
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I have a lot of bad things.

216
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I have a lot of bad things.

217
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Remember it.

218
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I will be a bad person again.

219
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Are you a bad person now?

220
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Yes.

221
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
You are a fool.

222
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
You are a fool.

223
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
You are a fool.

224
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
You are a fool.

225
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I have a lot of bad things.

226
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I want you to use the tax well.

227
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
You can't use it for good things.

228
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I have a lot of money.

229
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I have a lot of bad things.

230
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I want you to use the tax well.

231
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
You are a fool.

232
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
You are a fool.

233
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I want you to use the tax well.

234
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I have a lot of bad things.

235
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I want you to use the tax well.

236
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I have a lot of bad things.

237
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I want you to use the tax well.

238
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I have a lot of bad things.

239
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I have a lot of bad things.

240
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
You are a fool.

241
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
You are a fool.

242
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
You are a fool.

243
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
You are a fool.

244
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I have never used the tax well.

245
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Did you ride a swing recently?

246
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Do you use the public toilet?

247
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I rarely use the public toilet.

248
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
You don't use it.

249
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
You don't want to use it.

250
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I have a lot of bad things.

251
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
You don't want to use it.

252
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I have a lot of bad things.

253
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Do you use the public toilet?

254
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I have a lot of bad things.

255
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Do you use the public toilet?

256
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I have a lot of bad things.

257
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
You look like a prima donna.

258
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
The one who stands up with their feet.

259
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Oh my.

260
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
You are right.

261
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
You are wrong.

262
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
You want to escape?

263
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Where do you want to escape?

264
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
You want to escape?

265
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
We'll hold hands with each other.

266
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Don't you want to run away to the end of the sunset?

267
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Where is it?

268
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
If I can run away, I want to run away.

269
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
That kind of thing...

270
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
That kind of thing...

271
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I'll get rid of it, you know.

272
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Well, yes.

273
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
The good thing is, after all, the bad thing.

274
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
That's why...

275
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I'm talking like this, right?

276
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I don't know if it's a comedy or something,

277
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
but I'm going to say it's a bad thing.

278
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
And this talk is...

279
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
It's in place of the sutra.

280
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
It's in place of the sutra.

281
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
A young person like that talks about a stupid thing.

282
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
If it were me, I would have bought all the products.

283
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
In the morning.

284
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Now I don't even need a stylist.

285
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I'm going to go anywhere with you.

286
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
In the morning.

287
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Oh, it's late.

288
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
What's that?

289
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
It's so cute.

290
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I heard you came to play.

291
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I'm not lying.

292
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I came to the opening.

293
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Well, but...

294
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Thank you for staying.

295
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
No, no, no.

296
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
It's nothing.

297
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I came out in a swimsuit today.

298
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
That's right.

299
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I didn't bring it today.

300
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
What?

301
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
What?

302
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Why did you come out in English underwear?

303
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Because the underwear is not cool.

304
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
No, it's big.

305
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
What kind of underwear are you wearing?

306
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
You're wearing underwear that's up to your nipples.

307
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
It's very normal, but the cut is not so strong.

308
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Is that so?

309
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Yes.

310
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
What about the one with the string?

311
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
The string is...

312
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Too much?

313
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
It's hard to wear.

314
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Oh.

315
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
It's hard.

316
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
That's right.

317
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,000
If you untie the string while it's growing, it's hard to tie it.

318
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:25,000
If you tie it and wear it, the string becomes loose.

319
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Is that so?

320
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Why are you...

321
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Is that so?

322
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Are you really wearing it right now?

323
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Is that so?

324
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Thank you very much.

325
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Thank you very much.

326
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
There is something I always find strange.

327
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
There is a golf club that old people often talk about.

328
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Why is that limited to golf?

329
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I think it's a pro-wrestling club where naked people sweat.

330
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I think it's okay to have a bungee jumping club.

331
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
What do you think?

332
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
No, no, no.

333
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
But why is it only golf?

334
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Well, generally, golf is...

335
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I don't know about that, but while playing golf...

336
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
What?

337
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Do you say something?

338
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
While doing something, you get caught up in it.

339
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I walk until I go to the next stop.

340
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
At that time...

341
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Hey, Mr. Nantoka.

342
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Please take care of me.

343
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Don't you walk around saying that?

344
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
It's no good not to take care of you.

345
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
What kind of conversation do you have while bungee jumping?

346
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Why?

347
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Didn't you hear what the other person said?

348
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
He was screaming.

349
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
That's no good.

350
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
It's not a conversation.

351
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Covering.

352
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Covering is hard.

353
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
That's why.

354
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
It's a real conversation.

355
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
So it's no good not to take care of you.

356
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Is that so?

357
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Yes.

358
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
So it's no good not to hurt the other person.

359
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
It's no good.

360
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
But it's no good not to take care of you.

361
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I wonder if you can play golf.

362
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Even if you miss a shot like the other day,

363
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
you say, nice shot!

364
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
And maybe the guy in the lower part

365
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
will come slowly,

366
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
so he'll go ahead,

367
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
kick the ball,

368
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
and do it in front of you.

369
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
He'll say, I'm jumping this far!

370
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I wonder if that's the case.

371
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I don't like that kind of world.

372
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I really don't like it.

373
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
The other day, in the newspaper,

374
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:50,000
there was an article saying,

375
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
when I do this and that,

376
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
it's like a giant has won.

377
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
What?

378
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
When?

379
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I...

380
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I always...

381
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I go out of the house.

382
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I say something and go out.

383
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
So when I do this and that,

384
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I don't say that.

385
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
You did!

386
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
You said it twice!

387
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I didn't say a word.

388
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
No, you said it twice!

389
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I didn't say it.

390
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
You did!

391
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
You said it twice!

392
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I didn't say a word.

393
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
No, you said it twice!

394
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
What?

395
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
What was that?

396
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
So,

397
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
even if it rains,

398
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
he said,

399
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
tomorrow,

400
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
even if it rains,

401
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
even if it rains,

402
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I'll definitely go out.

403
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Even if the giant wins,

404
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I'll go out!

405
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
That's what he said.

406
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Even if the giant wins,

407
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I'll go out.

408
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Even if the giant wins,

409
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I'll go out.

410
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
That's what he said.

411
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Even if the giant wins,

412
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I'll go out.

413
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Ma-san said,

414
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
even if the giant wins,

415
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
he'll go out,

416
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
so he went out to buy bread, didn't he?

417
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
But he said,

418
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
even if the giant wins,

419
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I'll go out.

420
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
That's not true!

421
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Why?

422
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Even if the giant wins,

423
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I'll go out.

424
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
So, he said, even if the giant wins,

425
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I'll go out.

426
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Even if the giant wins,

427
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I'll go out.

428
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
That's not true!

429
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
He said that!

430
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
He said that!

431
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
He said that!

432
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
He said that!

433
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
He said that!

434
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Why do you always say that

435
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
when I'm thinking?

436
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
You should say it more often.

437
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
You should say that.

438
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I've never seen you like this.

439
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Don't lie!

440
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I'm thinking about it,

441
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
but it's too late.

442
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Even if the giant wins,

443
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I'll go out.

444
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
So, even if the giant wins,

445
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I'll go out.

446
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I said, even if the giant wins,

447
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I'll go out.

448
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
You idiot!

449
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
What are you talking about?

450
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
There's no twist or lie!

451
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Why don't you twist it?

452
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Then, say it straight from the beginning!

453
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I'm kidding.

454
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I'll say it properly from now on.

455
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I'm not going to twist it.

456
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I'll just talk.

457
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Please!

458
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
This giant is not a baseball giant.

459
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
What?

460
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
What?

461
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
It's a giant...

462
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
What do you call it?

463
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
This is about my father, right?

464
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
It means that the number of times my father won is different.

465
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
It's painful.

466
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
It's painful.

467
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:39,000
It's different, isn't it?

468
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I got it.

469
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I finally got it.

470
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
That was a lie, wasn't it?

471
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
This giant is not about baseball.

472
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
That's what I just heard.

473
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
The giant won.

474
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I'll go home right away.

475
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
This is...

476
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Is it okay?

477
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Wait a minute.

478
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I got it from your intonation just now.

479
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Masao went to the toy store.

480
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
To the toy store.

481
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
To the toy store.

482
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
That's funny.

483
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
He went to the toy store.

484
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
There's a toy store like this.

485
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Why are you angry?

486
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
There's a toy store like this.

487
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
What are you angry about?

488
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I don't know.

489
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Is Masao like that?

490
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Is Masao like that?

491
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
It's a proper toy.

492
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Is Masao like that?

493
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Eight thousand and five hundred yen.

494
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
He sold it for eight thousand and five hundred yen.

495
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
The giant.

496
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
It's cheap.

497
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
It's expensive.

498
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Masao said.

499
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
What are you talking about?

500
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Was Masao in elementary school?

501
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
To my mother.

502
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
To my mother.

503
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
What are you talking about to your mother?

504
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I'm so excited.

505
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
It's a grammar mess.

506
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
He went out.

507
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Masao in elementary school.

508
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
He went out.

509
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Father.

510
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I thought Masao was me.

511
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
He's calm.

512
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
He's calm even though he's my son.

513
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Let's buy it for him.

514
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Come on.

515
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Go to the toy store.

516
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Go to the toy store.

517
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Go to the toy store.

518
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Masao.

519
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Masao.

520
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Go home.

521
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
He said.

522
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
That giant.

523
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
That's right.

524
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
I understand now.

525
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
What if you suddenly become a bird?

526
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
For example, if Machan becomes a bird.

527
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
How do you make Hamachan understand that you are Machan?

528
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Even if Hamachan understands it.

529
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I'm confident that I can do it with a bird and Hama-chan.

530
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
How about this?

531
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
What if you become a bird?

532
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Even if you become a bird.

533
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
But you know me somehow.

534
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I don't know.

535
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I know you.

536
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
What's the name of this hall?

537
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
This is Minami Otsuka Hall.

538
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Minami Otsuka Hall.

539
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
5 o'clock.

540
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
If it's 5 o'clock, I'll be there.

541
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,000
It's close.

542
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
What?

543
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I'm telling you.

544
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
We don't know that.

545
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
You might be telling me.

546
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
I'm talking to Sugachan at 5 o'clock.

547
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
What?

548
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
I'm talking to Sugachan at 5 o'clock.

549
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
I don't know if you're talking or not.

550
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
If you say that, I can understand it.

551
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
So I'll be there.

552
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I can understand it in that state.

553
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
No one knows that you're a bird.

554
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
It's 5 o'clock.

555
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
It's already 4 o'clock.

556
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
But I can't see you.

557
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
I'm sleeping.

558
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
I can't go out.

559
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
No one will come out.

560
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
No one will come out.

561
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Really?

562
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Then, what's going on outside?

563
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
When I thought about it,

564
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
There's a Zabuton over there.

565
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
You're turning around.

566
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I'm turning around.

567
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Piyo?

568
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I'm saying Piyo.

569
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
This is what a bird is like.

570
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Really?

571
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
This is what a bird is like.

572
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
This is what a bird is like.

573
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
This is what a bird is like.

574
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
That's right.

575
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
It's sitting on a Zabuton.

576
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
At that time,

577
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Don't you think this is not Matsumoto?

578
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
At that point?

579
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Yes.

580
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I don't think so at that point.

581
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Well, at that point,

582
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
After all, I can't see Matsumoto.

583
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
You can't see it.

584
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
But the audience is already here.

585
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Yes.

586
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
I can't help it.

587
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
I can't help it.

588
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I'm sorry, but can I be alone today?

589
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I can't help it.

590
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Ladies and gentlemen.

591
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Come on.

592
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
It's coming out.

593
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I'm here.

594
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I'm here, too.

595
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
I can't see it.

596
00:21:49,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I can't see it again.
