00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Let's meet in the 4th episode of the 100-yen goods challenge, Kekeke no Youkai Gundan!

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:20,000
This time, we're going to become Youkai characters using 100-yen goods.

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
In the past, it was Showa no Star and Star Wars.

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
It was a huge success.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
It was a huge success.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
It was a huge success.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
It wasn't a failure.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
It was a huge success.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
1000 yen budget, 100-yen goods challenge.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
This time, this character is the theme from the popular Youkai you all know.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Please enjoy while comparing the real thing with your smartphone.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
First of all, let's take a look at each of the characters.

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Ready?

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Ready?

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
The main character.

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
As expected.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
As expected.

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The main character.

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Amazing.

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Amazing.

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I see.

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
200 yen.

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
200 yen.

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
200 yen.

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
200 yen.

26
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
800 yen.

27
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
800 yen.

28
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
800 yen.

29
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Each Youkai character is decided here.

30
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
KITARO, 1000 yen is not enough.

31
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
KITARO, 1000 yen is not enough.

32
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
1000 yen is not enough.

33
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Please.

34
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The mouse sound is also surprisingly easy.

35
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
This is the most difficult.

36
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
This is very difficult.

37
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
This is very difficult.

38
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
This is very difficult.

39
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
How do you express this?

40
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I will definitely give you 100 yen.

41
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Why is that?

42
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Because you are naked.

43
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Because you are naked.

44
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
DOM ROCK will also be happy.

45
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
You cheated on me.

46
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I'm sorry.

47
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
They went to the 100 yen shop.

48
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
They went back to the studio and finished their production.

49
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Finally, the Youkai battle in the studio set will be shown.

50
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
This is an image.

51
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
This is in my head.

52
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Do you have any particular points?

53
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Basically, I'm barefoot.

54
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I'm naked.

55
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I will make this with felt.

56
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
This is perfect.

57
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
This is OK.

58
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
This is fast.

59
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I will definitely use this.

60
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I see.

61
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
This may be good.

62
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I will do this.

63
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I will do this.

64
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I will make two of these.

65
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
This is perfect.

66
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I will decorate this later.

67
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I want a head.

68
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I want a head.

69
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I want a head.

70
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
This is strange.

71
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I want a small head.

72
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I want this.

73
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I want this.

74
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I want this.

75
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Do you have an image?

76
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I don't have an image.

77
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Do you have hair?

78
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I have no hair.

79
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I have no choice but to shave this.

80
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Everyone said that this can be made with 200 yen.

81
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Everyone said that this can be made with 200 yen.

82
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I have never seen a 100-yen shop that sells only white cloth.

83
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
This is a envelope.

84
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
This is a envelope.

85
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
ITAMONOEN has a unique corner.

86
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
This is not sold.

87
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
If I put a corner on this, it will be over.

88
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
This is solid.

89
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
This is good.

90
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
This is good for creating a corner.

91
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Wait a minute.

92
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
This is a rice bag.

93
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Is this a purchase item?

94
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
This is an ideal corner.

95
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
This is perfect.

96
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
How much is this?

97
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
This is 5 yen for this.

98
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
This is sold, so this is good.

99
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
This is a non-woven sheet.

100
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
This is a non-woven sheet for gardening.

101
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
This is 1.35 x 2 meters.

102
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
This can be made with 5 yen.

103
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
This can be made with 200 yen.

104
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
This can be made with 200 yen.

105
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Do you have an image?

106
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I don't have an image.

107
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I only need this.

108
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I don't need this.

109
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
This is 70 liters.

110
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
This is a rice bag.

111
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
This is an eye ball.

112
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I don't know if it's okay to call it an eye ball.

113
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I think the wire is better.

114
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
This is not good.

115
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I think a ball is better.

116
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
This is not good.

117
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
This is good.

118
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
This is the most difficult.

119
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
There are many things to buy.

120
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I definitely need this.

121
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I wear clothes inside.

122
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I have a beard.

123
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I have hair.

124
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I don't know if I can do this with a garbage bag.

125
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
What color is this?

126
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
This is black.

127
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I see.

128
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Is it okay to have a black garbage bag?

129
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I don't think this is dirty.

130
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I will cut this.

131
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
This is 300 yen.

132
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I don't think this is dirty.

133
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I don't think this is dirty.

134
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
This is my beard.

135
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I will paint this black.

136
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
For example.

137
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
This is a hair tie.

138
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
This is good.

139
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I don't need to cut this.

140
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I don't need this.

141
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
How many do you need?

142
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I need three.

143
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I need three.

144
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I need three.

145
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Really?

146
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
What kind of shirt is this?

147
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
This is blue.

148
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
This is like this.

149
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
This is blue.

150
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I don't need this.

151
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I don't need this.

152
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I don't need this.

153
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I don't need this.

154
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I don't need this.

155
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I don't need this.

156
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I have a beard.

157
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
What kind of face is this?

158
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
This is different.

159
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I can draw a face from above.

160
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
This is different.

161
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
What is this?

162
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
This is a cloth that can be pasted.

163
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
This is convenient.

164
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
This is a cloth that can be pasted.

165
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
This is this.

166
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
This is difficult to throw away.

167
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
This is this.

168
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
This is too cute.

169
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
This is this.

170
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
This is this.

171
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I think hair is important.

172
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
What is this?

173
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,000
This is a little doping.

174
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
This is a little doping.

175
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
This is a little doping.

176
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:16,000
This is a very good head.

177
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
This is very good.

178
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
This is a very good head.

179
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
This is like this.

180
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
This is a good head.

181
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
This is a stainless ball.

182
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,000
This is a good head.

183
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
This is a good head.

184
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I put sand in this.

185
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I think cat eyes are important.

186
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I think cat eyes are important.

187
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I think cat eyes are important.

188
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I put this in.

189
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I think this can be used for cat eyes.

190
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I cut this.

191
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
What is this?

192
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
This is a light.

193
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
This is a little doping.

194
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
This is 200 yen.

195
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
This is not 100 yen.

196
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
This is like this.

197
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
This is like this.

198
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
This is a little different.

199
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
This is this.

200
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
He checks other items that can be used for red clothes.

201
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
This is 200 yen.

202
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
This is 200 yen.

203
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,000
This is a black gum.

204
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I want to hang this up.

205
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I want to make cat eyes.

206
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I put this in.

207
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I put this in.

208
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I'm curious about the other products.

209
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I think KITARO is a mouse man.

210
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I think the mouse man is too strong.

211
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I think the mouse man is too strong.

212
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I hate the mouse man.

213
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I hate the mouse man.

214
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I cut this.

215
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I think this can be used for cat eyes.

216
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I think this can be used for cat eyes.

217
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I think this can be used for cat eyes.

218
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:47,000
MATSUMOTO eats a lot of mouse products.

219
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
This is too shiny.

220
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
This is quite expensive.

221
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:04,000
This is 100 yen.

222
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,000
This is small.

223
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
What is this?

224
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:17,000
This is more sticky than I thought.

225
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
This is more sticky than I thought.

226
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
This is a mouse.

227
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I think this can be used for cat eyes.

228
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I think this can be used for cat eyes.

229
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I think this can be used for cat eyes.

230
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I don't need this much.

231
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I don't need this much.

232
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:58,000
This is a character production.

233
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,000
This is a character production.

234
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I want to use this.

235
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I want to use this.

236
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
This is easy.

237
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
This is enough.

238
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
MATSUMOTO is making a bunch of straws.

239
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:49,000
The color of the hair is different depending on the tree.

240
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
This is a purple kimono.

241
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
This is a white kimono.

242
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
What happened?

243
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:02,000
This is shorter than I thought.

244
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
What is this?

245
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
This is a obi.

246
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,000
HAMADA starts making CHANCHANKO.

247
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
This is a horizontal bar.

248
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
This is different in length.

249
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
This is shorter.

250
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
How can I cut this?

251
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I can't cut this.

252
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:38,000
He arranges the items he bought at a 100-yen shop.

253
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
It's difficult to make a sphere.

254
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
It's difficult to make a sphere.

255
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
He cuts the hair with scissors.

256
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
He makes a beard.

257
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Please give me a long beard.

258
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Why is this a safety pin?

259
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Why is this a safety pin?

260
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
This is a safety pin.

261
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
This is a very good thing.

262
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I'm relieved.

263
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:14,000
This is a very good thing.

264
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Can I fix this?

265
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:29,000
If I fix this now, it will be like this.

266
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:34,000
If I fix this now, it will be like this.

267
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
What should I do?

268
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
He starts working for 30 minutes.

269
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:52,000
This is a lot of work.

270
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
This is a lot of work.

271
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
This is a lot of work.

272
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
After this, Ichido and KONAKU gather.

273
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
How did they get together?

274
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Ichido, who made a yokai character using 100-yen goods, has gathered in the studio.

275
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Ichido, who made a yokai character using 100-yen goods, has gathered in the studio.

276
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
What will happen?

277
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Murarihyon, the leader of the yokai, has a plan to defeat Kitaro.

278
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Where is the mouse man?

279
00:15:51,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Murarihyon, the leader of the yokai, has a plan to defeat Kitaro.

280
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
His body is made of suit covers.

281
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
His face is made of a computer case.

282
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
His beard is made of a bandage.

283
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
His face is made of a bandage.

284
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Will Kitaro really come here?

285
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Of course.

286
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I'm looking forward to it.

287
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I will stop him today.

288
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
What is this?

289
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:46,000
This is a hairstyle reproduced with a garbage bag and a raincoat.

290
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,000
This is a hairstyle reproduced with a garbage bag and a raincoat.

291
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
You are Murarihyon.

292
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
You deceived me.

293
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Sorry.

294
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
You deceived me.

295
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
This is your last day.

296
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Take this.

297
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Damn it.

298
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Take this.

299
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I got a remote control.

300
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
What?

301
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I want to see everything in your hands.

302
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Damn it.

303
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Wait a minute.

304
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Wait a minute.

305
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
You are Murarihyon.

306
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:59,000
This is a hairstyle reproduced with a bandage and a raincoat.

307
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:04,000
This is a hairstyle reproduced with a bandage and a raincoat.

308
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
You deceived me again.

309
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Take this.

310
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Sorry.

311
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Wow.

312
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Wow.

313
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Damn it.

314
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
This is the only way.

315
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Are you running away?

316
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Kitaro.

317
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Defeat them quickly.

318
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,000
The lower half of the body is protected with duct tape.

319
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:49,000
The eyes of the eyeball are finished with red and black felt.

320
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I brought my father.

321
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Dad.

322
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Damn it.

323
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I can't do this.

324
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
What should I do?

325
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Damn it.

326
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
You deceived me again.

327
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,000
This is a girl's style with vivid red.

328
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
The nails are made of duct tape.

329
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,000
The eyes of the cat are made of soap.

330
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Take this.

331
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Damn it.

332
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Kitaro.

333
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
This is your chance.

334
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Take this.

335
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Youkai Chan Chan Ko.

336
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Dad.

337
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Are you okay?

338
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Are you okay?

339
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Get ready.

340
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Mom.

341
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Mom.

342
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Mom.

343
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Mom.

344
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Mom.

345
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Mom.

346
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Mom.

347
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Mom.

348
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Mom.

349
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Mom.

350
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Mom.

351
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Mom.

352
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,000
The eight parts of the head that he was most particular about.

353
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:27,120
It's a big problem that he boldly put two

354
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:33,000
balls on it.

355
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Mom.

356
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Mom.

357
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Hey.

358
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Why?

359
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Why is this guy on it?

360
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
No, it's getting heavier and heavier.

361
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
It's going back to the back of the head.

362
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
It's all gone.

363
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
It's going to be crushed by a friend.

364
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
I can't move it because it's heavy.

365
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Eight points.

366
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
It's my turn.

367
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
It's a good place.

368
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
I'm going to kill them with my magic.

369
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
I know that.

370
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
He uses a non-eating sheet for entertainment.

371
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:21,000
The hand that uses the fork, the eye of the tape, and even the details are particular about it.

372
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Ah, it's painful!

373
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
What? What's wrong with me?

374
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Looks like you've regained your sanity.

375
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,000
I'm glad. Now all that's left is to punish him.

376
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Hey, mouse man!

377
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Where are you going?

378
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Wait!

379
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Mouse man!

380
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Mouse man!

381
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:13,000
My mother used a straw and put it in here so I wouldn't lose it.

382
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
What's wrong with you?

383
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
This is 700 yen.

384
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
You have 300 yen left?

385
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
I have 300 yen left.

386
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
And I have a lot of straws left.

387
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
I have a lot of this, too.

388
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
What's this?

389
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
This is something to stop.

390
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Oh, but it's good.

391
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Is this a computer case?

392
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
What's a computer? Well, something like that.

393
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
This is a straw.

394
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
I put it in here so I wouldn't lose it.

395
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
It's convenient.

396
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
It's convenient.

397
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Can you see it?

398
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
It's good, isn't it?

399
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
What is it?

400
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
What?

401
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
I have a cold.

402
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
I have a cold.

403
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
I have a cold.

404
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
You have a cold.

405
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
You have a cold.

406
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
I have a cold.

407
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Are you okay?

408
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
A mouse man.

409
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
It's hard to see the food.

410
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
It's dirty, isn't it?

411
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
It's dirty, isn't it?

412
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
It's dirty, isn't it?

413
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
It's dirty, isn't it?

414
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
It's dirty, isn't it?

415
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Shut up!

416
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
The mouse man is a little dirty.

417
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:37,000
It was a play, but it wasn't very good.

418
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
It wasn't good at all.

419
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
You were the worst.

420
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
It was very bad.

421
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
The tempo was also very good.

422
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
No, no, no.

423
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
I haven't changed my name at all.

424
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Are you okay?

425
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Are you okay?

426
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
I can't do it anymore.

427
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
I can't do it anymore.

428
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:09,000
I can't do it anymore.
