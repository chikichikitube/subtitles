1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,600
In the first episode of Gaki no Tsukai, Chiki-chiki!

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:06,000
O-Mise-Taiko Spring Selection Sports Day!

3
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:11,600
Today, Wato-san...

4
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:12,100
Yes, yes.

5
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:14,600
There's a smelly shop here.

6
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,000
Today is the O-Mise-Taiko Sports Day.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Ah, that's right.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
This is...

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Pan-ya-san team!

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The old man has been taking pictures of us for a while now.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
There's a lot of money in here.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
It's gold.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
The popular Pan-ya-san team, San-Eto-R.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
They've been working hard on their own business for 68 years.

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Their son, Toshiyuki-san, has also grown a lot.

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Their first grandchild, Elisa-chan, also wants to join them in today's battle.

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
What's that?

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
The Pan-ya-san team.

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
The Pan-Eto-R team.

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
And now, the Saka-ya-san team is...

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Yamagata-ya-san!

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Is that your son?

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
It's my son.

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
His parents are here.

25
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Ah, that's right.

26
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Your father is also hiding his wealth.

27
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Ah, that's right.

28
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
But if my father was here, he'd be in trouble.

29
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The opponent, Omukai-san, is Yamagata-ya-san from Saka-ya.

30
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
His son, Masayuki-san, has passed on his father's legacy.

31
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
He will protect the 42-year history of the business.

32
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Last year, he finished renovating the store.

33
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
He's also going to have a family meeting with his new partner, Datou-Paya-san.

34
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
So, Masayuki-san.

35
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Yes, the first round is...

36
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Tama-Ire-Gas-Sen-Me!

37
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
The four teams are...

38
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Everyone, do your best.

39
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Tama-Ire is a noble game.

40
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Do your best.

41
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Let's go for one minute each.

42
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Yes.

43
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
The first round, get ready!

44
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Go!

45
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Okay!

46
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I'm lonely.

47
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Then, Nasai!

48
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Tama-Ire-Gas-Sen-Me!

49
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Tama-Ire-Gas-Sen-Me! Do your best!

50
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Tama-Ire-Gas-Sen-Me! Do your best!

51
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Yamagata-ya, you're a bit late!

52
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Tama-Ire-Gas-Sen-Me! Do your best!

53
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Yamagata-ya, you're a bit late!

54
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Yamagata-ya, do your best!

55
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Is your father a bit far away?

56
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Okay, okay.

57
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
They're all in.

58
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:31,000
35, 36, 32, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47...

59
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
49 to 44!

60
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
This game is...

61
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Tama-Ire-Gas-Sen-Me!

62
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
The second round, get ready!

63
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
This is a second round!

64
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Okay, let's go!

65
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
This is a second round!

66
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
The second round is...

67
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
the series mode!

68
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Okay!

69
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
The series mode!

70
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
The series mode!

71
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Let's introduce the runners.

72
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Who are they?

73
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
First, the Veya-san team is...

74
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Yome-san!

75
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Hiroko-san!

76
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Hiroko-san!

77
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Are you attracted to the bakery?

78
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
The baker came with me.

79
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Really?

80
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Well, this is quite the opposite.

81
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Yamamata-san's team is Oga-san!

82
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
This is a match between a wife and a husband, right?

83
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Yes, it's a match between a wife and a husband.

84
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
We're quite far apart though.

85
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
We're quite far apart though.

86
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
It's like the husband is making the wife feel weak.

87
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
This is also a three-round match.

88
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Even so, if it doesn't work, we'll do a T-back-janken.

89
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I'll be wearing this today.

90
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Let's go!

91
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I think I learned this somewhere.

92
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Where did you learn it?

93
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Let's go!

94
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
What do you think about this?

95
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I feel like this one fell earlier.

96
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Let's watch the previous one again.

97
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Let's replay it.

98
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Please watch.

99
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
That means Oga-san wins.

100
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Oga-san wins!

101
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Yamamata-san.

102
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Yes?

103
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
At the end, we'll do a kiba-sensei.

104
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Really?

105
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I can't believe you're doing such a fun thing.

106
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
No, it's not fun at all.

107
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
What are you talking about?

108
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
It's a 21st century joke.

109
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
It's too bad.

110
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Now, face each other!

111
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Whether you cry or laugh, it's decided.

112
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
There's no one who will cry.

113
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Now, let's go!

114
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
The final match, get ready!

115
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
It's not broken yet!

116
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
It's not broken yet!

117
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
It's not broken yet!

118
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
It's not broken yet!

119
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Are your glasses okay?

120
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Is it broken?

121
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
This match is Yamamata-san's victory!

122
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:18,000
The winner of the first two rounds is Yamamata-san! Congratulations!

123
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:28,000
The winner of the second round is Yamamata-san! Congratulations!

124
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
It's wonderful.

125
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
No, no, no, thank you.

126
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
It doesn't smell at all.

127
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
It doesn't smell at all.

128
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
No, no, no, thank you, thank you.

129
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Your face is red!

130
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
No, no, no.

131
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
It doesn't smell at all.

132
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
You don't look sporty at all.

133
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
No, no, I don't know what to say.

134
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
No, no, it's not like that.

135
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Well, I went to New York the other day.

136
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
You're lying!

137
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
You didn't go!

138
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
In the end, you went to New York, didn't you?

139
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
You said you went.

140
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
You said you went.

141
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I've never talked to you about New York.

142
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Oh, I see.

143
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
So that's why you fought.

144
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
That's right.

145
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Are you going to throw it again?

146
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
So how was New York?

147
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Well, I went to New York to look for Nozawa.

148
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Nozawa-kun is getting married.

149
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I went to see him.

150
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Nozawa is in a band called Chimpanzees.

151
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
What are you doing?

152
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I told you not to say it!

153
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I told Inoue-chan.

154
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
It's called Chimpanzees.

155
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
The eyebrows are connected.

156
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
You said you wanted to study comedy in New York, didn't you?

157
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Yes.

158
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Then you're a level down.

159
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
You're a mere coach.

160
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
You're dancing in a park somewhere.

161
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
You're dressed like a monkey.

162
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
There's a live performance of Chimpanzees.

163
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I finally found Nozawa.

164
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
When I arrived at the live performance,

165
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I saw him with pink hair and drinking coffee.

166
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
He looked like this.

167
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
It was a little strange.

168
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I said,

169
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
That's Nozawa's husband.

170
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Nozawa's husband's head is pink.

171
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
His head is pink.

172
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
It's dirty.

173
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
He's wearing shorts.

174
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
It's dirty.

175
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
It's dirty, isn't it?

176
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
It's fine.

177
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
It's not like that.

178
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I watched the live performance.

179
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Everyone was in the back of the hotel.

180
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
We were talking in the back of the night view.

181
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
My husband is coming today.

182
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I called him.

183
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
It's called Bob.

184
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
It's Bob.

185
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
It's a tough name.

186
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Bob came in and sat next to Nozawa.

187
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I was surprised.

188
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I looked at Bob.

189
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
What?

190
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Bob...

191
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
He's really like that.

192
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Everyone knows it, but they can't say it.

193
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
He knows it.

194
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
He doesn't think about anything.

195
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I said,

196
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Is that so?

197
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I have no choice but to say it.

198
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I don't know Bob.

199
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
He's laughing.

200
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I don't know Bob.

201
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
When we were talking,

202
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
He was flying.

203
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
He's a good guy.

204
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
In America,

205
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
There are many people who are flying.

206
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
In that sense,

207
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
He was flying.

208
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Bob was flying in many ways.

209
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
But he looked good in two shots.

210
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
That again?

211
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
That looks good again.

212
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I think that was a mistake.

213
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
During that time,

214
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Matsumoto went to Hakone's hot spring.

215
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
That was sudden.

216
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
It was definitely more fun here.

217
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
In the sense that you can do it slowly.

218
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Hakone is the best.

219
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I'm a little self-absorbed.

220
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Why?

221
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
It's really amazing.

222
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Why are you self-absorbed?

223
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Women are free to live.

224
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Women are blooming.

225
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
You do it.

226
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
When I went there,

227
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
There was a cable TV on the hotel's TV.

228
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Bang!

229
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Man.

230
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
This kind of man.

231
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Bang!

232
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Bang!

233
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:08,000
He took off his shirt.

234
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
His butt is sticking out.

235
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Bang!

236
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
As expected, 99 channels.

237
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
That's a big one.

238
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
What will happen to 100 channels?

239
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
That's a memory.

240
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Hakone is amazing.

241
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
It was amazing.

242
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
What was amazing?

243
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
When I went to the station, women were blooming.

244
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Bang!

245
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Who said that?

246
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Women.

247
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Why did you say that?

248
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Bang!

249
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Bang!

250
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Are you kidding me?

251
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I'm sorry.

252
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I was lying.

253
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Are you a pervert?

254
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Actually, there wasn't a single woman.

255
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
That's the worst.

256
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
There should be a woman I can call.

257
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:19,000
There was an old lady who prepared food.

258
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
There was no place for young people to play.

259
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
There wasn't.

260
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I thought I shouldn't do that.

261
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
There was a sculpture museum.

262
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
There wasn't.

263
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Of course there was.

264
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Of course there was.

265
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Of course there was.

266
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I said there wasn't.

267
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Really?

268
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Of course there was.

269
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
There wasn't.

270
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I searched.

271
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
There wasn't.

272
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Why did you lie?

273
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I still don't get it.

274
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
But the sculpture museum was quite interesting.

275
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
You don't know much about art, do you?

276
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
When I was a student, I got full marks in art.

277
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I don't care about that.

278
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Really?

279
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I don't care.

280
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
What are you talking about?

281
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I don't care.

282
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I don't care.

283
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
That's enough.

284
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I was always walking around.

285
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I was taken to Harlem.

286
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
It was scary.

287
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I couldn't see anything on the subway.

288
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I was told to get on.

289
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:32,000
But suddenly there were black people.

290
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
When I was filming,

291
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
people said,

292
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Hamada, what are you doing?

293
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Why can't you do that in Europe?

294
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I couldn't do it.

295
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Why?

296
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
It was scary.

297
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I went into the middle of the subway.

298
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I was in the sky above.

299
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
When I looked at my face,

300
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
my face was like this.

301
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I was told to sit down.

302
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
We were sitting together.

303
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
We were in a completely different place.

304
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
In front of me,

305
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
there was a child looking at me.

306
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
That was scary.

307
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
If I was in Japan,

308
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I would have been killed.

309
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
How old were you?

310
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I was in junior high school.

311
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I was in the sky above.

312
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I was scared.

313
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
The child was staring at me.

314
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I didn't want to see it.

315
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I was scared.

316
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Do kelp, seaweed, and seaweed soup come out of the sea?

317
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
No.

318
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Kelp doesn't come out of water.

319
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Why can't it come out of seawater?

320
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Because it's salt water.

321
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Oh.

322
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
You are quick to understand.

323
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
But it's strange.

324
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Why can't it come out of seawater?

325
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Why?

326
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Because when you make a pot,

327
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,000
you put salt in it, right?

328
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
The seawater comes out.

329
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
That's about a teaspoon.

330
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
It's different.

331
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Is that so?

332
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
That's right.

333
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
It doesn't come out.

334
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I think it comes out.

335
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I think it comes out.

336
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
That's how you took it.

337
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
It comes out.

338
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
It comes out, but you can't tell with salt water.

339
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Because it's amazing.

340
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
The sea has a bonito flavor.

341
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
It's kelp soup.

342
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
It's amazing.

343
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
It's all erased by seawater.

344
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
It's all erased by seawater.

345
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
It's too strong.

346
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
That's right.

347
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I see.

348
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
That's absolutely right.

349
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
What?

350
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
If you're convinced,

351
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
you're being made fun of.

352
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
No, no, no.

353
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
That's about it.

354
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I'll read it and make fun of it.

355
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I don't really make fun of it.

356
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
That's about it.

357
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
That's about it.

358
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
When you show a very large area,

359
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
you often say,

360
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
how many Tokyo domes are there?

361
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
It doesn't come to mind.

362
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I see.

363
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Please make a new unit.

364
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Oh, when you show a large area.

365
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
How many Tokyo domes?

366
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
You say that.

367
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
You say that.

368
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
But the size of the Tokyo dome

369
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
doesn't come to mind.

370
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I don't know.

371
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Even if you say 100 Tokyo domes,

372
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
you can see how large it is,

373
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
but you can't imagine

374
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
how large it is.

375
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
That's right.

376
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
For example,

377
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
if you say,

378
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
how many Mild Seven Lights are there?

379
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
It becomes a huge number,

380
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
so you don't know how many there are.

381
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
So you have to take a little more time.

382
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I see.

383
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Well,

384
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
how about Ota-kun?

385
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
It's better to do that.

386
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Wait a minute.

387
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Let's ask everyone about this.

388
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Ota-kun?

389
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Ota-kun, 50 people.

390
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
It's very easy to understand.

391
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Ota-kun, 50 people,

392
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,000
are laughing in my head.

393
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
You have to be Ota-kun.

394
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Why?

395
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Isn't that right?

396
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
You have to be Ota-kun.

397
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
You have to be Ota-kun.

398
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
You have to be Ota-kun.

399
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
You have to be Ota-kun.

400
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
When you say,

401
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Ota-kun, 50 people,

402
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
doesn't it come to mind?

403
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
It doesn't come to mind at all.

404
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
When you say Ota-kun,

405
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
it comes to mind.

406
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
It's a side-division.

407
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I don't know.

408
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
It doesn't matter.

409
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
You can't think of anything

410
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
with your name.

411
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
You can't think of anything with your name.

412
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Really?

413
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
When you say,

414
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Mr. Otagaki,

415
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
it's a bit...

416
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
It's ugly.

417
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
It's a bit ugly.

418
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
You don't have imagination.

419
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
If you laugh,

420
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
you can't imagine

421
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
to the point that you can't draw.

422
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I see.

423
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
That's no good.

424
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
You're very fast.

425
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
It's a side-division.

426
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
It's a side-division.

427
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
This is a side-division.

428
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Do you understand?

429
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Did you see it?

430
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
What kind of teacher is it?

431
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Mr. Sawada.

432
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:13,000
You have to be Ota-kun.

433
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
You have to be able to imagine.

434
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I see.

435
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
That's what it is.

436
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I have something I'm curious about.

437
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Please tell me about it.

438
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Is there really a Tokugawa Plastic Surgery?

439
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
When did you finally find it in the newspaper?

440
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Find?

441
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
That's the question.

442
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
It's written,

443
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
but you haven't seen it.

444
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Is there any other program

445
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
that can attract viewers?

446
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Mr. Raundan,

447
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
please tell me the truth of the incident.

448
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
This is that.

449
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I was doing it at Gimiya Break.

450
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I've been pulling it all the time

451
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
since I was a kid.

452
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
This is TBS.

453
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
TV-do.

454
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
TV-do.

455
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
What is TV-do?

456
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
It's a personal attack,

457
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
but you're attacking a big organization.

458
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Don't you stop it?

459
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
If you get hit by everyone, it hurts.

460
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
That's right.

461
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Itoi told me this story.

462
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
It's okay because it's an individual.

463
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Why does Itoi have a hole in his nose?

464
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Just because he's a normal kid.

465
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
It's because he's a professional.

466
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I have something to say.

467
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
What is it?

468
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I'm getting angry at the talent.

469
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
You're already the next one.

470
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,000
You said it first.

471
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I didn't say anything like that.

472
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I'm the most angry right now.

473
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I'm the most angry on TV these days.

474
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Don't underestimate me.

475
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Inoki.

476
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I'm angry.

477
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I don't even know the name.

478
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
How about the spiciness?

479
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
It's as spicy as oolong tea.

480
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I'm sorry for the tea, too.

481
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I'm sorry.

482
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
My face is really annoying.

483
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
My face is really annoying.

484
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I want to hit you.

485
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I don't think so.

486
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
It's really annoying.

487
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I want to see your face.

488
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
What's wrong with him?

489
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I want to see your face.

490
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:38,000
His commercials have a lot of dancing.

491
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
It's really annoying.

492
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I'm not that angry.

493
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I usually don't think about anything.

494
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
As long as it's a commercial.

495
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
His face when he dances is really annoying.

496
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,000
It's like he's being made fun of.

497
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
I didn't do it.

498
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I can't do it.

499
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
It's personal.

500
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
It's personal.

501
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:08,000
My face is really annoying.

502
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
There are people like that.

503
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Of course.

504
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Is that so?

505
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
His face when he says something is annoying.

506
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
What are you talking about?

507
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
His face when he says something is annoying.

508
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,000
I don't know if there's anyone who talks like that.

509
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Is that so?

510
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
I don't remember that tea commercial.

511
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
You don't remember?

512
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Seriously.

513
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I thought I had to say it when I was a kid.

514
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
I thought I had to say it when I was a kid.

515
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
I thought I had to say it when I was a kid.

516
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
I can't remember.

517
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Seriously.

518
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
The Michael Jackson commercial that was fun to watch on TV was fun.

519
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
The Michael Jackson commercial.

520
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
That was really fun.

521
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
His face is turning white.

522
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,000
The interviewer asked him a really stupid question.

523
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
He asked,

524
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Are you doing something with your skin?

525
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
It's a stupid talk.

526
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I should have asked that!

527
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
You're the one who should be asking.

528
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I was more excited to see it.

529
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Are you doing something with your skin?

530
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
He's a little angry.

531
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Then Michael said,

532
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:25,000
This is a disease.

533
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
That's what I heard.

534
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:37,000
You've done plastic surgery many times.

535
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
I haven't done it many times.

536
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I've done it many times because the media wrote it up on their own.

537
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I've done it only twice.

538
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
It's definitely a lie!

539
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
His face is completely different!

540
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
It's completely different.

541
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,000
There's a rumor that you're a virgin.

542
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
I asked, What do you think about this?

543
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Why are you talking like that?

544
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
I wanted you to hear it.

545
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Why do you want me to hear it?

546
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
There's a rumor like that.

547
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
I asked, What do you think about this?

548
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
It's private, so I don't want to say it.

549
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Don't say it like that.

550
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
You're a superstar, Michael!

551
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Please look at my garden.
