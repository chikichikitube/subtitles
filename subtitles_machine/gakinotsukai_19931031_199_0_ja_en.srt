1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
I'm not going to use my time. Don't look at the opening!

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Hettori Yamazaki vs. Taiman Gohan!

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
This isn't your first time, right?

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
It's not my first time.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
You've been doing this about four times?

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
That's right.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Ah, I see.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Until now, I've been doing it mentally.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
But this time, it's different.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
What?

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
What do you call it? A fight!

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
You're going to use your body?

13
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm going to use my body, so I might get injured.

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
You can really tell, right?

15
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I can really tell.

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Yamazaki-kun, go ahead!

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
That was a good one.

18
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
You're really going to use your body, right?

19
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Yes.

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Are you really strong?

21
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I understand.

22
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Does the pain go away?

23
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
It's because of your defense.

24
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
If you can defend yourself, the pain won't go away.

25
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I understand.

26
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Yamazaki-kun, go ahead!

27
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Who are you going to use your body for?

28
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Everyone has a flag, right?

29
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
The white one is Yamazaki-kun.

30
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
And the red one is your opponent.

31
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Then, let's get started.

32
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
The first one, go ahead!

33
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
This one is your opponent.

34
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Then, let's go!

35
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Ready!

36
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
It's not me!

37
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
It's you!

38
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
You're lying!

39
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
It's fun!

40
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
It's not me!

41
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
It's you!

42
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
It's you!

43
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
That was a good one!

44
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
That was a good one!

45
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Okay!

46
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I lost.

47
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
That was strong!

48
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
That was strong!

49
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
That was strong!

50
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
What's your name?

51
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Soeda Daichi.

52
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Daichi-kun?

53
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Yes.

54
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
How old are you?

55
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I'm 4 years old.

56
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
4 years old?

57
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
That was strong!

58
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Daichi-kun, are you doing something?

59
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Yes.

60
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
What are you doing?

61
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Boxing.

62
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I'm doing something with Ultraman.

63
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Everyone, go ahead!

64
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Thank you.

65
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Okay, let's go!

66
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
The second round, ready!

67
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Hey!

68
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Hey!

69
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Hey!

70
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Hey!

71
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Hey!

72
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Hey!

73
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Hey!

74
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Hey!

75
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Hey!

76
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Hey!

77
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Hey!

78
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Hey!

79
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Hey!

80
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Hey!

81
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Hey!

82
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Hey!

83
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
드려도 되지?

84
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
드려도 되지?

85
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
드려도 되어!

86
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
드려도 되지?

87
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:40,000
You have to do it more and more!

88
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I'm going to beat the A.G. with my mouth!

89
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Let's continue!

90
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Three times!

91
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Ready!

92
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Hey!

93
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
What are you doing?

94
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I'm waiting for you!

95
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Let's go!

96
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
What are you doing?

97
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Hey!

98
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,000
This is Yamada Shokuhachi!

99
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:26,000
It looks like the opponent was really scared.

100
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:32,000
It's 2-1 now, so we still have a long way to go.

101
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Let's continue.

102
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:45,000
The next person, please!

103
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Hey!

104
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I'm sorry.

105
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Hey!

106
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Hey!

107
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,000
You'll understand when you see it.

108
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Hey!

109
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
What are you doing?

110
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I'm waiting for you.

111
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
You're waiting for me?

112
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
What?

113
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Hey!

114
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,000
What are you doing?

115
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I'm going to beat the A.G. with my mouth!

116
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
You have to do it more and more!

117
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
What are you doing?

118
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I'm going to beat the A.G. with my mouth!

119
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
You've already lost!

120
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Please give me a chance!

121
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Please!

122
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I understand.

123
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
If I win this time, I want to win.

124
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Please!

125
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I'll do my best!

126
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
The last person, please!

127
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Ready!

128
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Go!

129
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
What are you doing?

130
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
What are you doing?

131
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Hey!

132
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
What are you doing?

133
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Wait!

134
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
You can't beat me!

135
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I'll beat you!

136
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
You can't beat me!

137
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Okay!

138
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
What are you doing?

139
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I'm waiting for you!

140
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
You've already lost!

141
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
What are you doing?

142
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
What are you doing?

143
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
What are you doing?

144
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Oh!

145
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I got kicked!

146
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I'm going to beat you!

147
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Oh!

148
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I got kicked!

149
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I'm going to beat you!

150
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Oh!

151
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I'm going to beat you!

152
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
You've already lost!

153
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,000
What are you doing?

154
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
If I win, I can't fight anymore.

155
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I don't care if I'm not good enough.

156
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Oh no!

157
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Let's do it as a special match.

158
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Yes, please.

159
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Say thanks to your master.

160
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Thank you very much.

161
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Then, just one more match.

162
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Just one more match?

163
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Yes.

164
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Then, please step back.

165
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Ladies and gentlemen.

166
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Thank you very much.

167
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Today, we have Mr. Yamazaki.

168
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
How do you say it?

169
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Gatsunatsu Ike.

170
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Gatsunatsu Ike.

171
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Well, that kind of song is good.

172
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Yes.

173
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Yesterday.

174
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Yes.

175
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
The night is over, isn't it?

176
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
The night is over.

177
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Yes.

178
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I went home.

179
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Yes, yes, yes.

180
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
About 4 o'clock.

181
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
At about 3 o'clock in the morning.

182
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I turned around.

183
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
My grandmother was standing there.

184
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
How old was your grandmother?

185
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
She was over 70 years old.

186
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Oh.

187
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I couldn't turn around.

188
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Because my grandmother was standing there.

189
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Oh.

190
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I was trying to get involved with her.

191
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
It was dangerous, so I stopped for a moment.

192
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I dodged her.

193
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I went to her house.

194
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I came to her house.

195
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I opened the shutter.

196
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I went out for a moment.

197
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I thought she was in the back.

198
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
A car was coming out of the house.

199
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Yes, yes, yes.

200
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I got out of the house.

201
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I went to the back of the car.

202
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
My grandmother was standing there.

203
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I was scared at night.

204
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I was scared.

205
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I was very scared.

206
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I was scared.

207
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I thought I should get in the car,

208
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
but the car would break when I saw it quickly.

209
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
ир.

210
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
No, it wouldn't.

211
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I couldn't break it because the car was broken.

212
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
It would break.

213
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I wondered where she was going.

214
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I got in the car.

215
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I closed the door.

216
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I went to my grandmother's house,

217
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
put it in the back and put the car there.

218
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I saw her Frau.

219
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
A otrosong.

220
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
When I looked at her,

221
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:51,000
she was very scared and trying to break the window of the control station of a passenger seat.

222
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I screamed again.

223
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
At 4 o'clock in the night, you screamed twice.

224
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I was really scared.

225
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
That's scary.

226
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
But I opened the window and I was like,

227
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
What?

228
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
You succeeded in making contact for the first time.

229
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I succeeded.

230
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I screamed again.

231
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Because you were scared.

232
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Because I was a scared idiot.

233
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I was like, What?

234
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I thought you were calm.

235
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I thought you were calm.

236
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
What?

237
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
The children.

238
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I was scared.

239
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I was really scared.

240
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I was faster than usual.

241
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
That's scary.

242
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I was like, What should I do?

243
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I thought you were calm.

244
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:48,000
That's why I thought you raised your children.

245
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
What?

246
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
That's what I thought.

247
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I didn't think you were calm.

248
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I thought you were scared of my children.

249
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I was scared.

250
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
That's scary.

251
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Don't say things like that.

252
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
That's scary.

253
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
That means you did something to that old lady.

254
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
There are many things like that.

255
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:19,000
The other day, I was in the car with my writer, Takasu.

256
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
There was an amazing person in the car.

257
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
He didn't do anything.

258
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
There was only one lane, but he went the opposite lane.

259
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
That's the speed of light.

260
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
The traffic light was red.

261
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
When the traffic light was red, he went like this.

262
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
That's not true.

263
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
That's not true.

264
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I was really surprised.

265
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I was surprised.

266
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I thought you took a picture of Mario's star.

267
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
That's the truth.

268
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
That's the truth.

269
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Then he disappeared.

270
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
What?

271
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
That's not true.

272
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,000
There was a car in front of me.

273
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
He went like this.

274
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
When he turned around, he disappeared.

275
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
That's not true.

276
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
That's the truth.

277
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
That's not true.

278
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
That's not true.

279
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
That's not true.

280
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
That's not true.

281
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Speaking of strange, soccer is strange, too.

282
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I think so, too.

283
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I've been saying that since the J-League started.

284
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I didn't say that much about Japanese soccer before that.

285
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
No, it's okay.

286
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
It's okay if you like soccer, but...

287
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
What do you call it?

288
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,000
It's all about the Japanese style.

289
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
That's for sure.

290
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
You can't just say you like it.

291
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
That's not true.

292
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
That's definitely strange.

293
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
What should I say?

294
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Everyone likes soccer, so it's okay to watch soccer.

295
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
It doesn't matter who wins or loses.

296
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
That's the important thing.

297
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Why?

298
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I like soccer.

299
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I like soccer.

300
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
And it's Japan.

301
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I'm a representative of Japan.

302
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I don't like it that much, either.

303
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
There are so many people watching J-League.

304
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
It's amazing, isn't it?

305
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Why do you support either of them?

306
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I like soccer.

307
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Good luck with soccer.

308
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
No, no, no.

309
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
That's not true.

310
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I'm doing my best with soccer.

311
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
That's okay.

312
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Why do you say you win or lose?

313
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
There are so many people watching.

314
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
There's no one to cheer for the ball.

315
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
That's what I think.

316
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
You have a bad character.

317
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
You're like,

318
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Cheer up.

319
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
You're like,

320
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Come on.

321
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
The ball is coming!

322
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
The ball is coming!

323
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I'm cheering for the ball.

324
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
The ball is coming!

325
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
But the numbers don't matter.

326
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I don't care how many people are watching.

327
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I'm worried about the number of people watching.

328
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
The ball is coming!

329
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I'm afraid of the number of people watching.

330
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Ball is coming!

331
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Ball is coming!

332
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
The ball is coming.

333
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
The ball is coming!

334
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I'm cheering for the ball.

335
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
You're so naive.

336
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Don't everyone turn down the game?

337
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Women are very simple. They are easy to get into.

338
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Even though I wasn't interested in soccer at all.

339
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Well, that's me.

340
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I'm a person who misunderstands.

341
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Is that so?

342
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I'm a person who misunderstands women.

343
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
How can you say such a thing?

344
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Do you know?

345
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Do you know about the Macchan Jamba incident?

346
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Ah, when I was in Osaka.

347
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Macchan Jamba incident when I was in Osaka.

348
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
That's just what you say.

349
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
No, that's not it.

350
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
There was such an incident.

351
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Hamada and I were invited to some kind of fashion show.

352
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:02,000
And I got a Jumbo jacket or something.

353
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I said, this is good.

354
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Then he said, I'll send it to you.

355
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
And he sent it to me.

356
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Hamada said, I don't need it, I don't need it.

357
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I left it at the head office.

358
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I left it at the head office.

359
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Don't say such a thing.

360
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I thought it was the same color, but I thought it was the same Jamba function.

361
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I took a step back.

362
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
That's good.

363
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I came, but I left it at the head office.

364
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I don't need it right away, so I left it at the head office.

365
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I said, I'll go get it that day.

366
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
That stupid Hashimoto.

367
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
I don't know.

368
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
What is he doing now?

369
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I quit.

370
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I quit.

371
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Hashimoto, the woman's manager.

372
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Until a while ago, she was with Shinsuke Shimada.

373
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
That stupid woman.

374
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
That stupid woman.

375
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
What woman?

376
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:51,000
There's another ugly woman under that stupid woman.

377
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
There is.

378
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
This woman.

379
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I'm going to take the Jamba little by little.

380
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Do you want to come?

381
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I thought so.

382
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,000
The ugly woman under the woman called Hashimoto.

383
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Is my Jamba on?

384
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Good morning.

385
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
You're busy, aren't you?

386
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
What? No way.

387
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
That's my Jamba.

388
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Is that my Jamba?

389
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
What?

390
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
That's right.

391
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Did you spit it out?

392
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
That's right.

393
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
No, no.

394
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
That's right.

395
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I'm going to wear it next time.

396
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
You can't wear it.

397
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
What?

398
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
No, no.

399
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Give it back to me.

400
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
That's my Jamba, so give it back to me.

401
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:42,000
What?

402
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
She started crying.

403
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
What?

404
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Don't cry.

405
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I'm not that angry with this woman.

406
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Why?

407
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
What are you doing?

408
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Hashimoto.

409
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Hashimoto came and hugged the crying woman.

410
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Wait a minute.

411
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I'm going to say that.

412
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Say it.

413
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Don't.

414
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
What?

415
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Don't.

416
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Don't cry.

417
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
What is it?

418
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
What is it?

419
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Hashimoto came and said,

420
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Hashimoto, this woman has a boyfriend.

421
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Really?

422
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Is that right?

423
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
That woman, her boyfriend,

424
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
he's wearing Hamada's Jamba.

425
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
What?

426
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Is it right?

427
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
So what?

428
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
It's a pair look!

429
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Why do you get hungry when you're hungry?

430
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Why do I get hungry?

431
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Why do you get hungry?

432
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Do I get hungry?

433
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
The beef will come out later

434
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Why? Do I get hungry when I sing?

435
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
No, why do you get hungry?

436
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
No, do I get hungry?

437
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Do I get hungry when I don't eat snacks?

438
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Then isn't that number 2?

439
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
I don't know, but why do I get hungry?

440
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Number 2 is...

441
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Even if you get along, you'll get hungry!

442
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Number 1 will get hungry?

443
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
No!

444
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Number 2 is...

445
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Whose land is the green land?

446
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
You're lying!

447
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Do you think that far?

448
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Then why do I get hungry?

449
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
You'll get hungry!

450
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Why do I get hungry?

451
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Do I get hungry when I don't eat snacks?

452
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I don't know that!

453
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Do I get hungry when I fight?

454
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Even if you get along, you'll get hungry!

455
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
No!

456
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Why do I get hungry?

457
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Do I get hungry when I fight?

458
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Even if you get along, you'll get hungry!

459
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Mother, mother...

460
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Do I get hungry?

461
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
No!

462
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Why do I get hungry?

463
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
It's a counting song! There's even number 10!

464
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
There's no way there is!

465
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Why do I get hungry?

466
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Don't say it!

467
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I'm a third-year high school student.

468
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Actually, it's about my school.

469
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
My school was robbed of money and my bicycle chain was cut off.

470
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Even if I locked it in the locker,

471
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
even if I put my wallet in my bag, it would be stolen.

472
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Is there a school like this?

473
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Of course there is!

474
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Of course there is!

475
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,000
But the one who stole the school lunch money,

476
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
the teacher came in with a strange face,

477
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
and everyone was like, close your eyes!

478
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
There really is!

479
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Has it ever been solved?

480
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Has it ever been solved?

481
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
If you do something like that in school,

482
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
this pencil case,

483
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I had a pencil case with a picture of Chaplin on it.

484
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Oh!

485
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
It's a comedy king!

486
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
It's a comedy king.

487
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
I really liked that pencil case.

488
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Chaplin's pencil case.

489
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:08,000
It was a pencil case that looked like it had a picture printed on it.

490
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
It's not a manga.

491
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,000
There's no line here.

492
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Because it's from the nose.

493
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Yes, yes, yes.

494
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
You get it, right?

495
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I went to play during my break and came back.

496
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
There's a line!

497
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
It's quite annoying to say that.

498
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Who is it!

499
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
It's quite annoying.

500
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
The criminal can't get up at all.

501
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I went to a convenience store I know,

502
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
was it a convenience store or something?

503
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:45,000
There was a painting on the nose of your face.

504
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Take it off!

505
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
There's nothing on my face.

506
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,000
There's a painting on your face.

507
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
While looking at it, I always think,

508
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,000
ah, I'll do my best today as well.

509
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:05,000
That's nice.

510
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,000
I don't know, but I think it's okay.

511
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Let's go!

512
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Let's go!

513
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
He lost, he lost again.

514
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
He lost again.

515
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
That's too bad, Yamazaki-san.

516
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
The opponent was too aggressive.

517
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
That's too bad.

518
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Yamazaki-san, let's give him one more chance.

519
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
One more chance?

520
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
That's enough.

521
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Let's give him one more chance.

522
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Let's go!

523
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Let's go!

524
00:21:47,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Ready!

525
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Yamazaki-san, calm down.

526
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Let's give him one more chance.
