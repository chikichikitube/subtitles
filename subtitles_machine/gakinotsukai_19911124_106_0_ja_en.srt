1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Don't touch me.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Coordinated Operation!

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
OK!

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Awesome!

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Today, we are in Jizodori shopping street in Tsubamu.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
That's right.

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
This is the place called Grandma's Harajuku.

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Is that so?

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I heard that a lot of old ladies gather here.

10
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Is that so?

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
They are looking for a place to die.

12
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
They are looking for a place to die.

13
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Also, I heard that a lot of old ladies shop in this shopping street.

14
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Is that so?

15
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Yes.

16
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
That's why we came here today.

17
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Yes.

00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
We will choose our clothes.

21
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
That's right.

22
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Let's choose.

23
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
OK.

24
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Each of us will bring 30,000 yen.

25
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
OK.

26
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
We will go to the store.

27
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
OK.

Then, we will go to the fashion show.

00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
That's right.

32
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
That's right.

33
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
OK.

34
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Let's go.

35
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
OK.

36
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Let's go.

37
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000

00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Let's go.

39
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Let's go.

40
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Let's go.

41
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Let's go.

42
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Let's go.

43
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Let's go.

44
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Let's go.

45
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Let's go.

46
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Let's go.

47
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Let's go.

48
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Let's go.

49
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I think so.

50
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I can see my friend.

51
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
What do you think?

52
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I see my friend.

53
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Good, good.

54
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
What is it?

55
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I do not know.

56
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Then, buy a hat.

57
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Oh, that's fine.

58
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
But, this hat is fine.

59
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
You know..

60
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
But, That kind of design...

61
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Oh, Oh...

62
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
It's tough.

63
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
That's nice.

64
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
That's nice.

65
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
That's nice.

66
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I do not know.

67
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
That's nice.

68
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
What's this?

69
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
That's nice.

70
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
This is good.

71
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
It's nice.

72
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Yes.

73
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
It's nice, is not it?

74
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Why?

75
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I really found out about it.

76
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Excuse me.

77
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Wow, this hat looks like you've done something.

78
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
It's selling well now.

79
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
These clothes are selling well now.

80
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Even adults can wear this.

81
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
No, you can't.

82
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Why not?

83
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
You can wear this.

84
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I'm a child.

85
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
How old do you think this is?

86
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I don't know.

87
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
You look like a 23-year-old kid.

88
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
It's okay.

89
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
You look like a kid.

90
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
What is this?

91
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
What is this?

92
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Hip-hop.

93
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Hip-hop?

94
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I'm definitely going to buy this.

95
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
You've done it.

96
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
You've chosen a cool outfit.

97
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I've done something amazing.

98
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
What is it?

99
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
The theme is one-piece.

100
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
First, Hamada-kun will change your clothes.

101
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
When you change your clothes, make sure you don't look.

102
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Keep your eyes closed.

103
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
When you come out here and stand here,

104
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
you'll see my naked body for the first time.

105
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
It's not naked.

106
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
It's naked.

107
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I want you to see my naked body.

108
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Here comes the fashionable Hamada-kun.

109
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Hamada-kun, go ahead.

110
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
The theme is one-piece.

111
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
One-piece.

112
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Mom, help me.

113
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
This is my theme.

114
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Please open your eyes.

115
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Go ahead.

116
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
What is this?

117
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I'm curious.

118
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
This is for two-year-olds.

119
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Tell me one thing.

120
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I'm an eight-month-old kid.

121
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Take a look at this.

122
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
This is for one-year-olds.

123
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
This is for one-year-olds.

124
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Thank you.

125
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
My theme is

126
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
what kind of person are you?

127
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Please come out.

128
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Go ahead.

129
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Go ahead.

130
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Open your eyes.

131
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
What is this?

132
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Is this for sale?

133
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
It's a chandelier.

134
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
What is this?

135
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
He is very energetic.

136
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
His legs are

137
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
very strong.

138
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
He is like a chandelier.

139
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Yes, he is.

140
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
He is like a chandelier.

141
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Hamada-kun, you look tired today.

142
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
No, I'm fine.

143
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I've been doing this for a while.

144
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I've been doing this for a while.

145
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I'm tired enough.

146
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
But you are doing this.

147
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
But you are doing this.

148
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
You are like a big-time athlete.

149
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
You are like a big-time athlete.

150
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Why can't you be more energetic?

151
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Why can't you be more energetic?

152
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
That's because

153
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I'm not the main character.

154
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
That's because

155
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I'm not the main character.

156
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I think

157
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Hamada-kun is cuter than Taishu Kase.

158
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I think Hamada-kun is cuter than Taishu Kase.

159
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Well, I got it.

160
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Well, I got it.

161
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
It's quiet.

162
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
What should we talk about?

163
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
What should we talk about?

164
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I don't know.

165
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I don't know.

166
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
What do you want to do again?

167
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
What do you want to do again?

168
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
What do you want to do again?

169
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
When I was in elementary school,

170
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I wanted to be a police officer.

171
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Really?

172
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Really?

173
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
That's right.

174
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
You always said you wanted to be a police officer.

175
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Why do you want to be a police officer?

176
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Why do you want to be a police officer?

177
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Instead of being a police officer,

178
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I want to wear a uniform,

179
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
a uniform and a uniform.

180
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I want to wear that.

181
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I want to be with you.

182
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Hey, come here.

183
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
What are you doing?

184
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
That's my explanation.

185
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Police officers

186
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Why are you so arrogant?

187
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:10,000
When I do something bad, I can't help it, but you suddenly come to me from the first meeting, right?

188
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
So, when I was in high school, I was just riding a bicycle.

189
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Hey, what kind of person are you?

190
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Such a rude thing!

191
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
What kind of person are you?

192
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I know you are Japanese, so what kind of person are you? I told you in Japanese.

193
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
You know that young bird, right?

194
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
They are all older than us.

195
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Why do you say that?

196
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,000
They have grown up watching the sun, so they are always like that.

197
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
That's the generation. So, when they are walking like this, they are always like this.

198
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Don't say that!

199
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I don't know, but I think so.

200
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I really think so.

201
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Really?

202
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
When they are chasing after you.

203
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
That's right.

204
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
That's absolutely right.

205
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
When they are chasing after you, they are always like this.

206
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,000
When they have a headache, they are always like this.

207
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I don't think you can do everything by yourself.

208
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
What kind of person are you?

209
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I am the leader of the circus troupe.

210
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Such a rude person.

211
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Such a rude person.

212
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Answer me seriously.

213
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I really want to be a circus troupe leader.

214
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
How can you be a circus troupe leader?

215
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I don't know that, so I quit.

216
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
What's next?

217
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
What's next?

218
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I want to be a kick-boxer.

219
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
That looks good on you.

220
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I want to wear this.

221
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Let's go to the post office.

222
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
What?

223
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
You have a bad breath.

224
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
It's cold, isn't it?

225
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
It's cold.

226
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
It's cold.

227
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I want to wear a patch.

228
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I don't think it's cold.

229
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I don't say patch.

230
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
What do you say when I don't say patch?

231
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
What do you say when I don't say patch?

232
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
What's that?

233
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
What's that?

234
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
You're in trouble, aren't you?

235
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I don't say long shoes.

236
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
You do.

237
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
How much did you make fun of me?

238
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Do you have rubber boots or something?

239
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
They're weird.

240
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I was watching the news and I got angry.

241
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Himeji, Himeji.

242
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Himeji, Himeji.

243
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Himeji, Himeji.

244
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Himeji, Himeji.

245
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Himeji, Himeji.

246
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Himeji, Himeji.

247
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Today is Himeji.

248
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Himeji people say,

249
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Hello, I'm from Himeji.

250
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Oh, you're from Himeji.

251
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
He's weird.

252
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
He's Kanabun.

253
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Kanabun.

254
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
It's Kanabun.

255
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
It's Kanabun.

256
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
That's Kanegon.

257
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
What you're saying is Kanegon's pronunciation.

258
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
It's Ooyama Masayo's pronunciation.

259
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
It's Kanegon.

260
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
It's Ootteru.

261
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I'm making fun of Osaka.

262
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I think Osaka is a tough place.

263
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I'm scared, I'm scared.

264
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Osaka is scary.

265
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Osaka is full of yakuza.

266
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
In Osaka, even for dinner,

267
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
they serve takoyaki.

268
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
You're making fun of me.

269
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
That's not true.

270
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
That's not true.

271
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
It's not as peaceful as here.

272
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Well, yeah.

273
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
A lot of my acquaintances got beaten up and died.

274
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
It's true.

275
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
It's true.

276
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Right?

277
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
It's true.

278
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
It's true.

279
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Who?

280
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
A lot of my acquaintances got beaten up.

281
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
It's true.

282
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
A lot of my acquaintances got beaten up.

283
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
It's true.

284
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
It's true.

285
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
A lot of my acquaintances got beaten up.

286
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
It's true.

287
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
A lot of my acquaintances got beaten up.

288
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
It's true.

289
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Tokyo has a lot of A-car.

290
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
In Mercedes or BMW.

291
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Osaka is like this.

292
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
You can't come to Osaka if you're in a Mercedes.

293
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:32,000
In Tokyo, there are many big cars in the back of Mercedes.

294
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
They're going like this.

295
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I can't do that.

296
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I can't think of that in Osaka.

297
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
You should do that in Osaka.

298
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
You should do that in Osaka.

299
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I'll kill you if I stop at Shingo-maAPPLAUSE,

300
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I'll kill you if I stop at Shingo-ma earnings.

301
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I'll mess it up.

302
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
What am I supposed to do?

303
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
You should come out right away.

304
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I don't know what I should do.

305
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
It's true.

306
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Don't comeJust keep your feet behind if you like to do that.

307
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
You should step soon.

308
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,000
You can't leave me while I'm being beaten up.

309
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Where are you getting kicked by me?

310
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I don't catch you.

311
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I don't like it.

312
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I'm watching the children's show.

313
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
By the way, I have a question for you two.

314
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Why do you call ginger as gari in a sushi restaurant?

315
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Soy sauce is purple, so it's purple.

316
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
You drink tea at the end, so it's agari.

317
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I got it so far, but I don't know what gari is.

318
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Otare, please answer.

319
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Gari, right?

320
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Gari.

321
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Don't you know?

322
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
What is it?

323
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
What?

324
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
What is it?

325
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
What?

326
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I don't know.

327
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
No, no.

328
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I don't know what it is.

329
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
You're an uneducated person, aren't you?

330
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
You have to expand your antenna more.

331
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I'm going to judge whether what you're saying is right or not.

332
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
So if you have time like me, go abroad and see a lot of things.

333
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I've never heard of you!

334
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
What is it?

335
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Why gari?

336
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I think I said it before, but everything has a name, right?

337
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
For example, this.

338
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
What do you call this?

339
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Wagon.

340
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Wagon.

341
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Wagon.

342
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
This was made by a person named Wagon.

343
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Wagon.

344
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:25,000
It was made by Christine H. Wagon.

345
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
What about the microphone?

346
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
The microphone is also a microphone.

347
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
It's called a microphone.

348
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
What's a microphone?

349
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Mic...

350
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Yoshida.

351
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
What?

352
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
What?

353
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
What are you hesitating about?

354
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Yoshida?

355
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Yoshida?

356
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
It's a microphone called Yoshida.

357
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
It was made by Nikkei Nisei.

358
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
That's why gari.

359
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Gari is completely different from that.

360
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
You don't need to talk like that!

361
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
That's why.

362
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Why don't you say gari?

363
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
What?

364
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Why gari?

365
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Why gari?

366
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:16,000
A craftsman often makes things short, right?

367
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
What's that smell?

368
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
What's that smell?

369
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Lemon scotch or Lesca?

370
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
What's a craftsman?

371
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
A craftsman makes lemon scotch, right?

372
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
What's that? A designer?

373
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
No, no, no.

374
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Everyone says it.

375
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Wait a minute.

376
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
A craftsman makes lemon scotch, right?

377
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
What's a dancer?

378
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
What's a dancer?

379
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
A dancing child is a dancer.

380
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
What?

381
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
A dancing child is a dancer.

382
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
A dancing child is a dancer.

383
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
A dancing child is a dancer.

384
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
A dancing child is a dancer.

385
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
That's enough.

386
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
What's wrong with Lesca?

387
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
That's why.

388
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I've been told the same thing over and over again.

389
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,000
A craftsman makes lemon scotch, but Lesca is a dog.

390
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I don't know if a craftsman is a dog, but that's enough.

391
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
That's why.

392
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,000
That's why gari.

393
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
What?

394
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
What does gari mean?

395
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
You can say it, but it's a long name.

396
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I don't care.

397
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
What's the name of this gari before I omit it?

398
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Gan.

399
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Ectopic.

400
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Sazan.

401
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Fran.

402
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Britannic.

403
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Stone.

404
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Myo.

405
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Rumo.

406
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Riri.

407
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
It's a long name.

408
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I can't remember it at once.

409
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
What was it?

410
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
It's a waste of time.

411
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I don't care.

412
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
What's this?

413
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Can you say Kin-chan's Don?

414
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I saw a very unpleasant scene.

415
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
That's Chibikko Uta Gassen.

416
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Sing a song in the head of Mr. Shichi.

417
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Bow slowly while closing your eyes.

418
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Chibikko Yashiro Aki, who only thinks that he was forced to put on makeup like a child.

419
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I can't stand it anymore.

420
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Mr. Downtown, please do something.

421
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
There are many.

422
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
There are many.

423
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
The parents must have pointed it out.

424
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Basically, I don't like children.

425
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,000
There is nothing more useless than a child.

426
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Everyone is getting tired of it now.

427
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
You were a little kid, too.

428
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I've been good since I was a kid.

429
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Is that so?

430
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Yes.

431
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Children.

432
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
It's stupid.

433
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Suddenly, it's a crisis.

434
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
What?

435
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Nothing has changed since then.

436
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,000
If you do this, I'll say something like this.

437
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Even if I say something, I'm saying something.

438
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
It's stupid.

439
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
It can't be helped.

440
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Even if I do it, I can't bite it at all.

441
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
It's childish.

442
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,000
It's childish.

443
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,000
It's still out.

444
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Where are you going?

445
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
That is.

446
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I really like Shimoneda.

447
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Poop poop.

448
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Poop poop.

449
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
It's a song with a little bit of fushi.

450
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Poop! Poop! Poop!

451
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I have a boyfriend now, but he is a pervert.

452
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
You have a boyfriend?

453
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I have a boyfriend, but...

454
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
You know it.

455
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Read it properly!

456
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Shut up, you idiot!

457
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Where is the idiot?

458
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!

459
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Shut up, you...

460
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
gold medalist!

461
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
You should be angry!

462
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
You dancing hippo!

463
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I have a boyfriend now, but he is a pervert.

464
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
He told me to teach him English, so I went to his house.

465
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
But when I went into his room, he beat me up and beat me up.

466
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
He and I are still in junior high school.

467
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
He beat you up?

468
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
What kind of relationship should we have from now on?

469
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
What if he beats you up?

470
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I think that...

471
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
If you resist, you can't do anything.

472
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
If you really resist?

473
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
If you really resist, you can't do anything.

474
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
There are lots of women, but if they are so badly beaten up,

475
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
you can't say,

476
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
No! Stop!

477
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
that's why you can't do anything.

478
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
It's more than that.

479
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Men and women will feel like this.

480
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Stop it!

481
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
You are already getting pheromones.

482
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Men have to be able to act like that.

483
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
They don't have to look dirty.

484
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
They don't have to look dirty.

485
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
If they are like that, they will think that it is okay.

486
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
That's right.

487
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
It's like this.

488
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Right?

489
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
It's like this.

490
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I've been liking this lately.

491
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
That doesn't make any sense at all.

492
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I was walking on the street at night and I thought there was someone following me.

493
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
When I suddenly turned to the corner.

494
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Wow!

495
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
I can't do it, but I can't stop laughing.

496
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
How do I explain this?

497
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
It's true.

498
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
It's absolutely necessary.

499
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
When I suddenly turned to the corner.

500
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
It's like this.

501
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
I don't know.

502
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
It's like this.

503
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:49,000
But I forgot how long I've been feeling this way.

504
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
You were in grade school, right?

505
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
No, I think it's earlier.

506
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
You think it's earlier?

507
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Yes.

508
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
It's like this.

509
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:01,000
When you think of children, it's a big mistake.

510
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
When you go to the bathroom, there are those people.

511
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:08,000
There are people who are standing up with six people standing up.

512
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
When you go to the bathroom, there are those people.

513
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:21,000
No matter who says this, it's definitely a lie, but the old man is angry.

514
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,000
When I came to the bathhouse, I had a headache, and the old man was very angry.

515
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:30,000
He was shaving his hair at Bandai.

516
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
He was shaving his hair.

517
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,000
When he came, he didn't just sit on the floor.

518
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
He sat down and there was a place to flow.

519
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:45,000
He was shaving his hair there.

520
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:50,000
He said, there is no such thing.

521
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
What is this?

522
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
There is no such thing.

523
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I think he had a fight with his wife.

524
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Why did he have to shave his hair?

525
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
He was told to shave his hair.

526
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
What?

527
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
It's not like I'm a real bastard.

528
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:38,000
What is this?
