00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Actually, today, Yamazaki Hosei will be graduating with this room.

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:32,000
That's right. In the past, I was able to make a fool of myself.

4
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I really feel that such a time has come.

5
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Well, for the time being, let's ask him to appear.

6
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:57,000
This is Yamazaki Hosei. Please come in.

7
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Please come in.

8
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Well, I think that people who are watching TV are wondering what it is about.

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Let's stop feeling dark.

10
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I got married and had a child.

11
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
My wife is Aya.

12
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Well, Aya gives me advice as a comedian.

13
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Do you know how to use this child?

14
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:05,000
My daughter, Momo, doesn't wake up at that time.

15
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
That's why she's sleeping and she can't see.

16
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Do you want to do that for the sake of your child?

17
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Do you think it's better to have a time when your child is awake?

18
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,000
After all, if there is a Golden, I can see it honestly.

19
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
With the whole family.

20
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
From about 7 o'clock.

21
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Yes, I have a lot of time, and that's one of the big reasons.

22
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Well, I've been doing a lot of things for 14 years.

23
00:02:50,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Well, I think it was hard, but I think there were a lot of things to gain.

24
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Well, even if you look back on 14 years, it's hard to say that it's this high.

25
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Well, let's take a look at the famous scene that Yama-chan himself chose.

26
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Then VTR, please.

27
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:34,000
This broadcast is provided by the sponsor you are watching.

28
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Yamasaki Hosei, 35 years old.

29
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:45,000
When I met you, you were full of youth and hope.

30
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:53,000
It's been 14 years since we've been through the same season.

31
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I can't believe I'm going to have a time to say goodbye to you.

32
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Let's look back on your great miracle once again.

33
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
What are you doing?

34
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,000
5th place, Yamasaki Image Up Oogiri.

35
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
You care about your image more than anyone else.

36
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:22,000
We were followed by the script you wrote, and you made us do Oogiri in front of a guest who only laughed at what you said.

37
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
It's not working.

38
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
You can't say this.

39
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
What is the last word of the person who fell into the bathhouse?

40
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Matsumoto-san, the last word of the person who fell into the bathhouse is, help me.

41
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,000
This is the last one.

42
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Melting!

43
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:58,000
And then, bang!

44
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
What is the last word of the person who fell into the bathhouse?

45
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Matsumoto-kun, the last word of the person who fell into the bathhouse is, help me.

46
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Why?

47
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Next!

48
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Yamasaki-san.

49
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
What is the last word of the person who fell into the bathhouse?

50
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Melting!

51
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I wish you were my partner.

52
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I'll go with a letter.

53
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:48,000
The love letter is torn!

54
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Yay!

55
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Thank you!

56
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,000
The 4th battle between Yamasaki and Jimmy.

57
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
A fight between two people who couldn't stand the fight.

58
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
We've witnessed your miracle many times.

59
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
What are you doing in front of a car like this?

60
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
What are you doing?

61
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
What are you doing?

62
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Why did you kick it?

63
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
You know, Yamagaki, you...

64
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
You can't...

65
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
You can't...

66
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
You can't...

67
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,000
You can't...

68
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
It's hot!

69
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
It's hot!

70
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
It's hot!

71
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Yuta is an old man.

72
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:01,000
It's like a runny nose.

73
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Let's go, Jimmy!

74
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
It's hot!

75
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:19,000
It's hot!

76
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:24,000
3rd place, Goodbye, Yamasaki Hosei.

77
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
A year ago, you said you were going to quit the show.

78
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
You surprised the whole nation.

79
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:37,000
At that time, I didn't think a day like today would really come.

80
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Yama-chan!

81
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Stop using kids!

82
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Yama-chan!

83
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Stop using kids!

84
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Stop it!

85
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Stop it!

86
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Stop it, girls!

87
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Stop it, stop it, Yama-chan!

88
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Stop it, stop it, Yama-chan!

89
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,000
2nd place, Yamasaki Hosei's moving wedding ceremony.

90
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
You were always everyone's idol, but you're finally getting married.

91
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:47,000
We all saw a part of that moving moment, didn't we?

92
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:59,000
This is amazing.

93
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:05,000
What is this?

94
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
It's like a wedding how-to video.

95
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
What is this?

96
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:21,000
It's a beautiful video.

97
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:26,000
What?

98
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
No way!

99
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
No way!

100
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
What is this?

101
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
No way!

102
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
What is this?

103
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
No way!

104
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,000
1st place, after the rain, everyone gathers.

105
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Stop! Stop!

106
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,000
During the recording, Hamada suddenly gets mad at Tanaka.

107
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:07,000
What is this?

108
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
It's a lie!

109
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Hamada, who is overpowering his juniors, admires his wildness.

110
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I want to erase it after the rain.

111
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
After the rain?

112
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Yes.

113
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Wait, I'm going to cry.

114
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Why?

115
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I'm going to hold it in with my strength.

116
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I'm going to hold it in with my strength.

117
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Kodon Tozai!

118
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Names of flowers!

119
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Names of flowers!

120
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Okay!

121
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Rose!

122
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Okay!

123
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Okay, rose, okay!

124
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Tulip!

125
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Oh, I got it!

126
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Yuriko, Yuriko, Yuriko!

127
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Yuriko!

128
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I got it!

129
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Chibino wins!

130
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I got it!

131
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Yutaka, you just barely made it.

132
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Your turn to lose.

133
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
You're not going to make it.

134
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I'm not going to make it.

135
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
It's not written in here.

136
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
You're not frustrated, are you?

137
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
You're going to say it out loud?

138
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Ichiwa asked me to say it out loud.

139
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
What did you say the atmosphere was?

140
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
What did he say?

141
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
He said it in his own words.

142
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
He said it in his own words!

143
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
What are you doing?

144
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
What are you doing?

145
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Hey!

146
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Hey!

147
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Hey!

148
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Where are you going?

149
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I'm sorry.

150
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:31,000
It hurts!

151
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
It's raining!

152
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
It's raining!

153
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
You're kidding me!

154
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Don't cry!

155
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
You're kidding me!

156
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
You're acting!

157
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I'm going to hold you down and drop kick you.

158
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Are you okay?

159
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,000
It's been 14 years since you were a kid.

160
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
It's been a long time.

161
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:20,000
How many times did you get dirty for the show and cry?

162
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:28,000
You, who devoted everything to laughter, will never disappear from our minds forever.

163
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I wish time would stop.

164
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,000
The more I think about it, the bigger your presence was.

165
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
But it's goodbye.

166
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Goodbye, and thank you for the memories.

167
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
How do you feel, Yama-chan?

168
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
You have special memories.

169
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
That's right.

170
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
That's why my image-up strategy...

171
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Oh, the ogiri.

172
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Yes, that's right.

173
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I'm sorry. I just remembered.

174
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I told you that I would never cry.

175
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I feel like it's a waste to cry.

176
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I'd like to say goodbye to the producer, Suwa-san.

177
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Thank you for your hard work, Yama-chan.

178
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I'm really sorry for all the bad jokes I've said so far.

179
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I thought I wouldn't quit until last year.

180
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I'm really sorry to hear that.

181
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Thank you very much.

182
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Thank you very much.

183
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Let's go here.

184
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Let's start with here.

185
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Thank you for 14 years.

186
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Thank you.

187
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,000
This may be a personal story, but...

188
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I've been in Tokyo for 10 years.

189
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Personally, you've been really nice to me.

190
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I think you've given me a lot of love.

191
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I'm sorry I couldn't answer you well.

192
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I've been using the instrument since the second time.

193
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,000
At first, I was watching you on TV.

194
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Then I joined you.

195
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I've always been chasing after you.

196
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:12,000
At one point, I lost you.

197
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Thank you for chasing after me at that time.

198
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Thank you very much.

199
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I only had the opportunity to work with Yama-chan.

200
00:15:49,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I don't think I'll be able to work with Yama-chan anymore.

201
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I can only say goodbye and do my best.

202
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:12,000
The staff of this program are also my family.

203
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I want to work with my real family.

204
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Thank you very much.

205
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Finally, Yama-chan.

206
00:16:49,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Please say goodbye to everyone.

207
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Do you think I can get a bouquet of flowers like this?

208
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:59,000
For 14 years, I've been an instrument user for 14 years.

209
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:09,000
It's important to have friends.

210
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I can't say anything anymore.

211
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Thank you very much.

212
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Thank you very much.

213
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Thank you very much.

214
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:10,000
At the end of the program, I couldn't say anything.

215
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:16,000
We became four people.

216
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:23,000
It's easier to divide the program into four people.

217
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Yama-chan won't stop being an instrument user.

218
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Are you surprised?

219
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:49,000
This is the third time.

220
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Yama-chan won't stop being an instrument user.

221
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Yama-chan won't stop being an instrument user.

222
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Thank you very much.

223
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Yama-chan won't stop being an instrument user.

224
00:20:48,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Thank you very much.

225
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Yama-chan won't stop being an instrument user.

226
00:21:37,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Yama-chan won't stop being an instrument user.

227
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Yama-chan won't stop being an instrument user.

228
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Thank you very much.

229
00:22:33,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Yama-chan won't stop being an instrument user.

230
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Thank you very much.

231
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Everyone gather!

232
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Think carefully.

233
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Yama-chan is important.

234
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Stop!
