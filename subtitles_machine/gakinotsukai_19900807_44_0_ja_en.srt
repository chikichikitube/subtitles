1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Ladies and gentlemen

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
How long are you going to do this?

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Today is a special day

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Is that so?

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
There is no useless talk today

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Why?

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I think everyone knows

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
But I bet on it and the result came out

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I bet on it

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I bet on it, you bet on it

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Yes

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I lost the bet

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Yes

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
As expected

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
As expected

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Well

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
If I lose?

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
If I lose, I will do skydiving

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
But I already did it

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I did it

21
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I will show you everything today

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
That's great

23
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
That's great

24
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
The people who came today are already lucky

25
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Let's take a look at the monitor

26
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Do you want to take a picture?

27
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Have you all seen it?

28
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Right?

29
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Until the end?

30
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Yes

31
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
What?

32
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Have you all seen it?

33
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
This is the first time I have seen a baseball game like this

34
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Let's take a look

35
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Everyone, please look at the monitor

36
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Yes

37
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Here you go

38
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
It's hot

39
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
It's dark because it's night

40
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
It's dark

41
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
It came out

42
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
It's okay to shake your hand in front of the cameraman

43
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I want to fly

44
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I want to fly

45
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I can't stand it

46
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
It's so scary

47
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I will go home

48
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
It's scary

49
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
It's scary

50
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
What are you talking about?

51
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I don't know what you are talking about

52
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I'm going to turn it

53
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I will turn it

54
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I will turn it

55
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Turn it

56
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Turn it

57
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Turn it

58
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Turn it

59
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Turn it

60
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Turn it

61
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Turn it

62
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Turn it

63
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Turn it

64
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,000
How many rounds are you going to aim for?

65
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I won't do it.

66
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
What?

67
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Did you take any medicine last night?

68
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
No, I didn't.

69
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Do you have anything to say to your child?

70
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Even if I don't have a father,

71
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I want him to grow up healthily.

72
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
At first, I took off from the plane,

73
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
and before the parachute opened,

74
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I took off at a free fall.

75
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
At a speed of about 200 to 250 kilometers per hour,

76
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I took off at a speed of about 40 seconds per hour.

77
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Did you take off at a speed of about 40 seconds per hour?

78
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I took off at a speed of about 40 seconds per hour.

79
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Why did you do that?

80
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Please open the parachute.

81
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I took off at a speed of about 40 seconds per hour.

82
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Now, the camera is in the middle of the face.

83
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I took off at a speed of about 40 seconds per hour.

84
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I took off at a speed of about 40 seconds per hour.

85
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I took off at a speed of about 40 seconds per hour.

86
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I took off at a speed of about 40 seconds per hour.

87
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
How are you doing?

88
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,000
How are you doing?

89
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,000
This is a small gift from the staff.

90
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:00,000
This is a hand-carrying bag.

91
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
This is a small gift from the staff.

92
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
This is a small gift from the staff.

93
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
This is a small gift from the staff.

94
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,000
This is a hand-carrying bag.

95
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I don't need this.

96
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I don't need this.

97
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I don't need this.

98
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I'm called the lady plaster.

99
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Thank you very much

100
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,200
It looks like he is under construction.

101
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:57,040
It looks like he is a beauty contest 일반大學這所

102
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:57,940
Wait, what the heck…

103
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:00,240
Ok, ready?

104
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:27,520
So that's the whole story.

105
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,520
Up to the first half

106
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,520
You and I went on the Setsuna together, right?

107
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,520
Yes, yes

108
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:37,520
Even just that, it was pretty scary

109
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,520
Eh?

110
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,520
Of course it was scary to jump off

111
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:45,520
But I experienced about 4 out of 5 of your fear

112
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,520
I didn't, I didn't

113
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,520
That's too much, but I was scared of 1 out of 10

114
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,520
I couldn't say anything

115
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:55,520
It was scary, because it was a sudden Setsuna

116
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,520
So I said to Maachan to get on too

117
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,520
So I got on

118
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,520
I was floating up there

119
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:06,520
At that time, I counted my head, and there were 10 people on it

120
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,520
Eh? I thought

121
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:11,520
Everyone was carrying parachutes, so it was heavy

122
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,520
That's why it was scary

123
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,520
Eh?

124
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,520
I thought it was pretty scary, but I was told it was about 1,000 meters

125
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,520
But 1,000 meters was the scariest

126
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:21,520
If I went any higher, I wouldn't know what was going on

127
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,520
You wouldn't know what was going on

128
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,520
Yes, yes

129
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,520
It was pretty scary after that

130
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,520
I was moved

131
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:33,520
I don't know if I'll be able to cry today

132
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:40,520
It's about 1,000 meters high

133
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,520
Eh?

134
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,520
It's about 4,000 meters high

135
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,520
It's about 4,000 meters high

136
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,520
It's still 1 out of 4

137
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,520
It's the worst

138
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:53,520
It's really scary

139
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,520
Well

140
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,520
If

141
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:06,520
If I say that I'm going to quit

142
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,520
I won't stop

143
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:11,520
I'll say that's right

144
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,520
You don't have to fly

145
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,520
If this is a joke

146
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,520
It's really scary

147
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:37,520
It's 3,500 meters high

148
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:43,520
It's 3,500 meters high

149
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:53,520
It's really scary

150
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,520
It's cold and scary

151
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:18,520
My body won't move

152
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,520
Can I take off my jacket?

153
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,520
Yes

154
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:29,520
What are you doing?

155
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:34,520
It's about time

156
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:43,520
I'm going

157
00:09:43,520 --> 00:10:06,520
It's scary

158
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:10,520
I'm about to cry

159
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:18,520
I'm about to cry

160
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:29,520
It's funny

161
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:33,520
I can't stand it

162
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:43,520
I'm about to cry

163
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:49,520
I can't stand the speed

164
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,520
I can't stand it anymore

165
00:10:51,520 --> 00:11:06,520
It's scary

166
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:13,520
This music

167
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:16,520
I don't know this song

168
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:19,520
I was really excited

169
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:22,520
I'm going down

170
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:25,520
Hamada

171
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,520
Do you understand?

172
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:31,520
I'm waving my hand

173
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:36,520
Hamada

174
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,520
I'm going down

175
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,520
I can hear the voice

176
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,520
I can hear the voice

177
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,520
I can hear the voice

178
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:48,520
I'm going down

179
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:56,520
I'm waving my hand

180
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,520
Hamada

181
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,520
I'm going down

182
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,520
I'm Hamada

183
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,520
I'm Ozora

184
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:05,520
Can I land safely with both feet?

185
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:08,520
Landing is the problem

186
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:11,520
I'm going down

187
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:26,520
Landing is the problem

188
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:33,520
I'm going to take it off

189
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:36,520
I can't express it in words

190
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,520
Thank you

191
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,520
I'm fine

192
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,520
Please come

193
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:44,520
I'm moved

194
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:47,520
Did you open your eyes from the beginning to the end?

195
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:50,520
I opened my eyes

196
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:55,520
I'm moved

197
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,520
Thank you

198
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:07,520
Thank you

199
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:24,520
I can't express it in words

200
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:32,520
I can do it again

201
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,520
I landed

202
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:38,520
Thank you

203
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,520
I really

204
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:44,520
I don't know if I should praise you

205
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:52,520
It was amazing

206
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:56,520
I almost cried

207
00:13:56,520 --> 00:14:06,520
I was scared

208
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,520
I was scared

209
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:14,520
I was shaking when I landed

210
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:18,520
I couldn't control it

211
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:24,520
I couldn't control it

212
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,520
Don't say that

213
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:29,520
I was scared

214
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,520
The face of a pilot

215
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:39,520
I can't forget the scene when I landed from the top

216
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:43,520
It was amazing

217
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:55,520
I've never seen anything like that

218
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:34,520
I can't express it in words

219
00:15:34,520 --> 00:16:00,520
I can't control it

220
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:20,520
It was amazing

221
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:29,520
That's all

222
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:32,520
But you don't look nervous

223
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:35,520
When you went up, you opened your mouth

224
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,520
I opened my mouth

225
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:45,520
The picture we took on the way was taken by the person who put the camera on the helmet

226
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:50,520
He took a picture of us and came back later

227
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:54,520
I was shaking and he was right in front of me

228
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,520
We took pictures with our heads together

229
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,520
That was amazing

230
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,520
Everyone was shaking

231
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:05,520
I couldn't control it

232
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,520
I was scared

233
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:14,520
I couldn't control it

234
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:17,520
It was amazing

235
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:24,520
At first, I was scared that I would die if I didn't open my mouth

236
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:28,520
But when I opened my mouth, I couldn't breathe

237
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:31,520
I couldn't control it

238
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:38,520
I couldn't control it

239
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:43,520
When everyone looked at me, my mouth was closed

240
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:49,520
I couldn't feel the excitement on the screen

241
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:54,520
It's the same when you look at it from above

242
00:17:54,520 --> 00:18:03,520
When the old man and the young woman took the picture, I couldn't control it

243
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:08,520
I was like, what are you doing?

244
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,520
I was scared

245
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,520
It was really fast

246
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:14,520
It was creepy

247
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:19,520
I couldn't control it

248
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,520
I thought I would die if I looked at it from above

249
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:25,520
But I couldn't control it

250
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,520
I couldn't see it on the screen

251
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:31,520
The old man was coming to me

252
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:36,520
When the staff went to the top and came to 3000 meters

253
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:40,520
The old man said, this is my present

254
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:43,520
I was like, what are you doing?

255
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,520
I was scared

256
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,520
But I was told that it was my present

257
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:51,520
I was like, what are you doing?

258
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:54,520
You didn't do anything

259
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:58,520
I was like, what are you doing?

260
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,520
I couldn't control it

261
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:03,520
It was the worst

262
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,520
I couldn't control it

263
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,520
I was moved

264
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:13,520
I was like, what are you doing?

265
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:17,520
I couldn't control it

266
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:22,520
I was like, what are you doing?

267
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:26,520
It was really fast

268
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:29,520
I was embarrassed

269
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,520
I was scared

270
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:34,520
I was scared

271
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:38,520
I couldn't control it

272
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:41,520
I was like, what are you doing?

273
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:58,560
Why did the person who was

274
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,560
I don't know what you're talking about

275
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,560
If it was in slow motion, it would be cool

276
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,560
It was in slow motion!

277
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,560
Are you stupid?

278
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,560
At that time, the music was like

279
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,560
What is this?

280
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,560
What is this?

281
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,560
I don't know what to say

282
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,560
I want to ride on the orchestra

283
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:20,560
I want to do that kind of thing again

284
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:24,560
But after this, we are waiting for you

285
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,560
If I say something good, I might be able to impress you

286
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:30,560
This time, let's go to the main battle

287
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,560
So, today...

288
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:34,560
You watched the punishment game

289
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,560
The content was very good

290
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:40,560
It costs 2-3 million to fly that

291
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,560
That's right

292
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,560
This program costs money

293
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:46,560
Even though the set is like this

294
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:51,560
At that time, I really thought that the staff didn't want to pay

295
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:54,560
At first, I ate pilaf, and then napolitan

296
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:58,560
I was very impressed today

297
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,560
I did it

298
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:04,560
But I didn't do it to impress you

299
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,560
I was very impressed

300
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:10,560
I don't know if I will do the punishment game again

301
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,560
I will do that

302
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:16,560
If you do that, you will do something more than that

303
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:20,560
I don't know if I can do that

304
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:24,560
I don't know if I will do it again

305
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:26,560
I don't know if I will do it again

306
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:30,560
Why do you have to be punished while doing the program?

307
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:34,560
I have a little question

308
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,560
If you don't enjoy it, you won't be able to do it

309
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:40,560
I don't know if I will do it again

310
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:44,560
I don't do anything for the event

311
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,560
And also

312
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:50,560
I want to do the punishment game with you

313
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,560
I had something

314
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,560
Is that so?

315
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,560
I have something

316
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,560
I have something

317
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:01,560
I had something

318
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:04,560
I don't have something that is not

319
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:07,560
Let's go to the main battle this time

320
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,560
That's right

321
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,560
Let's go to see you

322
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:13,560
That's right

323
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:15,560
Really?

324
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,560
Yes, really.

325
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:20,560
But I don't want to talk to you if I get caught.

326
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,560
Hmm...

327
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:24,560
I don't know what you're talking about.

328
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:27,560
At that time, I didn't have the guts.

329
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:31,560
I don't know what you're talking about.

330
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,560
I want to go to the main battle.

331
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,560
I'm looking for your ideas.

332
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,560
Yes.

333
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:39,560
You can write a lot of things.

334
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:43,560
I'm looking for your ideas.

335
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:44,560
And...

336
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:47,560
I told you to put only male characters.

337
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:49,560
I'm looking for your ideas.

338
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:54,560
I want to do it with only male characters.

339
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,560
Basically, you can put only male characters.

340
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:57,560
That's right.

341
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:02,560
I want to do it with only male characters.

342
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:04,560
I want to do it with only male characters.

343
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:12,560
That's right.
