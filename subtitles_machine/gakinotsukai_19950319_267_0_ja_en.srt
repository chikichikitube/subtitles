1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
GENERATION OGAE SOUCHANKA GRAND PRIX!

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Today's guests are lucky!

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
They are the best!

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Let me introduce them again.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
First of all, Mr. Otake Makoto!

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I have to do what you expect me to do.

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
What are you talking about?

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I have to eat for the next 5 years.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Why 5 years?

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I have to be like you.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
That's enough!

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
What do you mean you have to be like me?

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Stop right there!

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
You're a criminal!

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Don't look down on the police!

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Sit down!

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Next to me is Mr. Kano Tenmei!

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Next to me is Mr. Matsumoto Itoshi!

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
You don't like it, do you?

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
You don't want me to be one of them.

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
You don't like it?

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
But you're the most decent one, aren't you?

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
That's a compliment.

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
The first question is this!

25
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
You're spraying a black spray on your head!

26
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,000
You can't be on TV if you don't spray a black spray!

27
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Read it more normally.

28
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Your words are terrible.

29
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I think you're going to make me do something amazing.

30
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
What should I do?

31
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Please write it on the back of your head.

32
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
You're going to get bald, aren't you?

33
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Jin, you're shaking.

34
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
You're stuck.

35
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Don't go anywhere without touching anything.

36
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Everyone in the world doesn't know who you are.

37
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Especially in the Kanto area.

38
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I've been next to this person.

39
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
He's wearing a beige suit.

40
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
He sprays a black spray on a beige suit.

41
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Please don't do that.

42
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
What should I do?

43
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Someone's here.

44
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Wait a minute, everyone.

45
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Someone's here or someone's here.

46
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
That's what I'm saying.

47
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I'm going to take this out because it's useless.

48
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
If it's useless, you don't have to take it out.

49
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
It's useless, so don't use it.

50
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
It's the worst.

51
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
It's a story of a spray.

52
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Don't use it.

53
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Don't use it.

54
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Don't use it.

55
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
It's okay.

56
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
It's dangerous.

57
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
It's okay.

58
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Everyone knows that.

59
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I helped you.

60
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
From Mr. Otake.

61
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Mr. Otake.

62
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Kishin Hiroyama.

63
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I'm sorry.

64
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Are you sorry?

65
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
You're talking about our business.

66
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
You wrote it.

67
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
You're a criminal, so you have to say something.

68
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I'll tell you some information.

69
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
He's doing this.

70
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
He's doing it.

71
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I was sick of something.

72
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
When Mr. Kishin came in,

73
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,000
When the wind blows in the western play,

74
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I'm going to have a stinging smell.

75
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
You're going.

76
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I said, and I said, what's coming?

77
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I want a stinging smell.

78
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Mr. Kishin didn't have anything.

79
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Wait a minute.

80
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Does that mean there's nothing?

81
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
No.

82
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I'm saying this for the sake of the photo session.

83
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
There's no such thing.

84
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Then I heard about it.

85
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I went to Mr. Kishin's house.

86
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
There's a lot of it.

87
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I'm going to spray it in the room.

88
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I'm going to spray it in the room.

89
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
What's that?

90
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I told you.

91
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
What's that?

92
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I heard it.

93
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Sit down.

94
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Let's go to Mr. Tenmei.

95
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I think this is a normal place.

96
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Yes.

97
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I see.

98
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Now, Mr. Matsumoto.

99
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Well, I'm the only one.

100
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
This is that.

101
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I see.

102
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
When the autumn festival came out,

103
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
He was the one who looked down from the top of the stairs.

104
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
It's amazing.

105
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
It's like a billiard number eight.

106
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Tamori.

107
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Kenji Moriwaki.

108
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Toshi-chan.

109
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Kume-san.

110
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Tamori.

111
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Ishida Junichi.

112
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Masakazu Tamura.

113
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
It's a hot topic.

114
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Toshi-chan.

115
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Hiroshi Tatsu.

116
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Kenji Moriwaki.

117
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Toshi-chan.

118
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Kenji Moriwaki.

119
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Because he has a nori-like head.

120
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Mr. Tenmei is correct.

121
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Mr. Tenmei is correct.

122
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
The next question is...

123
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Here it is.

124
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
No one has seen your room clothes.

125
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
You idiot.

126
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
What the hell are you doing?

127
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Here you are.

128
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
This is that, isn't it?

129
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Have you ever taken it out?

130
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
No, I haven't.

131
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
In short, you haven't seen it, have you?

132
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I haven't.

133
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I just want to see it.

134
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I don't want to see it, but...

135
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
That's a runaway, isn't it?

136
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I think it's a little embarrassing.

137
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
This...

138
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
FranÃ§ois Morel.

139
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I don't want to see it, either.

140
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Everyone is moving.

141
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
You like foreigners, don't you?

142
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
John Shepard.

143
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Someone is talking.

144
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Helen.

145
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Stop being a foreigner.

146
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Let's go.

147
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Mako-chan.

148
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Mr. Tenmei is correct.

149
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Why are you hiding your mouth?

150
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Is that for TV?

151
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Mr. Tenmei is correct.

152
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I want to see this, but...

153
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Tanaka Makiko.

154
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
That's fine, isn't it?

155
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I want to see it, but...

156
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I'm a top show, so...

157
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I'll go with this.

158
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Finally, Mr. Matsumoto.

159
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Mr. Tenmei is correct.

160
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Well done.

161
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Mr. Tenmei is correct.

162
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I didn't get this right.

163
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
The third question is...

164
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
This one.

165
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Your face has changed compared to when you debuted, hasn't it?

166
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Your face has changed, hasn't it?

167
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
You've changed a lot, hasn't it?

168
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
It's obviously different.

169
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
There's nothing between you and your friends.

170
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
What's that?

171
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Please show your answers.

172
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
That hasn't changed, has it?

173
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
It has, hasn't it?

174
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
It has, hasn't it?

175
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
It has, hasn't it?

176
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Hey, wait a minute.

177
00:07:50,000 --> 00:08:02,000
This is red, isn't it?

178
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Please show your answers.

179
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
This is red, isn't it?

180
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Please show your answers.

181
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
This is red, isn't it?

182
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Please show your answers.

183
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
This is the most interesting one that everyone has.

184
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Mako-chan, this has changed a bit again.

185
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
That hasn't changed, hasn't it?

186
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
This has changed.

187
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
This was a very shocking answer.

188
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
That's simply because you have a long career, isn't it?

189
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
No, it's this, but isn't it too bad?

190
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
After doing it, it has changed again.

191
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
My daughter has become more mischievous.

192
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Now, Mako-chan.

193
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
You don't need to clap.

194
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
You went to get this, didn't you?

195
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Yes.

196
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Matsumoto-san.

197
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Yamasaki-sensei.

198
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Hama-chan, Hama-chan, Hama-chan.

199
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Doesn't it feel like you're making a mouthful?

200
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
F**k.

201
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
F**k.

202
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Everyone, this is the correct answer.

203
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Hama-chan, why did you come out?

204
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
What did you do?

205
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
My teeth have become short.

206
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Why?

207
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Because they have broken.

208
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
It was long, long time ago.

209
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
It's just this.

210
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
That's why I can see stitches.

211
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I've been told many things.

212
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Regarding this matter, even if I talk about it in detail, I'll cut it anyway.

213
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
That's why it's not that it hasn't broken for a long time.

214
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
What are you looking at?

215
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
The last question is this.

216
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Omae M*****

217
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Thank you very much.

218
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
That's it, that's it, that's it.

219
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Omae, is it S or M?

220
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
For me, it's S.

221
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
No, S is...

222
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
That's why it's S.

223
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
The one who does it.

224
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Which one?

225
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
If I do it like this, you'll think, right?

226
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Right?

227
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Ah, yes, yes, yes.

228
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Eh?

229
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
But there's a point to it.

230
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I don't get it.

231
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
If I do it like this, you'll think I'm stupid.

232
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Ah, that's not it, that's not it.

233
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
No, really.

234
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
If I say something like this, I don't know if you'll misunderstand, but...

235
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I want you to be a little emotional.

236
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
No, no, no.

237
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I...

238
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Kaimu!

239
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
No, no, no.

240
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I want you to be a little emotional!

241
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I can see your throat!

242
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
This is...

243
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
This is...

244
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
This is...

245
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
No, I can't wear glasses.

246
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Don't be angry.

247
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
This is really...

248
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
What are you doing?

249
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
What are you doing with sports glasses?

250
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
This is...

251
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I'm not saying this to make you laugh.

252
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I'm not saying this to make you laugh.

253
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
You know, a long time ago...

254
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I'm not saying this to make you laugh.

255
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
There's nothing, right?

256
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I have a habit of saying that on that day.

257
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I don't have a habit, but there's nothing.

258
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I'm not saying this to make you laugh.

259
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Leave me alone.

260
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I'm curious about it.

261
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
So I want you to think of me as someone who wears glasses.

262
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I understand. I'll do that. Sorry.

263
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I won't talk about it.

264
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I'll talk about it.

265
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I won't talk about it.

266
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
That's impossible.

267
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
When I went to the hospital,

268
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I got a big finger in my ass.

269
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Yes, yes.

270
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Two fingers.

271
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Yes.

272
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I got my legs raised.

273
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I got my legs raised.

274
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I really hate it.

275
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
It hurts.

276
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I really hate it.

277
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
It's not like that.

278
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I'm not going to do that.

279
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I'm not going to do that.

280
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I didn't laugh, but I laughed a little.

281
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
While you were laughing?

282
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
No, I didn't laugh that much.

283
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I didn't laugh half-heartedly.

284
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Hey.

285
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
That's a grim face.

286
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
That's a mischievous face.

287
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
No, no, no.

288
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
There's something like that.

289
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Anyone.

290
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
No, that's not it.

291
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I don't get it.

292
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I don't get it.

293
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Really?

294
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I'm a bad person.

295
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
That's right.

296
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Lately,

297
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
there are people who call me all the time on my cell phone.

298
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Right?

299
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
There are a lot of messages on the phone.

300
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
It costs 100 yen to listen to a message once.

301
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
If you do it 10 times a day, it's 1000 yen.

302
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I see.

303
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
If you do it all the time, it's no good.

304
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Hey.

305
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Why do you know my cell phone number?

306
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Because I teach you a lot of things.

307
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
That's fine.

308
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I don't care.

309
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I'll teach you if you don't do it.

310
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I didn't do that.

311
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
That's right.

312
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
But I'm telling you that you're going to break up with the person I taught you.

313
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I don't teach you that much.

314
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I don't teach you that much.

315
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
It's just Yoshinaga Sayuri.

316
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Are you stupid?

317
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Where did you put it?

318
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
That's right.

319
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Tell me.

320
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
You're the bad guy.

321
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Don't say that.

322
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
The one who calls me is the worst.

323
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
You're the one who gave me a lot of information on my cell phone.

324
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Do you know my cell phone number?

325
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I won't tell you even if I have it.

326
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I see.

327
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I see.

328
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I don't know if it's in a cell phone called Bomber Head.

329
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
No, it's not in here.

330
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Why?

331
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I asked you before the show and it was still in there.

332
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I can put it in there.

333
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I asked you before the show.

334
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
What is it?

335
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Why can't you recommend it?

336
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Where are you looking?

337
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
What are you doing?

338
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I can't eat anything.

339
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
What are you doing?

340
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
You can't use money for this.

341
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I heard that there was a model somewhere.

342
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Which model was it?

343
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Super model.

344
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
It was 600 million yen a year.

345
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I have nothing.

346
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I have to get more.

347
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I have to get more.

348
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,000
That's why it's not a good idea to buy an instrument and put it in for free.

349
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I don't know how much it will cost.

350
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
But when it comes out, I'll give you a discount.

351
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Do you want it?

352
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I don't know what it is.

353
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I don't know what it is.

354
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I don't know what it is.

355
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Why do you want something sweet?

356
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I'm scared.

357
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I want a cookie.

358
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
You don't need it.

359
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Why do you want it?

360
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
It's hard to find it.

361
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I'll dig up the Genji pie.

362
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I can't give you anything.

363
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
You're right.

364
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I'm scared.

365
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Then I'll give you something sweet.

366
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
You're targeting me.

367
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
You're a man with a knife.

368
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
You're talking to me.

369
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
You're holding a knife from the other side.

370
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
You're not aware of Matsumoto.

371
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
You're not aware of SOS Matsumoto.

372
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
What are you going to do when it's over?

373
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Are you going to help me?

374
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
But I'm in danger, too.

375
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
That's the difference.

376
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
What are you going to do?

377
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
What I'm good at is ninja arts.

378
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I'm talking too much.

379
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I'm going to use the circle I always have.

380
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
What?

381
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
You're going to disappear.

382
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
What are you going to do if someone like this comes?

383
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
What?

384
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
What are you going to do if someone like this comes?

385
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Like this?

386
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Wait a minute.

387
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Keep your feet still.

388
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Why are you doing this?

389
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I'm talking about Jitaba.

390
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
If you do that, I'll run away.

391
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
What?

392
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
What are you going to do?

393
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
What?

394
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
What?

395
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
It won't go out.

396
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
It's normal to disappear like this.

397
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
After this...

398
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
What are you going to do if someone like this comes?

399
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I'm going to run away.

400
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Matsumoto.

401
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:39,500
Aiii!

402
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:45,500
You should have said Aiii instead of Aiii!

403
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:49,500
You should have said Aiii instead of Aiii!

404
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,500
Who are you?

405
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:54,500
I'll throw it for the team.

406
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,500
First of all, please tell us about your life in detail.

407
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:04,500
If I say something like this, you might misunderstand me.

408
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:09,500
Then don't say anything.

409
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,500
Why did you disappear?

410
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:20,500
I was in contact with Lamborghini.

411
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:28,500
I was wondering what to do with this story.

412
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:31,500
If you say something like this, you might misunderstand me.

413
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,500
Then don't say anything.

414
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,500
Wait a minute!

415
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:36,500
It's a broadcast code.

416
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,500
It's a very dangerous situation.

417
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,500
What was I doing?

418
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,500
I'm doing my best to live now.

419
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:58,500
If I say something like this, you might misunderstand me.

420
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,500
You don't have a face.

421
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:09,500
I'll think about it after I put it in my mouth.

422
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:13,500
It's funny.

423
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,500
Was I like that?

424
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:18,500
I was laughing when I fell into the water.

425
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:22,500
What is that?

426
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:25,500
I don't know what you're talking about.

427
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,500
You're scary.

428
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,500
I bought a Macintosh recently.

429
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:37,500
If you double-click the system holder of the hard disk, the icon will disappear.

430
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,500
Why?

431
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,500
I don't know.

432
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:43,500
I'm sorry, but I don't know.

433
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,500
I don't know what you're talking about.

434
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:50,500
You were that kind of person.

435
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:53,500
Wait a minute.

436
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,500
It's a long time ago.

437
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:02,500
What do you mean by double-clicking the system holder of the hard disk?

438
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,500
I double-click twice.

439
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,500
I double-click twice.

440
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:08,500
Wait a minute.

441
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,500
I double-click twice.

442
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:14,500
It's a machine, isn't it?

443
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:15,500
It's a machine.

444
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,500
What do you mean by double-clicking twice?

445
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,500
There's a string.

446
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,500
A string?

447
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,500
There's something like a string.

448
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,500
I double-click twice.

449
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,500
Isn't it a system holder?

450
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:32,500
There's something like this.

451
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,500
You're so cute.

452
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:38,500
Well, it's attached, but it doesn't matter.

453
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,500
The microcomputer will disappear.

454
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:42,500
If you do that?

455
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,500
That's right.

456
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,500
It will disappear.

457
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,500
It will disappear.

458
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,500
Why?

459
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,500
Of course.

460
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,500
That's the final stage.

461
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,500
There are times when it can't be helped.

462
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,500
What if I do that?

463
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,500
If you do that, everything will disappear.

464
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,500
What?

465
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,500
If I take out the outlet, everything will disappear?

466
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,500
It won't disappear.

467
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,500
Do you remember that?

468
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:07,500
Yes, I do.

469
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,500
Is that so?

470
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,500
Tell me how to deal with it.

471
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:15,500
There's a green lamp on the back.

472
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,500
I'll replace it with a red lamp.

473
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,500
This is very difficult.

474
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,500
You're going to replace the lamp?

475
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,500
It's a fake video.

476
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,500
Tell me how to deal with it.

477
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,500
Tell me how to deal with it.

478
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,500
You do that when you watch it, right?

479
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,500
It's a video.

480
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,500
You have to change the input.

481
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,500
In the end, it's easy to say.

482
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,500
You don't know the structure, do you?

483
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,500
I don't know, so I'm asking.

484
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,500
It's a dead mouth that fell into the sea.

485
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:47,500
Why don't you know if it's dead?

486
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,500
Don't talk about your past life.

487
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,500
I don't know what you're talking about.

488
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,500
You don't know the explanation.

489
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,500
No, I'm just saying that I didn't pull the string.

490
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,500
You don't know about the end of the year.

491
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:03,500
If I didn't pull the string, would you talk about the end of the year?

492
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,500
No, I pulled it again.

493
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,500
It's stretched out.

494
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,500
No, it's not.

495
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:11,500
You're pulling too much.

496
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,500
I pulled out the yellow tape.

497
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:20,500
Why is the bath in the love hotel visible from the room?

498
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:23,500
Being visible means being seen.

499
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:26,500
Yes, that's right.

500
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,500
You don't like it, do you?

501
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:31,500
You don't want to be seen in the bath, do you?

502
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:32,500
Why?

503
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:35,500
It's not cool to be seen in the bath.

504
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:36,500
Is that so?

505
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:39,500
What are you doing in the bath?

506
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:47,500
I don't know about girls, but when men take a bath, their balls become like this.

507
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:53,500
When they see their balls become like this, they think it's the end of the year.

508
00:22:54,500 --> 00:23:00,500
When they see their balls become like this, they think it's the end of the year.

509
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:04,500
Is that what you think?

510
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,500
I understand.

511
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:19,500
But I don't like it very much.

512
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,500
You don't want to be seen in the bath.

513
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:25,500
And I don't like to take a bath with a woman.

514
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,500
Really?

515
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,500
I don't like it.

516
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:31,500
When I take a bath with a woman, I think it's the end of the year.

517
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,500
What do you mean by the end of the year?

518
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:43,500
When you take a bath with a woman, you think it's the end of the year.

519
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,500
It's the end of the year.

520
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:51,500
If that's the case, you're the one who is going to be seen in the bath.

521
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:54,500
That's a good point.

522
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:57,500
You're the one who is going to be seen in the bath.

523
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:58,500
That's right.

524
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,500
You're the one who is going to be seen in the bath.

525
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:03,500
That's right.
