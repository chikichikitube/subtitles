1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
This is the first time I've ever seen this kind of performance.

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Oh, you're still in good shape.

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Yes, I'm in good shape.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'm glad I stood up.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I'm glad I stood up and did the Guts pose.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I'm sure the people who are watching this will understand.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
There's no seats in the audience at all.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
This is the first time I've ever seen this kind of performance.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Thank you. I'll hit you later.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
The other day, we had a golf match.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I went to see it.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
You went to see it. Was it in the middle of the show?

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
That's right.

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
We did it.

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
We did it.

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I want you to see it today.

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I don't know the result until I see it.

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I dare not comment on anything.

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
If you want to say it, say it now.

20
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I think it's better to see it after listening to a lot of stories.

21
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
It's dirty.

22
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
This guy is really dirty.

23
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
That's all I'm going to say.

24
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Wait a minute.

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
What's so dirty about it?

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
It looks like I'm going to have a bad temper.

27
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
But...

28
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
This guy is so dirty.

29
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm going to play golf from now on.

30
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
When I'm scared, I'll do this.

31
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Don't do that.

32
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
That's not good.

33
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
That's because you told me first.

34
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I didn't say anything.

35
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
If you try to hit me like this, I'll hit you.

36
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Then I'll say, I don't want to hit you.

37
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
You've been saying it all the time.

38
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I don't want to hit you.

39
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I don't want to hit you.

40
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I don't want to hit you.

41
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
That's why you're doing it and I'm saying it.

42
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
That's all.

43
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
What's so dirty about it?

44
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I don't want to hit you.

45
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Is that true?

46
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
You said you didn't want to hit me first.

47
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
If you complain about that, you can't play golf.

48
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Let's watch the game.

49
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I'm sure there are various opinions.

50
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I'll ask you later.

51
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Please watch it.

52
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Umekichi is...

53
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Umekichi is a little...

54
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
It's the other way around.

55
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Umekichi.

56
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
This is the golf course.

57
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I'll be waiting for you.

58
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I'll be waiting for you.

59
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I don't usually use the key.

60
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
So I'll play a penalty game.

61
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Welcome.

62
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Golf match play.

63
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Let me explain the rules.

64
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
What is it?

65
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I'll do it five times.

66
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Okay.

67
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
The three I took earlier are hidden.

68
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
If you lose,

69
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
you have to go to the golf course.

70
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
And you have to wait in the dressing room.

71
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
So a professional will come to my house.

72
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Yes.

73
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Only two.

74
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Yes.

75
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
And I have to put it in the otaku's place.

76
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
You have to put it in?

77
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Yes.

78
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
So today,

79
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I've been staying in the parking lot all the time.

80
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Umekichi.

81
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
It's about time you got your name.

82
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Yes.

83
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Has Umekichi ever played golf?

84
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I've only seen it.

85
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
You've only seen it?

86
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Yes.

87
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I've never seen it.

88
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
You'll use Umekichi only once.

89
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
And you'll play until you hit the target.

90
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Until you hit the target.

91
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Until you hit the target.

92
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
How many times are you going to hit the target?

93
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
But Umekichi is not an ordinary old lady.

94
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I'm not an ordinary old lady.

95
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
You're not an ordinary old lady.

96
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
If you look closely, you'll see.

97
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Umekichi has a little beard.

98
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,000
That's how Umekichi is.

99
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Is this that?

100
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Really?

101
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I'll get a prize for this.

102
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Oh!

103
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Umekichi, you're really good.

104
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
What is that?

105
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
What is that?

106
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Hey, this is a serious sport.

107
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
You're going to miss.

108
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
You're going to miss.

109
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Oh!

110
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Here we go.

111
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I wanted to say this.

112
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Oh, it's out.

113
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Hey!

114
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Nice shot!

115
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
You're really good.

116
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
But this is going to be the seventh hit.

117
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
If it's the seventh hit, no one will notice.

118
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
No one will notice.

119
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Oh, no!

120
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Where did you hit it?

121
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Don't fall!

122
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
It fell!

123
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
You're really good.

124
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Umekichi.

125
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Yes?

126
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Mark it.

127
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Yes.

128
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
What?

129
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
You're going to hit a 10-yen coin?

130
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Hey!

131
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
You're the one who marked it.

132
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
It's a fox.

133
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
It's a fox.

134
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
It's over?

135
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
It's not working again.

136
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Oh, it went over there.

137
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
It's not going to work.

138
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Hey, Ita.

139
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Yes?

140
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I'm going to use a chance card here.

141
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I'm going to ask a professional.

142
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I'm going to ask a professional.

143
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I'm Go Meiges.

144
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I'm sorry that this kind of person is on our show.

145
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I'm really sorry.

146
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Then, in place of Machiko,

147
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Me?

148
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Yes.

149
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
It's sudden, but...

150
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Yes.

151
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
It's the red flag.

152
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I know!

153
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I know.

154
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Please don't sing this song.

155
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
It's easier to hit over there.

156
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
No, no, no.

157
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I don't need that kind of joke.

158
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Seriously.

159
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Please listen to Haritomo.

160
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Nice shot!

161
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
It's on, it's on, it's on.

162
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Oh, it's falling, it's falling.

163
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Oh, it's on.

164
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Nice shot!

165
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Thank you very much.

166
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Hey, did you all see that?

167
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Good, good, good.

168
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Should I run a little too much?

169
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
There are six of us.

170
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Three, four, five, six.

171
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Right?

172
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Right?

173
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
What do you know?

174
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Oh, this is a complicated course.

175
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
It's not easy.

176
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
You're the only one left.

177
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
You're the only one left.

178
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Stop blowing.

179
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Seriously.

180
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
That's really dirty.

181
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Yours is dirty.

182
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I'll do something about it.

183
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Demi, your blow is the most dirty.

184
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
No, you didn't cut it.

185
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Oh, it's on.

186
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Miracle shot.

187
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
It's on.

188
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

189
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Good, good, good.

190
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
That really hurt.

191
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
You're doing it on purpose.

192
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
What?

193
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
You hit it five times.

194
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I'll put this in.

195
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
What are you doing?

196
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Let's use Umekichi.

197
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Umekichi.

198
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
What kind of man are you?

199
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
You.

200
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
You were running happily.

201
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Please, please.

202
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Umekichi.

203
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Without this.

204
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I thought I had a bullet.

205
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
It's big.

206
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
It's big.

207
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I won't teach you.

208
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I won't teach you.

209
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I won't teach you.

210
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I won't teach you.

211
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I won't teach you.

212
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I won't teach you.

213
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I won't teach you.

214
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I won't teach you.

215
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I won't teach you.

216
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I won't teach you.

217
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I won't teach you.

218
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Take your time, Umekichi.

219
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Take your time.

220
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
How's your girlfriend doing?

221
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I don't care.

222
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I'll put this in either way.

223
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Oh, even?

224
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
This music...

225
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Oh, even?

226
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Oh, even?

227
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I left a good one.

228
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
This is difficult.

229
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
What if I put this in?

230
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Why?

231
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I can't put this in.

232
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I'm in trouble next time.

233
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Next.

234
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
That's it.

235
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
What?

236
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
That's it.

237
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
It's dirty.

238
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
You're still doing it?

239
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
You're persistent.

240
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
It's really dirty.

241
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
So, Matsumoto-kun.

242
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Penalty game.

243
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Why do I have to get a penalty?

244
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I just played golf.

245
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I'm having fun playing.

246
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Why do I have to get a penalty?

247
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Please go to Sanshi-san's place.

248
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Who's that?

249
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Katsura Sanshi-san.

250
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I don't know. I've seen him.

251
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
He's one of our seniors.

252
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
He's Katsura Sanshi's master.

253
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I don't know.

254
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Anyway, I'll get a penalty for Matsumoto-kun.

255
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Thank you very much.

256
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Thank you very much.

257
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I won't do it again.

258
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Thank you very much.

259
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I won't do it again.

260
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Thank you very much.

261
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I won't do it again.

262
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
It looks scary, doesn't it?

263
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
You saw it, didn't you?

264
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
It's dirty.

265
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
What's dirty?

266
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
This is my first time playing golf.

267
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I think I was pretty good.

268
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
You were pretty good.

269
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Umekichi...

270
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
What do you mean by Umekichi?

271
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
You're telling me too many details.

272
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
That's not true.

273
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
You're a pro.

274
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
You're telling me to do what I want to do.

275
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I was on the air for a while.

276
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
But before that, he was so annoying.

277
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Umekichi, do this, do that.

278
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
He kept making me do it.

279
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
There was a group of foreigners who were playing before me.

280
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
When the group of foreigners were playing,

281
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Umekichi said,

282
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I don't think that's right.

283
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
The foreigners were like,

284
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Hey, can I?

285
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
And they got angry.

286
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
They were so angry that

287
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
the foreigners started speaking Japanese.

288
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
The person I just introduced is

289
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
this person, right?

290
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
This is him.

291
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
This person is

292
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Mr. Asano Chisato.

293
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
He has a driver's license and...

294
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
What is this?

295
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
What is a first-class driver's license?

296
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
It's a normal driver's license.

297
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
A normal driver's license.

298
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Oh, I see.

299
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
It means you're in good health.

300
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Why are you taking it off all of a sudden?

301
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Just in case.

302
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
It's a matter of course.

303
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Is that so?

304
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I don't have any intentions.

305
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I like sports and swimming.

306
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Thank you very much.

307
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Are you going to take it home?

308
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Thank you very much.

309
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Goodbye.

310
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
The other day, I was wiping the blackboard,

311
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
and my nails hit the blackboard,

312
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
and it made a noise,

313
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
and everyone told me to die.

314
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I don't hate it,

315
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
but why do you hate that sound so much?

316
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Do you hate this sound?

317
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
By the way, what I hate is

318
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
when I put a spoon on my teeth.

319
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
It hits, but you don't hate it, do you?

320
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
When you drink something,

321
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
you sometimes say,

322
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Oh, you don't like it?

323
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
No, I don't hate the sound of the blackboard.

324
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Why do you hate it?

325
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I don't hate it.

326
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
No way.

327
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
And your blood vessels are also painful, aren't they?

328
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
What?

329
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Blood vessels, blood vessels.

330
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
What does that mean?

331
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
There are many things that humans can't stand.

332
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
If you put ice here, it will be terrible.

333
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
So why do you do that?

334
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Why do you put ice here in your normal life?

335
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
What?

336
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
What?

337
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
What?

338
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
What?

339
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
So why do you put it here?

340
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
There are many reasons to put ice here.

341
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Why do you put ice here?

342
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
What?

343
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Don't ask me again.

344
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Why do you put it here?

345
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Putting ice here is a daily routine.

346
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Absolutely.

347
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Hello, I'm Sahanji, a daily person.

348
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
You know...

349
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
What?

350
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
What?

351
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
What do you do to put ice here?

352
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
No, no.

353
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I was just making a joke.

354
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I was just making a joke.

355
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Oh, I see.

356
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I'm a girl who loves you, Hama-chan.

357
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I have a problem.

358
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I have the same problem as you.

359
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I have the same problem as you.

360
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I have the same problem as you.

361
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I have the same problem as you.

362
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:35,000
This guy is the only one who says it stinks.

363
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Have you ever smelled my room?

364
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
This guy...

365
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
What?

366
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
What?

367
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I'm the only one who says it?

368
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
That's right.

369
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
You're the only one who says it.

370
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
What are you saying?

371
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I'm lying, but I'm saying it.

372
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
You're the only one who says it.

373
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Other people say it stinks.

374
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I'm used to it now.

375
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
When I smelled your room for the first time,

376
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I thought there was poop on my nose.

377
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I thought it was strange.

378
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
You didn't feel that the smell was close to you?

379
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
It smelled so close to me.

380
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I'm so busy with my nose hair.

381
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
What's wrong with your nose hair?

382
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
What's wrong with your nose hair?

383
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Something I've never been in before is trying to get through.

384
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
My nose hair is all over the place.

385
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
That's amazing.

386
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
It's all over the place.

387
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
It's all over the place.

388
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
It's all over the place.

389
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
That's amazing.

390
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Seriously.

391
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
That's right.

392
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
How many times have I said it stinks?

393
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Foreigners can't speak Japanese at all.

394
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
It's the same as before.

395
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
When I smelled your room for the first time,

396
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I thought it smelled so close to me.

397
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
That's your instinct.

398
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
My instinct.

399
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
You thought it smelled so close to you.

400
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
That's right.

401
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
I've never spoken to a child before.

402
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I've never been born.

403
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
I've never been a mother or a mother.

404
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I thought it smelled so close to me.

405
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
That's about it.

406
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
But I understand how you feel.

407
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
That's enough.

408
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
In the end, when something happens,

409
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
you'll show your bad temper.

410
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
For example?

411
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
For example, your grandmother is in trouble at the traffic light.

412
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
She can't cross the street.

413
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
You'll look at that and pretend not to see it, right?

414
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Not at all.

415
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
What will you do?

416
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I'll pull her hand.

417
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
You'll never do that.

418
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
You'll never do that.

419
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I'll do it.

420
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
What?

421
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
What are you going to do?

422
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
What do you mean?

423
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
What are you going to do?

424
00:18:49,000 --> 00:19:15,860
nei

425
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
What will you do?

426
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
You're telling me this.

427
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
What will you do if your grandmother is there?

428
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
What do you do if your grandmother is there?

429
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
What do I do?

430
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
What will you do?

431
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
What will you do if your grandmother is there?

432
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
If the traffic light doesn't come through?

433
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
What will you do?

434
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
If the traffic light doesn't come through,

435
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I don't know

436
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
You said that

437
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
What did I say?

438
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
You said that

439
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
The traffic light is blue

440
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
You said that

441
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
That's why the traffic light is blue

442
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
You said that so I'm going home

443
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I'm going home

444
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I'm going home

445
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
It's a normal road

446
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Sometimes the car goes like this

447
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
If you look at it like this

448
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
There's an old lady

449
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I can't go

450
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
What if there's an old lady like that?

451
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,000
But there's no old lady trying to cross that road

452
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I don't think there will be

453
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
You're so stubborn

454
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I want to cross

455
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
No matter what

456
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
There's always something

457
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Old ladies have a strong faith so it's okay

458
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
What do you mean by faith?

459
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
They have a lot of protection

460
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
That has nothing to do with it

461
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
What if there's an old lady in trouble?

462
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
What are you talking about?

463
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
What trouble are you talking about?

464
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
The stairs to the church are long

465
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
They're long

466
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
If you're young you can go up

467
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
But the old ladies

468
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
One by one

469
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
You can't go like this

470
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
You have to wear kimono

471
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
You have to wear kimono

472
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
You have to go up

473
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
What if there's an old lady like that?

474
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
An old lady like that?

475
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
The stairs

476
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
But you can go up

477
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
I don't have any luggage

478
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
I forgot

479
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
I have luggage

480
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
One by one

481
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
How old are you?

482
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
I'm close to 70

483
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
60 something

484
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
When I say old ladies

485
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
I start from 75

486
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Sorry I forgot

487
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I forgot

488
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
75 old ladies

489
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Stubborn old ladies

490
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Stubborn old ladies

491
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Stubborn old ladies

492
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Genki

493
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Genki

494
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
It's like someone's comedy

495
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
What if there's an old lady like that?

496
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
What if there's an old lady like that?

497
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
What are you going to do?

498
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
It's dirty

499
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
What's dirty?

500
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
What are you going to do when there's an old lady like that?

501
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
I'll help you

502
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
How?

503
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
I'll do this

504
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
What is this?

505
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I'll hold the old lady

506
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I'll hold her

507
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
I'll definitely do it

508
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
I'll do it

509
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
When I'm walking down the street

510
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
The old lady will say

511
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
My stomach hurts

512
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
My stomach hurts

513
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I'm scared so I'll go

514
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
The game is over

515
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
It's time for the punishment

516
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
The punishment

517
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
This year

518
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
We can show it to everyone

519
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
And

520
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
In front of our school

521
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
We're doing

522
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
We're doing

523
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
That show

524
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
We're doing

525
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
We're doing

526
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
We're doing

527
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
A special show

528
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
We're doing

529
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
This is December 29th

530
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Saturday from 2 to 3

531
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Until the 25th

532
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
We're doing a special show

533
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
It's fun

534
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
If we win

535
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
We'll do a punishment game

536
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
If we win

537
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
We'll do

538
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Dance, dance, dance

539
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
That's good

540
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Let's do it

541
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
So for us

542
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
We'll go

543
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
This is

544
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
The first event

545
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Please do your best

546
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Please look forward to it

547
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Let's do it

548
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
This program was sponsored by

549
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:50,000
