00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:24,000
This program is brought to you by the following sponsors.

2
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Excuse me.

3
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Here you are.

4
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Excuse me.

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Excuse me.

6
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Here you are.

7
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
All right.

8
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
It was hard, wasn't it?

9
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
All right.

10
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
It was hard, wasn't it?

11
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Hamada?

12
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Mr. Hamada.

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
What?

14
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Why suddenly?

15
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
It was hard.

16
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Well, I was pretty bad.

17
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
When you were a student?

18
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I was boxing.

19
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
What?

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Is it your first time?

21
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Yes.

22
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I started to like boxing.

23
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
What?

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Is it your first time?

25
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
That's amazing.

26
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
You've been boxing for a long time, haven't you?

27
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Is it your first time?

28
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
That's right.

29
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I started to like boxing.

30
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
But I didn't practice properly.

31
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
You didn't?

32
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I didn't.

33
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I see.

34
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Well, I hit my body.

35
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
You hit your body?

36
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I hit my body.

37
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
You hit your body?

38
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I hit my body during practice.

39
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
You hit your body during practice.

40
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
My grandfather said,

41
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Hit your body.

42
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I don't understand it at all.

43
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Who is your grandfather?

44
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I don't understand it at all.

45
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
My opponent was strong.

46
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I hit him a lot.

47
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I hit him a lot.

48
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I hit him a lot.

49
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Who did you hit?

50
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
The champion.

51
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
The champion?

52
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Did you go that far?

53
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Is it a world championship?

54
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
What?

55
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Is the champion different?

56
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
It's different.

57
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
It's different.

58
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I don't know.

59
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
The champion.

60
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
He was very strong.

61
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I was beaten up.

62
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
What happened?

63
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Did I lose?

64
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I don't know.

65
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Did I lose?

66
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I don't know.

67
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I don't know.

68
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I was beaten up.

69
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I don't know.

70
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I remember you were saying,

71
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Adrian!

72
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
After the game.

73
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
What?

74
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
What is that?

75
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
What's his name?

76
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
At that time,

77
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
You were in the show.

78
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
That's right.

79
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
What is Adrian?

80
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
What is Adrian?

81
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
What do you mean?

82
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
What is Adrian?

83
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
This is the first time I've heard of it.

84
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I don't want to do it anymore.

85
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
You've already quit?

86
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Just once?

87
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
No, no, I don't want to talk about this anymore.

88
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I see.

89
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
It was hard. I didn't think I'd be talking about this.

90
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
There's a lot of things we don't know.

91
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
We've never heard of it before.

92
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
That's true.

93
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Please, I'm begging you.

94
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I don't want to talk about this anymore.

95
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Are you ready?

96
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Yes.

97
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Ready, set, go.

98
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Thank goodness.

99
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
What's wrong?

100
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Was it hard?

101
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
It was.

102
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
There's one thing I don't want to talk about.

103
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Really?

104
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Yes.

105
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I've already said it, so you should say it too.

106
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I don't think you'll believe me, but please listen to half of what I have to say.

107
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
No, no, no.

108
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I'll listen.

109
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I believe you.

110
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I believe what Endo has to say.

111
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I believe you.

112
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I believe you.

113
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
About being bullied by a monkey.

114
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
What?

115
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
You were bullied by a monkey?

116
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
What do you mean?

117
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I don't know.

118
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I believe you, but...

119
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I had to jump out of the earth.

120
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Jump out of the earth?

121
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:02,000
It's really sudden, but the spaceship broke down on the way.

122
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
The spaceship you're on?

123
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
The spaceship I'm on.

124
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Why?

125
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
There was an engine trouble or something.

126
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
That's amazing.

127
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
That's amazing.

128
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
You were saved?

129
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Yes.

130
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
It started from here.

131
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I jumped out of the earth.

132
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
That's amazing.

133
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
That's where the monkey bullying started.

134
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
What do you mean?

135
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I don't know.

136
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I don't know.

137
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Why?

138
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I don't know.

139
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I don't know.

140
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
That's where the monkey bullying started.

141
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Why can't I be bullied by a monkey?

142
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I don't think you'll believe me, but humans control the earth.

143
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
The monkeys control the earth.

144
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Really?

145
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:50,000
There was a goddess of freedom.

146
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
In America?

147
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Yes.

148
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
There was the earth here.

149
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
That's what I felt.

150
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
There are so many things.

151
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
It was normal.

152
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
It was good that you came back.

153
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Thank you.

154
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
What do you mean?

155
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
There are a lot of things I don't understand.

156
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
But it's hard to remember the old days.

157
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
That's right.

158
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
It's a short story.

159
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
That's right.

160
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Cheers.

161
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
You're not talking.

162
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Cheers.

163
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Cheers.

164
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I'm not going to say it now.

165
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I'm Joe.

166
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
What?

167
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
What?

168
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
That's it?

169
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
That's it?

170
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I heard you were boxing.

171
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Yes.

172
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I used to do it, too.

173
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Really?

174
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Really?

175
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I don't want to say it.

176
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Why?

177
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
What made you do it?

178
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
An old man...

179
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Well, how should I put it?

180
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
He had an iPad.

181
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
He said, you're an artist.

182
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
You should come to the match.

183
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I was surprised.

184
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Really?

185
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I was happy.

186
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I went to the match.

187
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
There was a girl.

188
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I wonder if there was a girl.

189
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
What are you talking about?

190
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

191
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
It's an old story.

192
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I'm not talking about a girl.

193
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
You're talking about Morimaru.

194
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I'm not talking about a girl.

195
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
My opponent was a foreigner.

196
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
He was a hose mendoza.

197
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
He was the last one.

198
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
He was in front of me.

199
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I was shouting.

200
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
His iPad said,

201
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Stand up.

202
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Stand up.

203
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I was sitting.

204
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I was dancing.

205
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Stand up.

206
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Yes.

207
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Yes.

208
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I did my best.

209
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I died at the end.

210
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
What do you mean by that?

211
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
As a boxer.

212
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
As a boxer.

213
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I died at the end.

214
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I turned white.

215
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
What happened?

216
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
He was very angry.

217
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I didn't want to remember it.

218
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
What happened to you today?

219
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
It was a long time ago.

220
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I remember it.

221
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I love you.

222
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I love you.

223
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I love you.

224
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I love you.

225
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I want to hear your story.

226
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Yes.

227
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
You've been through a lot of things.

228
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I heard that you don't have a voice.

229
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I've never heard of you when you were a kid.

230
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I've never heard of you.

231
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
When I was a kid,

232
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I was taken to a temple.

233
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Because you were a bad kid.

234
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
The big guy at the time was a bad guy.

235
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I don't understand at all.

236
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
The big guy at the time was a bad guy.

237
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Who?

238
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I don't understand at all.

239
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
When you were a kid.

240
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
When you were a kid.

241
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I don't understand at all.

242
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
There's a bridge.

243
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
A bridge.

244
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
A bridge.

245
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
A bridge.

246
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Yes.

247
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
At the bridge.

248
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
There's a sign that says,

249
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Don't cross this bridge.

250
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
There's a sign that says,

251
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Don't cross this bridge.

252
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I don't like it.

253
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I don't like it.

254
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
But you did cross it.

255
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I don't like it.

256
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
But you did cross it.

257
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I don't like it.

258
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
There's a sign that says,

259
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Don't cross this bridge.

260
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
But you did cross it.

261
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I don't like it.

262
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I was walking in the middle of the bridge.

263
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I understood the message I was trying to say.

264
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
When I was a kid,

265
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I was a tough guy.

266
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
A little bit.

267
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
A little bit.

268
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
A little bit.

269
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I had a hard time.

270
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I did it quite often.

271
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
You did.

272
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I did.

273
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
It was hard.

274
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
No, but if you listen to the old stories, it's fun.

275
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
So that's how it was.

276
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Well, well.

277
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I don't know if you hated it or not.

278
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I'll just say something.

279
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
On the contrary.

280
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
It's a lie.

281
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
It's okay.

282
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
My memories.

283
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Why?

284
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I can't do it.

285
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
It's not easy.

286
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
You know what?

287
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I was wearing an ice hockey mask.

288
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Who?

289
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Me, me, me.

290
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
When you were a kid?

291
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
No, not when I was a kid.

292
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Recently.

293
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Recently?

294
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Why?

295
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
What are you talking about?

296
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
What are you talking about?

297
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I was so excited.

298
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I was wearing an ice hockey mask.

299
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
And I was killing people with a sickle.

300
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Why?

301
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
You can't get tired of that.

302
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
You can't get tired of that.

303
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Who?

304
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
People who were already there, people who were coming to stay.

305
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Where?

306
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Where?

307
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:22,000
It was last month, or actually, Friday the 13th.

308
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Were you doing it?

309
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Friday the 13th.

310
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Scary.

311
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I'm scared.

312
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I was definitely coming to stay.

313
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I don't like it at all.

314
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
It's scary.

315
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
It's really scary.

316
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Tanaka, have you ever told me that you're not interested in baseball?

317
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
That's right.

318
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
What do you mean?

319
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
When it comes to baseball, there's something like Endo.

320
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I've never heard of it.

321
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Endo has a strong image of baseball, so it's hard to say that he was hiding it.

322
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I know, I know.

323
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:12,000
My dad really loves baseball.

324
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
It's Sparta.

325
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I don't like it anymore.

326
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I'll tell you.

327
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
When I told him, he turned the table over.

328
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
He's a scary old man.

329
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
He said, I'm scared.

330
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
What did he say?

331
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
It's a spring.

332
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
A spring?

333
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
He had a spring attached to his whole body.

334
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Why?

335
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
So that he could throw a fast ball.

336
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I see.

337
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:48,000
He said something like, put on your hand and do it.

338
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
What?

339
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
You can't say that.

340
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
He didn't say anything.

341
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
My sister was worried about me.

342
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
But she just looked at me.

343
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
She didn't say anything?

344
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
She didn't say anything.

345
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
She's a weak sister.

346
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
She said no.

347
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
And then I joined the Giants.

348
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
What?

349
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Really?

350
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
That's amazing.

351
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I don't know much about it.

352
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I didn't know at all.

353
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
There was a result of training.

354
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
He threw a fast ball.

355
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
A fast ball?

356
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
A fast ball that disappeared.

357
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Disappeared?

358
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
What disappeared?

359
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
It just disappeared.

360
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
It just disappeared.

361
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Everyone, like Bang-kun.

362
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Who is Bang-kun?

363
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
He's a catcher.

364
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
He's a catcher.

365
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Hanagata.

366
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Who is Hanagata?

367
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Who?

368
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
He was in the Tigers draft.

369
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I didn't know that.

370
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
You should have seen him.

371
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I didn't know.

372
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
He had bangs.

373
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Bangs?

374
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Bangs?

375
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Bangs.

376
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Bangs.

377
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
He had bangs.

378
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
How did the ball disappear?

379
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
He spread his arms.

380
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
He put his hands on it.

381
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
He jumped.

382
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
That was Bang-ba-bang.

383
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
That's not right.

384
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I heard it for the first time.

385
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
If I had a chance.

386
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I want to hear it again.

387
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I want to hear it again.

388
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
You want to hear it again?

389
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I want to hear it again.

390
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Matsumoto-san.

391
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
How was it?

392
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,000
When you were young.

393
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Well.

394
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
This story.

395
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I don't know if it's a story on TV.

396
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Please let us hear it.

397
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
That's right.

398
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Well.

399
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I was born in a hospital.

400
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I wasn't born in Samba-san.

401
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
You were born at home?

402
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Well, I was born at home.

403
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I'm still Teio Sekkai.

404
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
But I was born in Araimo.

405
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I was more Arai Teio Sekkai.

406
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I was very Arai.

407
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
You were more Arai Teio Sekkai.

408
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Was it like that?

409
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I don't believe it.

410
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I believe in all kinds of memories.

411
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Well.

412
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I was protected by something like a fruit.

413
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
What were you protecting?

414
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I don't know.

415
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
What are you saying?

416
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I don't know.

417
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
To put it simply.

418
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
It was like an abandoned child.

419
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I was put in a fruit-like thing.

420
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I was washed away by the river.

421
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I thought it was a terrible parent.

422
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,000
My grandmother picked it up in the red valley.

423
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Now that I think about it.

424
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I think it's a bad thing.

425
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I lived with my grandfather.

426
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
What was my grandmother doing?

427
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
She was washing clothes in the river.

428
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,000
When I think about it, it's like being homeless.

429
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Well.

430
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I think so.

431
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
On the contrary.

432
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:39,000
After all, it's hard to be a fan of the old days.

433
00:17:39,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Gaki Gaki-kun Gaki Gaki-kun Gaki Gaki-kun Gaki Gaki-kun Gari Gari-kun

434
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,000
I don't have anything to say.

435
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Mr. Tama has made it clear that he will be punished.

436
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
The staff is still laughing.

437
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Really?

438
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I think it will start soon.

439
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
What are you doing?

440
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Well.

441
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Please go on a trip for a while.

442
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I'm sorry.

443
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
I'm sorry.

444
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I'll apologize twice.

445
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I don't know much about the trip.

446
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I'll be back in February.

447
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
It's okay.

448
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
No, no, no.

449
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I'm not a radio station.

450
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
You've been talking for so long.

451
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
It's okay.

452
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I'm really sorry.

453
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I'll apologize three times.

454
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I've always wanted to say this.

455
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
If there's a good place.

456
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I always forgot something.

457
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I see.

458
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I remembered today.

459
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Please say it.

460
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
There's something I'm angry about.

461
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Please.

462
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
For example, when you want to find out the number of the store.

463
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Yes.

464
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
You call.

465
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Yes.

466
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
For example.

467
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Yes.

468
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I'm looking for it myself.

469
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Well, you're looking for it yourself.

470
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Oh, that's fine.

471
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Yes, yes, yes.

472
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Do you know how much it costs?

473
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Of course.

474
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
This.

475
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Surprisingly, everyone doesn't know.

476
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Yes.

477
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
It costs 150 yen.

478
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Everyone has to be more angry about this.

479
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
To that old woman.

480
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
What's your voice?

481
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
And this is a machine.

482
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,000
It costs 150 yen.

483
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Did you know?

484
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Yes, yes, yes.

485
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Most people don't know.

486
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Yes, yes.

487
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
You didn't know, did you?

488
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
If you ask twice, it's 300 yen.

489
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
If you ask three times, it's 450 yen.

490
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
It's a bye-bye game.

491
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I'm crying at the bye-bye game.

492
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I think so.

493
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Yes.

494
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
You've been in downtown for more than 20 years.

495
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Yes.

496
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Right?

497
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Yes.

498
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:15,000
You've been hitting my head 40,000 times.

499
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Well, I don't know.

500
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I'm going to take 150 yen from you next year.

501
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
I'm sorry.

502
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
It's a bad story.

503
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
150 yen.

504
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Yes.

505
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
150 yen.

506
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I think I can take it.

507
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Why?

508
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
This is obviously an obstacle.

509
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Because you hit me?

510
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Well, the taste is a little...

511
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
You're lying.

512
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
That's not true.

513
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:52,000
I know it's sweet and sour, but it's sweet and sour.

514
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
You don't have to know that much.

515
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Sweet and sour is important.

516
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
You don't have to know that much.

517
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Sweet and sour is important.

518
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Sweet.

519
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Sour.

520
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
I don't know.

521
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
I don't care.

522
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I don't care at all.

523
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
You don't have to eat that much.

524
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
It's sweet and sour.

525
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,000
I don't eat that much.

526
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
I don't eat that much.

527
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I don't eat that much.

528
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Rather than that...

529
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:37,000
It's better to say that 150 yen is strange.

530
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,000
150 yen is amazing.

531
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I don't think so.

532
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
This is all I have.

533
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Why does it take so much money just to tell me your phone number?

534
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
It's impossible.

535
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:54,000
I wonder if you can't do that in the second half of the show.

536
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
What do you mean? I don't understand.

537
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Ask the old lady and tell her to wait a moment.

538
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Wait a moment?

539
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
In the second half...

540
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
It changes to tape, right?

541
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
It changes.

542
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
It's not tape, is it?

543
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
It's not tape.

544
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
It's not tape?

545
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
It's not tape.

546
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,000
It's more like a computer.

547
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Ask her to wait a moment.

548
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:32,000
You're recording right now.

549
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
That's strange.

550
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
That's strange.

551
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
It's not tape.

552
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
It's connected to a line.

553
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,000
It's connected to something.

554
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
When a voice comes out, it's connected to a line.

555
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
When I press the button, a voice comes out.

556
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
What are you imagining?

557
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,000
There's something like Naniku's food.

558
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
I wonder if there is.

559
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
There's something like that.

560
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
What?

561
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
That's amazing.

562
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:06,000
That's amazing.

563
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
What are you doing?

564
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
It's like a stick.

565
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
When I press the button...

566
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
What's going on?

567
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
That's amazing.

568
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:21,000
It's like a stick.

569
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Are you okay?

570
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
You have plenty of time.

571
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
I'm not saying that.

572
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I'm just asking if it's okay to use tape from the beginning.

573
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
If I say it simply.

574
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:35,000
There's no tape at the beginning.

575
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
What is it?

576
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Tape, tape.

577
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
It's like you're stuck.

578
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
I'm saying tape.

579
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
What is tape?

580
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Shut up.

581
00:23:44,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Yes, 150 yen.
