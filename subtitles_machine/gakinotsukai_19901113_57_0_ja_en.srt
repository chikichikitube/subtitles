1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Good morning!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Good morning!

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Good morning!

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Ah, good morning!

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Today is going to be tough!

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
What do you mean?

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
No, really, today is going to be tough.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Yes!

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Today is going to be a little different than usual.

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
That's right.

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
We're going to have everyone watch a lot of VTRs.

12
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
The other day, you know, you dressed up like a blonde,

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
and came to the riverbed of Arakawa.

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Yes.

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Did anyone of you come here?

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Yes!

17
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
That's all?

18
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
What about the others?

19
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I've said this before on the show,

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
most of them raised their hands, right?

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
But when I opened the lid, it was like this.

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
It's like this.

23
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
They're really cold, aren't they?

24
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
That's all?

25
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
What were the others doing?

26
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
They were taking a break.

27
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
They were playing somewhere.

28
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Ah, good morning!

29
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And the weather was nice that day.

30
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
The weather was nice!

31
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
If you go to a place like that,

32
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
it's not the time for blondes to be doing this.

33
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
But it's fine!

34
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Let's all have fun!

35
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Why aren't you coming?

36
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Blondes...

37
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
No one's dressed up like a blonde.

38
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Well, well, how do you say this?

39
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The non-citizens are the non-citizens.

40
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
This...

41
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
All of a sudden?

42
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
What is it?

43
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
There were a lot of non-citizens.

44
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
There were a lot on that day!

45
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Today, we'll show you a lot of that.

46
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
We'll show you a part of it.

47
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Let's eat.

48
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Here you go.

49
00:01:40,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Non-citizens!

50
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Non-citizens!

51
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Non-citizens!

52
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Let's all give them a round of applause!

53
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Non-citizens!

54
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Non-citizens!

55
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Hello!

56
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Let's all give them a round of applause!

57
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Well, let's take a look.

58
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I'll say one thing.

59
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
You, red wig, go home.

60
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
You're not allowed.

61
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Okay?

62
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I'm aiming at the camera from above.

63
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
If you look at the air, you can see everyone.

64
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I don't know if you can see it, though.

65
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Are you ready?

66
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Ready, start!

67
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I'll say it.

68
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
After that, Masato-kun.

69
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
2 years and 4 groups?

70
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
2 years and 4 groups.

71
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
3 years and 4 groups.

72
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:00,000
4 years and 4 groups.

73
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
3 years and 4 groups.

74
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I don't know where you're going.

75
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Behind you!

76
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Wait a minute.

77
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I'm waiting for the train.

78
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,000
4 years and 4 groups.

79
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:40,000
3 years and 4 groups.

80
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Okay!

81
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Okay, but wait a minute.

82
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I'll check.

83
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Okay, okay, okay.

84
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Let's go!

85
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:06,000
3 years and 4 groups.

86
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:18,000
This is funny.

87
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:47,000
3 years and 4 groups.

88
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:59,000
3 years and 4 groups.

89
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:28,000
3 years and 4 groups.

90
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:39,000
3 years and 4 groups.

91
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:52,000
3 years and 4 groups.

92
00:07:52,000 --> 00:08:02,000
3 years and 4 groups.

93
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:15,000
3 years and 4 groups.

94
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:25,000
3 years and 4 groups.

95
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:38,000
3 years and 4 groups.

96
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,000
3 years and 4 groups.

97
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:58,000
3 years and 4 groups.

98
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Now I'm going to do a one-word practice.

99
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Are you ready?

100
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I'm going to do a one-word practice as a kid.

101
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I'm going to do a one-word practice as a kid.

102
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:27,000
First of all, I'm going to give you a white towel.

103
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:36,000
And then I'm going to take off my jacket.

104
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I didn't say I'd be naked.

105
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I'm going to take off my jacket.

106
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
What do you call it?

107
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
A rectangle.

108
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
At the end, we'll go down.

109
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I'd like you to give me some space.

110
00:09:52,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Something's shaking.

111
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,000
It's shaking, isn't it?

112
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I'm scared.

113
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:29,000
We're going to combine the back and front.

114
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I don't need it.

115
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Everyone, hold the camera tight.

116
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:54,000
One, two, three.

117
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
It's okay.

118
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Let's do it one more time.

119
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Let's do it a little longer.

120
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:11,000
One, two, three.

121
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Okay.

122
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Please take a picture of me.

123
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I won't do it many times.

124
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I'm going to do a manzai pose.

125
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I'm going to do a manzai pose.

126
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I'm going to do it.

127
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:41,000
One, two.

128
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I'm going to do a manzai pose.

129
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
One, two.

130
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Are you shooting?

131
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I'm going to do it.

132
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I'm going to do it.

133
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I'm going to do it.

134
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I'm going to do it.

135
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
1, 2, 3, 4!

136
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I never thought that we would gather this many people in this costume.

137
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I'm surprised.

138
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Thank you very much everyone.

139
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I think that we will be able to gather this many people when we do something.

140
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
We are also feeling less confident.

141
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
So, let's go!

142
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Let's go!

143
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Louder!

144
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
This is the last one!

145
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
What?

146
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Do you want to do the third person?

147
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Yes!

148
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Everyone, move your body.

149
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I will say the last one.

150
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Coming, right?

151
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Everyone, do you want to do the third person?

152
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I don't know.

153
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Mr. Matsumoto, please sing the lyrics.

154
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Yes.

155
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Please sing it as it is.

156
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Yes.

157
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Move your body to the right and left.

158
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Let's go!

159
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
The one who takes away the green earth.

160
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,000
The one who takes away the green earth.

161
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,000
The one who takes away the green earth.

162
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:48,000
But there is no one who can take away the green earth as much as I do.

163
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,000
The one who takes away the green earth.

164
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:58,000
The one who takes away the green earth.

165
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:10,000
The one who takes away the green earth.

166
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:30,000
But there is no one who can take away the green earth as much as I do.

167
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Everyone, thank you very much!

168
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Mr. Matsumoto, I was impressed this time too.

169
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I made it like that at the end.

170
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
It was wonderful.

171
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
If you gather this much.

172
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:53,000
If you gather this much, I can't make a house.

173
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:58,000
We have to make a new development from next month.

174
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
We don't have a break.

175
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
What is waiting for us next?

176
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:08,000
We have to play a game of golf.

177
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,000
We talked about playing a game of golf.

178
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Do you want to play it?

179
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
No, I'm fine.

180
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I have one thing to say.

181
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
We played it as a punishment game.

182
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Can you change your mind this time?

183
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
You're saying something nice.

184
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:34,000
You can make the winner's wish come true.

185
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I don't understand what you're saying.

186
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I heard it once.

187
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
How about this?

188
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
There is a pressure that you can't lose because you have this.

189
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
But you want to win because you have this.

190
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
That kind of...

191
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Wait, wait.

192
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
What is it?

193
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
What is it?

194
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
No matter what the winner says, you have to do it.

195
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
That's right.

196
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
No matter what he says.

197
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
You can't do that.

198
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
No matter what he says.

199
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
When you lose, you can't say this or that.

200
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
You can't do that.

201
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:12,000
We played the punishment game three times and went skydiving.

202
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I thought there was nothing more.

203
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I thought so, too.

204
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
That's why I quit the punishment game.

205
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
There was one.

206
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Something similar to that.

207
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
What is it?

208
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
What is it?

209
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Bungee jump.

210
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Bungee jump...

211
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
It's like a chimpanzee chop.

212
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Chimpanzee...

213
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Sorry.

214
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I was looking at you chopping a chimpanzee from the side.

215
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
What makes me happy?

216
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
What?

217
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
You should have just chopped it.

218
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
If I win...

219
00:17:53,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I want you to skydive as a couple.

220
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Wait a minute.

221
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Wait.

222
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Hey, wait.

223
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
What are you thinking?

224
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
It's high.

225
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I can't do it today.

226
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Or you can ride a bike and go around Suzuka together.

227
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,000
When you turn, it's like this.

228
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
How about this?

229
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
It's easy to ride on the other side.

230
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:38,000
If you fall, your bones will be broken.

231
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
How about this?

232
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
You...

233
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Wait a minute.

234
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,000
You should have done something more exciting.

235
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Like kangaroo boxing.

236
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
You can laugh.

237
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
You can't laugh.

238
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I thought you were chopping a monkey.

239
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I can't do it.

240
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
It's a punishment game.

241
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,000
You should have done something more exciting.

242
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Let's get back to the topic.

243
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
What do you mean?

244
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Let's start with golf.

245
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Otherwise, you'll lose.

246
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I'm not confident.

247
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Give me a handicap.

248
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I'm thinking about it.

249
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I didn't want to win.

250
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I'm thinking about a chance card.

251
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:38,000
If I don't win, I'll get a chance card.

252
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I'm thinking about a good person.

253
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Who is a good person?

254
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
A professional.

255
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I don't want to be a professional.

256
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I'm going to give up my head.

257
00:19:53,000 --> 00:20:00,000
If I give up my head, I can't communicate.

258
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Please.

259
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I don't want to be a professional.

260
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Please.

261
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
I don't want to be a professional.

262
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
You're just talking to people.

263
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Please say it.

264
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I'll listen to you.

265
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
What is it?

266
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I'll lose.

267
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
You'll do anything.

268
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:32,000
It's a penalty game.

269
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,000
What is it?

270
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,000
An air swing.

271
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
An air swing.

272
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
It's okay.

273
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:48,000
What?

274
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
I'll do anything.

275
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
If I lose?

276
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I'll do an air swing, too.

277
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
If we both lose, we'll do an air swing.

278
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Why did you do an air swing?

279
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
There's a net underneath.

280
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,000
I couldn't shape it for a week.

281
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
It's a net.

282
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
It's a net.

283
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
It's a net.

284
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
If you walk on the street like that, there's no difference from a mackerel.

285
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
What?

286
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
I'll do it again.

287
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I can't do that.

288
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Do you want a penalty game?

289
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Rather than a penalty game, I'd like to think about golf again.

290
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Let's think about it.

291
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Let's think about it.

292
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I don't have time to think about it.

293
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:50,000
I don't have time to think about it.

294
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Do you have music to go home?

295
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,000
If you have music, we'll be sorry.

296
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Please come to play again.

297
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Thank you.

298
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Thank you very much.

299
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
I'm tired.

300
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Seriously.

301
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:27,000
The penalty game hasn't been decided yet.

302
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,000
The content of the game hasn't been decided yet.

303
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Let's play a game of shooting.

304
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
What?

305
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Let's be friends.

306
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
I don't like shooting.

307
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
What is it?

308
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
I don't like shooting.

309
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Let's play a game of shooting.

310
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
You don't have to worry about it.

311
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I don't like it.

312
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
How about a game of golf?

313
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I can't allow it.

314
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
I was surprised.

315
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
I was surprised.

316
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Let's play a game of shooting.

317
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Thank you very much.
