1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The next day

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The next day

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The next day

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Can you film?

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
No

6
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
What about the video?

7
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I can't film the video

8
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
You can't film the video?

9
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Yes

10
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Oh, I see

11
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Good morning

12
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Good morning

13
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Good morning

14
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
What's wrong?

15
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
You're panting

16
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
What's wrong?

17
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm tired

18
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
What?

19
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Who are you talking to?

20
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The police

21
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
What?

22
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
What?

23
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
No way

24
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
The police

25
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
They wouldn't do that

26
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
No, they would do something

27
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Right?

28
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
They would do something

29
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
No way

30
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
The police are really angry today

31
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Why?

32
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Now that I think about it, I feel sorry for them

33
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
How many years have you been in this show?

34
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
15 years

35
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
How many times have you done this show in 15 years?

36
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Quite a lot

37
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Have you ever filmed the police in a cool way?

38
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
If you say so

39
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Have you ever filmed the police in a 180-degree angle?

40
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
No, I've never done that

41
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
No, no

42
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I've done a lot of things that made me the main character

43
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Yes

44
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I've done a lot of things that made me the main character

45
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Right?

46
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Are you not satisfied with that?

47
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I'm not satisfied

48
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I heard that only this year, the number of ENDERs has decreased by 6

49
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
But that's the last time

50
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I've only done it 5 times, but the number of ENDERs has decreased by 6

51
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
In the end, what's the problem?

52
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
That's right

53
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
What's wrong with us?

54
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
That's why I want you to show us something cool on this show

55
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I want you to show us that there's nothing cool about you

56
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
It's difficult

57
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
It's difficult

58
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Even a little thing can be scary

59
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
That's right

60
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Even if you do it

61
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Suwa-chan, you don't have to do it

62
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I don't think so

63
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Right?

64
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
It's getting worse

65
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Right?

66
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I don't know

67
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I don't know

68
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
What do you mean?

69
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I have to go to the Hollow, so I can't go there

70
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I'll go to the Go Masuri soon

71
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Please think about it

72
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I really can't do it

73
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
K-POP is getting more and more popular

74
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
It's been 15 years since K-POP was shown on TV

75
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Will he be able to show off his coolness?

76
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
To fulfill the wish of K-POP, which is the overall production of this program

77
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
4 men stood up

78
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
This program is provided by the sponsors of the 5th generation

79
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Let's clean up

80
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Excuse me

81
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Excuse me

82
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Thank you

83
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Are you cool?

84
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Of course

85
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Of course, I'm cool

86
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:25,000
So I think it would be nice if I could show it as my whole body

87
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Let's talk about it

88
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I think a cool guy is a cowboy

89
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
In terms of appearance

90
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I think so

91
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I want to prepare all the costumes

92
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Excuse me

93
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
What kind of person is he?

94
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
He's a cowboy

95
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
He's a rodeo

96
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
A rodeo

97
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
He's a man

98
00:03:52,000 --> 00:04:13,000
What do you think?

99
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
What?

100
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Are you sure you're cool?

101
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I think he's cool

102
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I think he's definitely cool

103
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Say it yourself

104
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
It's annoying

105
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
What?

106
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:35,000
What if we've been friends for 20 years?

107
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Should we do it? Should we not do it?

108
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
You've been talking for so long

109
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
We've been thinking about it

110
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
It's better to do it

111
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
It's definitely cool

112
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Let's do it

113
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
What are you doing?

114
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
It's the same thing

115
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
We'll be waiting

116
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Show us a cool uniform on the rodeo

117
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
This is perfect

118
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
It costs a lot of money

119
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I prepared this

120
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I had it set up like this

121
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I see

122
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Even if it falls, it's okay

123
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I don't care

124
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
It's good

125
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Thank you

126
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
It's easy

127
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Anyone can do it

128
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I'm getting excited

129
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
It's good

130
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Shall we go?

131
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Let's go

132
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
We can go anytime

133
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Let's put it on

134
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Just in case

135
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
It's cool enough

136
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
It's cool enough

137
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Let's do a pose

138
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Isn't it good?

139
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Anyone can do it

140
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Please hold the camera

141
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Let's go

142
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
No

143
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Just turn around

144
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Excuse me

145
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I'm scared

146
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
We just turned around

147
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
From now on

148
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I don't like it

149
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,000
It sounds bad

150
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,000
It's fun

151
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Show us a cool one

152
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Let's go

153
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I don't like it

154
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Excuse me

155
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Remember this

156
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Mr. Hemo

157
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
What should we do?

158
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Why are you scared?

159
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
We just turned around

160
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
It's fun

161
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Why are you angry?

162
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Let's apologize

163
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
We can't do that

164
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
What's wrong?

165
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
What do you think?

166
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Again?

167
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I'm so excited

168
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I finally calmed down

169
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
There's some improvement

170
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Let's talk about it

171
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Improvement?

172
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
We can't do it like this

173
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I want you to explain it

174
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Can you ask him?

175
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Excuse me

176
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Excuse me

177
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Mr. Hemo

178
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Can we talk?

179
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Let's talk

180
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Your appearance

181
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:14,000
You look like you're scared

182
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Can you change your appearance?

183
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:28,000
What do you think?

184
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I trust you

185
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Really?

186
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Thank you

187
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
If something happens to you

188
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
God's punishment will come

189
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I don't think it's a punishment

190
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:50,000
What do you mean?

191
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I think it's a good thing

192
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
We're friends

193
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I'm glad you think so

194
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:06,000
You're reading an old book

195
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Let's see your cool appearance

196
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
This is good

197
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
It's not scary

198
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
It's a flower field

199
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
The color is pink

200
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
It's here

201
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I've been waiting

202
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
What do you think?

203
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
It's fun

204
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I like it because it's cute

205
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
That's good

206
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
The machine was out of order

207
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I think it will change the atmosphere

208
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
It's not just this

209
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I've prepared this for you

210
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Look

211
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
It's cute

212
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
You're smiling

213
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I can't help it

214
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I'm trying to talk

215
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
What do you think?

216
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
It would be nice if you could show your cool side

217
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
It would be romantic

218
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,000
It's like a compliment

219
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
It's like a joke

220
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I said it as it is

221
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I said the language

222
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Heba

223
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
She's right in front

224
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Are you okay?

225
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Show your cool side

226
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Let's go

227
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:09,000
It's here

228
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Why are you coming back?

229
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Why are you coming back?

230
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Heba

231
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
You've done too much

232
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Heba

233
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
You've done too much

234
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
This is tough

235
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Thank you for coming

236
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I'm sorry

237
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Thank you

238
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I'm going

239
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Thank you

240
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Go back

241
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
It's really bad

242
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I told you

243
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Don't be shy in front of a woman

244
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
That's what it is

245
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
You brought a woman

246
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
You were embarrassed

247
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
It's weird

248
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Let me explain

249
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I don't think I'll see her

250
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Really?

251
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I don't think I'll see her

252
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
You're lying

253
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
It can't be helped

254
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
What?

255
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
It's too early

256
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
It's too early

257
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I'm sorry

258
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Heba

259
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
We're going to talk about it

260
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
This is a point of improvement

261
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
We've talked about it

262
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I think machines are different

263
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,000
In that sense, if you try to do it with horror

264
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:47,000
It's a human's way

265
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I understand that

266
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
He said he wanted to go to Shibaki.

267
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Yeah, we've been doing it for a long time.

268
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:04,000
He said he couldn't make it to the next step without going to Shibaki.

269
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Who was the most excited?

270
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I'm sorry.

271
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:25,000
To be honest, I wasn't as excited as I usually am.

272
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Show us some cool martial arts.

273
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I thought he was really mad at you.

274
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Yeah, I thought so, too.

275
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
But it's not the end.

276
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
It's almost done.

277
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:46,000
It's like this. It's not a machine anymore.

278
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
You'll see when you see it.

279
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I can imagine what it'll be like.

280
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
This is a pretty gentle feeling.

281
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
That's fine.

282
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Well, then.

283
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Yes, please.

284
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Please come this way.

285
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
This is okay.

286
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
It's like this.

287
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Then, Mr. Hebu.

288
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Please get on.

289
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
It's pretty heavy.

290
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Mr. Hebu, it's pretty heavy.

291
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
It's coming.

292
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Then I'll give you one.

293
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
You've been saying that for a long time, Mr. Hebu.

294
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Wait a minute.

295
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Wait a minute.

296
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
It's okay.

297
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Let's go.

298
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Let's go.

299
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
It hurts.

300
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Wait a minute.

301
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
What's wrong with you?

302
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
What's wrong?

303
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
What's wrong?

304
00:15:51,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Are you okay?

305
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
You guys.

306
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
You're the devil who wears a mask on someone's face.

307
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Mr. Hebu.

308
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
What are you doing?

309
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Yama-chan, are you okay?

310
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
What's wrong?

311
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
That's a gun.

312
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
It's stuck.

313
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Yama-chan, it's stuck.

314
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
It's stuck.

315
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I almost died.

316
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
That's the last thing I can do.

317
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
That's the last thing I can do.

318
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Please go home.

319
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
No.

320
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
No.

321
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Please go home today.

322
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
We've come this far.

323
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
We've done our best.

324
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I'm really angry.

325
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I'll explain it to you now.

326
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
It's definitely okay.

327
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I don't think it's possible.

328
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Please.

329
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Please go home.

330
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
That was fast.

331
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
That was fast.

332
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
But it was better than I expected.

333
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Excuse me.

334
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Excuse me.

335
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I don't know what I'm doing.

336
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Mr. Hebu.

337
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Why did you come today?

338
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Excuse me.

339
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Excuse me.

340
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I'm sorry.

341
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I did my best thinking about you.

342
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Yama-chan, your ears are getting swollen.

343
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:40,000
How do you feel about this?

344
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I'm not about that.

345
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Who do you want to kill?

346
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Who do you want to kill, Ebou-san?

347
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I know, I know.

348
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I'm sorry.

349
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I think this is the last time.

350
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:15,000
We have to do it in a safe way. No fear, no danger.

351
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
And we have to look cool.

352
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Can we really do that?

353
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Yes, we can.

354
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
What are you going to do?

355
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Really?

356
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I want to kill one more person.

357
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Who is it, Ebou-san?

358
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Hama-san...

359
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Who is it?

360
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Hama-san, good.

361
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Mimimi?

362
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I'm counting on you.

363
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Get Ebou-san right away.

364
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I'm counting on you.

365
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Let's see cool Ebou on the rodeo.

366
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,000
If you complain about this, I'm sorry.

367
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Why did you have to do this?

368
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Honestly, I'm embarrassed.

369
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I'm sorry.

370
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
It's okay, I'll do it.

371
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Oh, it's running.

372
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
It's going well.

373
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Ebou-san, you can see that it's not dangerous.

374
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
It's definitely safe.

375
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
What do you think?

376
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:43,000
There was a lot of trouble, but if the end is good, everything is good.

377
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I'm very grateful that I was able to come to Hamada.

378
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Is that so?

379
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,000
As for the end, I'm not satisfied yet.

380
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Is that so?

381
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Is this okay?

382
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
It's okay.

383
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
But really...

384
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
It's okay.

385
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I'll leave it to you.

386
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
If you can do it with love.

387
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
We've been together for years.

388
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I'll do it.

389
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
If it's okay, I can't do it.

390
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
That's right, you can't do it.

391
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Okay, let's go.

392
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Ebou-san.

393
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:19,000
It's going to be cool.

394
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I'll show you something cool.

395
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Okay, okay, okay.

396
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

397
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Oh, that's cool.

398
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Good luck, Ebou-san.

399
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
It's hot.

400
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Do you want some more?

401
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
This is...

402
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:10,000
I don't know.

403
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,000
This week, we will have an unreleased talk.

404
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,000
What's inside Antonio Inoki's chin?

405
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
This is also an orthodox...

406
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
It's a fight.

407
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
It's a fight.

408
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
I'll tell you what's inside.

409
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
That's a stick.

410
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
I'm just putting it in.

411
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Screamer?

412
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Screamer.

413
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:36,000
If you take it off, there's something like a caster.

414
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
It's like a piece of this.

415
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Something like this.

416
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
That's coming out.

417
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Yeah.

418
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Why?

419
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:48,000
So, if you hold Inoki's legs, it's like that.

420
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Once, it goes like this. If you suddenly can't do this, it goes like this.

421
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Suddenly, it can't turn.

422
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Inoki is also scared, scared, scared, scared, scared.

423
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
It goes like this, goes like this, goes like this.

424
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
That's right.

425
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
It's funny when you show the picture.

426
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
There's nothing here.

427
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
There's a caster.

428
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Inoki, when he's about Inoki, he doesn't walk at all.

429
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
I think that's hard.

430
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Why is that? Fujita can do it.

431
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Anyone can do it.

432
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
When you can't do it, you want to hide it, so you put it in here.

433
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
That's right. When the road is wide, it's fine.

434
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Fujita can also do it like this.

435
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,000
When it's narrow, if it goes like this, it goes like this once.

436
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
That's enough.

437
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Recently, Fujita has gone out once and looked for it like this.

438
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:47,000
There's nothing here.

439
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Fujita can also do it.

440
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
I understand that well.

441
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,000
So, when it's narrow, it goes like this.

442
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:05,000
In that case, it goes like this.

443
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Everyone is trying to laugh.

444
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
I can't laugh at that kind of exaggeration.

445
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:17,000
It goes like this.

446
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
You're doing a lot of shurin.

447
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
I'm tired of it.

448
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Shut up.

449
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
It goes like this.

450
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:30,000
I'm going home.

451
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:40,000
