1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
7.Juice

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry

3
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
What kind of person are you?

4
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm sorry

5
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
It's not like that, I really went too far

6
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
If I go like this, it's weird if I wear a suit

7
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
So today I'm like this

8
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I thought I should talk about why I went too far

9
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I usually do it at home with a barricade

10
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I do it

11
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I usually do it a bit longer

12
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
About 5mm

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm done

14
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I went to the bathroom

15
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I do it in the bathroom

16
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I went to the bathroom and looked

17
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
This part was a bit long

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
But I already cleaned the barricade

19
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I cleaned it with a brush

20
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I was curious about this part

21
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
So I jumped into the bathroom

22
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
And went

23
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
When I cleaned the barricade

24
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I took off the attachment

25
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
There's one

26
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
The one that takes a few millimeters

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
The one that takes a few millimeters

28
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I took off all of it

29
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Bye bye bye bye

30
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
What is this sound?

31
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
It's too short

32
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
When I looked in the mirror

33
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I looked like a Kamen Rider

34
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
You did it all at once

35
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I had to do it all at once

36
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I had to do it all with my skin color

37
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
After 3 days

38
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I was able to show it to everyone

39
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
It became a product

40
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I don't know if it'll fit in my mouth

41
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I'm sorry

42
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
What is it?

43
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Is it okay?

44
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
This...

45
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Really...

46
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Nothing happened

47
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I was smoking while doing it

48
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I thought I should throw it away

49
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
But it hit me

50
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Hey you!

51
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
What are you doing?

52
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
It was just before I went to the bathroom

53
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
It hit me

54
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
It was like a cannon

55
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
After that

56
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I was taking a bath

57
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
You washed your hands right?

58
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I washed my hands

59
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
It went out

60
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
If you put your hand under the faucet

61
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
The water will automatically come out

62
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
It was like that

63
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
It went out

64
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I was like

65
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I'm sorry, can you stop it?

66
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I was like

67
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
What?

68
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Can you stop it?

69
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
It was automatic right?

70
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Really

71
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
My brain...

72
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I went to the bathroom too much

73
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I'm really sorry

74
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
That's the reason

75
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
It's fine

76
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
It's my revenge

77
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I didn't do anything wrong

78
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
You're going to get hit

79
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
That's right

80
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Have you decided on your vacation?

81
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
What is it?

82
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Where are you going?

83
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I'm not going

84
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Why are you so down?

85
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Where are you going?

86
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
What?

87
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Where are you going?

88
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Where are you going?

89
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Where are you going?

90
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
2 weeks?

91
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I can't do 2 weeks

92
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
If you're going to do 2 weeks

93
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Do it slowly

94
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
You understand right?

95
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Go

96
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Go

97
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Where are you going?

98
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I'm not going

99
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Where are you going?

100
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I'm not going

101
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I really

102
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I really don't have money

103
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I'm really sorry

104
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
You don't have money

105
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I really don't have money

106
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I have a lot of cars

107
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
You have a lot?

108
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
You're the only one who has money

109
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I have a Mercedes

110
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Wait a minute

111
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
You have 2 cars

112
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
No

113
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
You have 3 cars

114
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I don't have money

115
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
What are you talking about?

116
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
You have 3 cars

117
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
No

118
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I only have one car

119
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I only have one car

120
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I also have a Jaguar

121
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
What is a Jaguar?

122
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
It's like this

123
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
It's like this

124
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
The one in front of the hood

125
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
It's like this

126
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Show me

127
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Show it to the camera

128
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I want to see it

129
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I'm really sorry

130
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
You're the only one who has money

131
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Your head is like this right?

132
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Where are you going?

133
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I don't have money

134
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
The holiday trip is in a Harley

135
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Yes

136
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
What are the conditions for a man who looks good in a Harley Davidson?

137
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
This is

138
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Are you riding a Harley?

139
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
You just said, are you riding a Harley?

140
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I want to say

141
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Are you riding a Harley?

142
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
That's how much I want to ride a Harley

143
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
You don't have a license

144
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I have a Harley license

145
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I have a Harley license

146
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
You have a Harley license?

147
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
You guys are so stupid

148
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
It's easy for you to understand

149
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I have a license

150
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I have everything

151
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
What are the conditions for a man who looks good in a Harley?

152
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Let's think about what it means to not look good

153
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
For example, you're wearing glasses right?

154
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:43,000
What do you think is the thing that doesn't look good on people who are wearing glasses?

155
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Glasses

156
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
What?

157
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,000
If you put the same thing on top of each other it doesn't look good

158
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Just now

159
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
The audience saw me with very fascinating eyes

160
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
What are you talking about?

161
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Don't you understand?

162
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
So you're saying that you shouldn't wear glasses over glasses?

163
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,000
That's...

164
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
No one does that

165
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
So let's go back to the Harley

166
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
People who are wearing back mirrors don't look good right?

167
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Where?

168
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Here?

169
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Well you're wearing it here right?

170
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
That's right

171
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
So it doesn't look good on people like that

172
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
But no one is wearing a back mirror

173
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
So you really don't know how to say an example

174
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
No no

175
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I understand an example

176
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
That's an example

177
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Don't ask me for an example

178
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
If you ask me for an example I won't answer

179
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
If you ask me for an example like that no one will understand

180
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,000
For example, someone who wants to ride a red Porsche

181
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,000
The person who doesn't look good in a red Porsche is a red person

182
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
It's red

183
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
But I'm not that kind of person

184
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
So don't ask me for an example

185
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Don't ask me for an example

186
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I'm talking about how you don't look good in a Harley

187
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I don't look good in a Harley?

188
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
What?

189
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
What are the conditions for a man who looks good in a Harley?

190
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
That's an example

191
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
That's why I said it

192
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
It's the first time you're saying it

193
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
If you didn't say it earlier I would have said it

194
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
You don't listen to me

195
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I don't understand

196
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
What are you doing?

197
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
What are you doing?

198
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Wait a minute

199
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
You're talking about an example

200
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Okay okay

201
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I'll take it

202
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I'll erase it

203
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
For example, when you're looking for a room

204
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
If you say something you don't need

205
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
You'll see the room you're looking for

206
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
This is also an example

207
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
No no

208
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Don't take an example from now on

209
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
No no

210
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I don't need anything

211
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I don't need a Japanese room

212
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Yes yes yes

213
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
A room without a Japanese room

214
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
If you keep talking about your dreams

215
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
It will get bigger and bigger and you won't understand

216
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
So think of it as an elimination method

217
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
If you find someone who doesn't suit Harley

218
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
You'll see someone who suits Harley

219
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I understand that

220
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I said earlier

221
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
There's no one with a mirror here

222
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
This is a good thing

223
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Right?

224
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
That's why

225
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
The example from the nose is strange

226
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
There's no elimination method

227
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
But

228
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
You can go in from the nose

229
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Yes yes yes

230
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
But

231
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
But

232
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
One of them disappeared

233
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
One of them disappeared

234
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
That's an example

235
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
You really

236
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
How did you raise him?

237
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
What kind of trauma did you have?

238
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I don't have one

239
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
The example is strange

240
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
So

241
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Overall

242
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
It's a person who doesn't suit Harley

243
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
There's a lot of people who don't suit Harley

244
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Everyone

245
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Why everyone?

246
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
You suit Harley

247
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I don't suit Harley

248
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I'm Harley

249
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
No no you're not

250
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I don't know what you're talking about

251
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
That's

252
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I don't know what you're talking about

253
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
It's about the reactions when you take a picture

254
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
It's not cool to be happy

255
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
It's just a strike

256
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
It's not cool to be happy

257
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
If you have a good line or pose

258
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Please tell me

259
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
You rarely

260
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Your fingers are crooked so you can't take pictures

261
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
What do you do?

262
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
If you have a good line

263
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I'll tell you one thing

264
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
You have a good line when you have a good line

265
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
But when you don't have a good line, it's really bad

266
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
There are times when you have a stupid face

267
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Your mouth

268
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
There are times when you don't have a good line

269
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Do it well

270
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
What do you do when you take a strike or spare?

271
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
What do you do?

272
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I said

273
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
What do you do?

274
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I said together

275
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
It's Onobori

276
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
It's Onobori

277
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Why?

278
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Bowling Onobori

279
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Why?

280
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
It's not cool at all

281
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I got 196

282
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
That's not good

283
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
196 is not good

284
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I really

285
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I really

286
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I'm really amazing

287
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:57,000
The light bulb of the crown of the previous strike was cut off

288
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
That's your fault

289
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
The light bulb was cut off

290
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I can't catch up

291
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I can't catch up

292
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
It's too bright and I can't catch up

293
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Again?

294
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:15,000
What am I?

295
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I still can't catch up

296
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I'm like a fool

297
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
If you can do that, that's right

298
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Now, when you take a strike

299
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
When you take a strike

300
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Please tell me

301
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Isn't this enough?

302
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Come back and do this

303
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I don't understand the meaning

304
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I did it

305
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:43,000
What's the meaning of the second arm?

306
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Is that right?

307
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
It's going to be good, isn't it?

308
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I'm going to be going this way

309
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I'm going to be going this way

310
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I'm going to say goodbye

311
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I was like, there's more to it.

312
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
And then I went home.

313
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
You know what I mean?

314
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
And then I went home and...

315
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I was in my bed.

316
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I had a book.

317
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
And then I went to sleep.

318
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
That's all.

319
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:49,000
That's all.
