1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
What is today's topic?

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
What is today's topic?

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Today...

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Here

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
That's right

6
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Look

7
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
He says he has worries

8
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Yes

9
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I'm sure you do

10
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
That's dirty

11
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I'm sure you have 1000 or 2000

12
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
That's a lot

13
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
But

14
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I have a lot of worries now

15
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
But I have the most

16
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
What do you think?

17
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I want to break up with you

18
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
With Suwa-san?

19
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
No

20
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
You're still going on?

21
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
What do you mean?

22
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Stop it

23
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
It's Inoue Harumi-san

24
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
What?

25
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I want to break up with her

26
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
What?

27
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Inoue Harumi?

28
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Yes

29
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
That's what it is

30
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Really?

31
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Yes

32
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I'm friends with Inoue Harumi

33
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
So I wanted her to talk to Otomo-san

34
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
What?

35
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
You're friends with her?

36
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
No

37
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'm calling her

38
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'll talk to her first

39
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Then I'll talk to her

40
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Then I'll break up with Otomo-san

41
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
That's amazing

42
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm sorry but I have to use the TV

43
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Sorry

44
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
How do you know her?

45
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:31,000
That's amazing

46
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
This program is brought to you by the following sponsors

47
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Why are you going out with her?

48
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
It's been a while

49
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
It's been a while

50
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I think you know

51
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
She's coming

52
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
What?

53
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
She's coming

54
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I think you know

55
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
She wants to talk to you

56
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I think you should talk to her

57
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Who?

58
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Otomo-san

59
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
It's been a while

60
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Sit here

61
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
It's hard to talk to her

62
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:18,000
The reason I asked you to come here today is

63
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I thought it would be better to tell Harumi my honest feelings

64
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Don't say it's a bus

65
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Sorry

66
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
You came from Kumamoto

67
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:48,000
You won the 91st Grand Prix at TV Asahi Idol Academy

68
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Then you started performing at Sakurako Club

69
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
You didn't even look back at your debut song

70
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Of course you have it

71
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I trained you to be a top idol

72
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
What are you talking about?

73
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:19,000
That was about a year ago

74
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:34,000
A year ago, I was happy when I didn't have anything

75
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
You started singing

76
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
In the end

77
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I thought about getting married

78
00:03:51,000 --> 00:04:00,000
But in the end, it was my body

79
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I think you'll notice, but it was my body

80
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
That's why

81
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Thank you

82
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000
What?

83
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
It's nice to say goodbye

84
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
The cherry blossoms are blooming

85
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
It's good to say goodbye

86
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
What?

87
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Thank you

88
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
You don't have to remember today

89
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
We were worried

90
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Mr. Onuma is worried

91
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
It's a good time to say goodbye

92
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Let's talk

93
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:20,000
It's hard to say goodbye

94
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Mr. Onuma had a girlfriend

95
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
He's popular

96
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
He's very popular

97
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Good morning

98
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I'm sorry

99
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
You're late

100
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Were you waiting for me?

101
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I was waiting for you

102
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
He's here

103
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I'll call him

104
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Him?

105
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Yes

106
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
He's here

107
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I'll tell you everything

108
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,000
You have something to say to me

109
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
What's going on?

110
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
What?

111
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Did you cut your hair?

112
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Yes

113
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
What's going on?

114
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Why don't you talk to me?

115
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Why don't you talk to him?

116
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Him?

117
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
You know I like long hair

118
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
No

119
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
It may be good for fans

120
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Your relationship with me is not like that

121
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
You have something to say to him

122
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
It's not like that

123
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I'm tired

124
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I don't think I can date you

125
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
You don't think you can date him?

126
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I'm attracted to Hina Yoshikawa

127
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
She talks to me about everything

128
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
He's crazy

129
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I can't date you

130
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I can't date you

131
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Good bye

132
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Thank you

133
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Thank you

134
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Let's go home

135
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Wait

136
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I have something to say

137
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Who are you?

138
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Are you a driver?

139
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Where are you going?

140
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
What's going on?

141
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I have something to confirm

142
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I can't go alone

143
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
You can go with me

144
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Me?

145
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Wait

146
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Do you know me?

147
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I think so

148
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Really?

149
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I have something to confirm

150
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I'm curious

151
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I want to know

152
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
You want to know?

153
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Who are you?

154
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I'm Noriko Tachikawa

155
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
That's a good place

156
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I didn't know

157
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I'll help you

158
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Wait

159
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
You look blue

160
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Tachikawa

161
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Long time no see

162
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I don't know why

163
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I have something to talk to you

164
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
What?

165
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
To you

166
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
To me?

167
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Wait

168
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I'll call you

169
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I said what I wanted to say

170
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I'll talk to you

171
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Good luck

172
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
How are you?

173
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Long time no see

174
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
What?

175
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,000
What are you hiding from me?

176
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
What?

177
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Can I have some water?

178
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Wait

179
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
What do you want?

180
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Are you seeing a man?

181
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I didn't put a lid on you

182
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
This?

183
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Yes

184
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I bought this yesterday

185
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
It's too late

186
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
How much do you like?

187
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I don't know what you're talking about

188
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I don't want to break up with you

189
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I don't know if I can break up with you

190
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,000
It's up to me

191
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
It's up to you

192
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
We don't know

193
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Let's break up

194
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
It's okay

195
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
You changed

196
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Let's break up

197
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Let's go home

198
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Okay

199
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I failed today

200
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Let's go home

201
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Good bye

202
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
How was it?

203
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I wanted to break up with you

204
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
But you changed

205
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
You can be a man

206
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I'm not

207
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I can't do it

208
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I can't do it

209
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Be careful

210
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Idiot

211
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
You are an idiot

212
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
You are an idiot

213
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
You are an idiot

214
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
You are an idiot

215
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
He's always in a bad mood

216
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I don't like it

217
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
He's always in a bad mood

218
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
His neck hurts

219
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
He has many diseases

220
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
He doesn't have many

221
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
His neck and butt

222
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
His butt

223
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
He doesn't have many

224
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
He doesn't have many

225
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
He's amazing

226
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
He has a great body

227
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Stop it

228
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Why?

229
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Don't say that again

230
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
It's a bad image

231
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:24,000
People don't know that

232
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
He's not a bad guy

233
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
He's a bad guy

234
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I don't know what's inside the box

235
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
He said it's a dice

236
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
That's why it's rough

237
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:44,000
He said run away

238
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I understand

239
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
That's why it's rough

240
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Stop it

241
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Don't force it

242
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
What?

243
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Don't force it

244
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
No, don't force it

245
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Don't force it

246
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I'll tell you

247
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
You have a middle-aged body

248
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Right?

249
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I'm hungry

250
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I'm surprised

251
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
You have a middle-aged body

252
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
My abs

253
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
It's amazing

254
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Your abs

255
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I don't know if I can break it

256
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I'm sorry

257
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Really?

258
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
You used to tell your family about this

259
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,000
You should do something

260
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I'm a pig

261
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I'm far from pigs

262
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
What are you doing?

263
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
What are you doing?

264
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I'm thin

265
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I'm fat and thin

266
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
But you're like this

267
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:18,000
You're like this

268
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
You're wrong

269
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Why?

270
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
You know it

271
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I used to be fat

272
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Right?

273
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
When I debuted

274
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I was about 20

275
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
But I didn't think I was fat

276
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
What about me?

277
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
What about me?

278
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
But you used to say, what about me?

279
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Because I'm fat

280
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
No, you used to say, what about me?

281
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
What about Chocobo?

282
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
What about me?

283
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
This is strange

284
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,000
When you're famous, people call you Hama-chan or Machan

285
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
But before you're famous, people call you by the atmosphere

286
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
They call you big

287
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:04,000
But back then, people used to call you fat

288
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I used to get hit by this

289
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I was like this

290
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:18,000
My joints were strange

291
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I wanted to lose weight

292
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I see

293
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
But I was strong-willed

294
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I lost weight

295
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I was like this

296
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Right

297
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Back then, I weighed 53kg

298
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Now I'm 55kg

299
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
That's not true

300
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
That's not true

301
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Stop being a pig

302
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I'm not a pig

303
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I'm not trying to be a pig

304
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I used to be like that

305
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,000
The real pig is like Fujiwara

306
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I was riding with him when we were heading to the NK hall

307
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
We were riding together

308
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
He didn't have a female seat

309
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Why?

310
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
It was raining

311
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
But the car was cloudy

312
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I used to be like that

313
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I could feel the gas coming out of my body

314
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I was like, are you new?

315
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I didn't say anything

316
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I was like this

317
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Hey, it's cloudy again

318
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I'm sorry

319
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
He must be hot

320
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
He must be hot

321
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
If he's fat, why?

322
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Fat people have heat

323
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,000
When I think it should be cloudy

324
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I get excited

325
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
When I think it should be cloudy

326
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I get excited

327
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
That's what you call a pig

328
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I'm not a pig

329
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I'm not saying I'm a pig

330
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I'm just saying I used to be like this

331
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I don't think you've changed

332
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I'll tell you one thing

333
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
You say you're hungry

334
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
But everyone is hungry

335
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I can say that

336
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I was 24 when I was born

337
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Then let's be clear

338
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Even Sorimachi Takashi is hungry

339
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I'm hungry

340
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:34,000
When they're on TV, they do this

341
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
They push their whole body

342
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
They're doing it because they're still young

343
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:47,000
They have that kind of intention

344
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Don't take it!

345
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
It hurts

346
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,000
That's not funny

347
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
It's okay

348
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
They're interested in each other

349
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Because it's a popular business

350
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Sorimachi...

351
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I get it

352
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:15,000
When they're on TV, they do this

353
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Hello, I'm Sorimachi

354
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Hello, I'm Sorimachi

355
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Why are you wearing a uniform?

356
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Why are you wearing a uniform?

357
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
That's how it is

358
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,000
When you're young, you still have that kind of desire

359
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I'm the farthest from pigs

360
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I already have a name tag

361
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
That's a new word

362
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
A name tag?

363
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Wait

364
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I have it in my bag

365
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
You have a name tag in your bag?

366
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,000
What does a famous musician do?

367
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
A star

368
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:12,000
For example, what are Inoue Yousui and Nagabuchi Tsuyoshi doing right now?

369
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
That's a good question

370
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
People are interested in that

371
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
That's right

372
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
You can't meet them on the street

373
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Inoue Yousui is a normal person

374
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I don't think he's changed

375
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
What about Nagabuchi Tsuyoshi?

376
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:37,000
He doesn't have a lot of privacy

377
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I think that's all I can say

378
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I'll tell someone who's only here

379
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
I'll edit it

380
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Wait a minute

381
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I'll take a look

382
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
What?

383
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
I'll call Nagabuchi Tsuyoshi

384
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I'm sorry, I'm in a new place

385
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I've never been here before

386
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Let's take a look

387
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Ah, ah

388
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
This is new

389
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Ah, I see

390
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
I got it

391
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I'm making gyoza sauce

392
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:24,000
There was too much vinegar, so I thought I'd add more soy sauce

393
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:30,000
It's almost done

394
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:35,000
It's said that the first thing you see is an egg shell

395
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
That's right

396
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
I think there's a limit to that

397
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
A limit?

398
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
How much do you think is an egg shell?

399
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
How much do you think it is?

400
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
It's a living thing

401
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
I see

402
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:54,000
For example, let's say you were there when the shell broke

403
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
I think it's you

404
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Is that so?

405
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,000
No matter how heavy you are

406
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I don't care

407
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Then it's fine

408
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
No, it's not

409
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
You're just like Kuyo Kuyo

410
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,000
If you say that, everyone will think I'm heavy

411
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:22,000
What are you doing?

412
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Don't call me Kuyo Kuyo

413
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I'm going to pee

414
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Where?

415
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
I'm going to pee where Kuyo Kuyo is

416
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Then add some weight

417
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
No, I won't

418
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Why not?

419
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Then people will think I'm your father

420
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
That's what I'm saying

421
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Then people will think I'm your father

422
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
I see

423
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
People will think I'm a person with a deep heart

424
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
It's fine if you're a human

425
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I'll say it quickly

426
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:06,000
You're the only one who's lost

427
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:11,000
You're in the way of talking to me

428
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:16,000
I said it one by one, but you're a human

429
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Then a dog

430
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
A dog will bark

431
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
What do you mean by a dog?

432
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
It's scary

433
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
It's fine, I'm your father

434
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
It's fine

435
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
It's fine for a dog

436
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Then the dog will say

437
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:37,000
You're not going to do it with me?

438
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Then the dog will say

439
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Do it!

440
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Then the dog will say

441
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Do it!

442
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
What are you doing?

443
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Are you my partner?

444
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Are you my partner?

445
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Then a fish

446
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
A goldfish

447
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
A goldfish

448
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:10,000
I got it, let's do it

449
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
What is it?

450
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
It's taking a long time

451
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
It's taking a long time

452
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,000
I'm your father

453
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Goldfish is fine

454
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Goldfish is

455
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Do it!

456
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Goldfish is fine

457
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Goldfish is fine

458
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Do it together

459
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:40,000
I want to do it with you

460
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
If you don't want to do it, then go home

461
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
That's what I want to know

462
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Will you do it in the future?

463
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Say it now

464
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:55,000
If you don't want to do it, then go home

465
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,000
What about cockroaches?

466
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
You came to a good place

467
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Thank you

468
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,000
It's hard to call this a father

469
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
I see

470
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Let's do it

471
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:14,000
I'm your partner

472
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:19,000
It's like an old comedy

473
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:36,000
This program was brought to you by these sponsors
