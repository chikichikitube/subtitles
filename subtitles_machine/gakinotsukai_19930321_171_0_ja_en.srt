1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Please, please, Gaki no Tsukai Ara Hende!

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:07,500
Good evening.

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:08,500
Good evening.

4
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:10,500
It's Gaki no Tsukai Ara Hende.

5
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:14,000
Hey, today, from the waiting room of this soap...

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,500
That's not it!

7
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,000
Today is amazing!

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:17,500
Is that so?

9
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,000
The title is long, long!

10
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:19,500
Long?

11
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:20,000
Yes!

12
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,000
Three and a half years of history.

13
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:23,500
Oh!

14
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:30,500
Souketsu-san's Perfect Preservation! Gaki no Tsukai's Battle and Punishment Game! Soushiu's Golden Spirits!

15
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:33,500
Up until now, we've played the battle and punishment games.

16
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,000
In Gaki no Tsukai.

17
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:35,500
Yes.

18
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,500
Today, we'd like you to see all of that.

19
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:38,000
Oh.

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:38,500
That's what we'll do.

21
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,500
Oh, my turn is slow.

22
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,500
That's not it.

23
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,500
Hey, but Kohaku was amazing.

24
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:54,000
Yeah.

25
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,500
I can't believe it. Which one did you win?

26
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,000
Eh?

27
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
People who watch TV know.

28
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Shall we bet?

29
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,500
Eh?

30
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,000
Shall we bet?

31
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:05,500
What?

32
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,000
Which one did you win?

33
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Let me go first.

34
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,500
Red wins.

35
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,000
I'll go with white.

36
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,500
If I lose,

37
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:16,500
I'll do this behind the camera on Zoom-in Morning.

38
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,000
I'll dress up like this.

39
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I don't think that's right.

40
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,500
You do that.

41
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:21,500
It's a different song.

42
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,500
I'll do a garala nyorororo.

43
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:41,500
I'll do a garala nyorororo on Zoom-in Morning.

44
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:55,500
It's a refreshing morning.

45
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:58,500
Good morning.

46
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,500
Good morning.

47
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:02,500
It's Wednesday, January 17th.

48
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:15,500
First of all, let's go to Shizuoka and Zoom-in.

49
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:18,500
We started at 5 o'clock in the morning.

50
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:21,500
There are 146 people.

51
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:25,500
And 154 people were injured.

52
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,500
It's like a strange person is coming from the morning.

53
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:34,000
My son wants to become a creative person.

54
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Maybe I'll do that after I go home.

55
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,500
I'm going to make a cafeteria with industrial food.

56
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:57,320
It's so large that the wall doesn't have

57
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:01,320
What is the correct answer?

58
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:06,320
I can answer anything with su.

59
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,320
Sweet.

60
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:11,320
Usu.

61
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,320
Suika.

62
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:16,320
Karasu.

63
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:20,320
Sushi.

64
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,320
Shiwasu.

65
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,320
You said it.

66
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:27,320
I said shiwasu the day before yesterday.

67
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,320
You can't do that.

68
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:31,320
You lose.

69
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,320
The end.

70
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,320
You can't do that.

71
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,320
Wait a minute.

72
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:51,320
Don't do that.

73
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,320
It hurts.

74
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,320
It's noisy.

75
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,320
It hurts.

76
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,320
You'll get a cramp in your hand.

77
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,320
That's good.

78
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,320
That's good.

79
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:04,320
This is cool.

80
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:07,320
I'll do the promotion.

81
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,320
Thank you very much.

82
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:13,320
Let's go this way.
