00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
In the 1st episode of Gaki no Tsukai Arahen, Chikichiki Team Project,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Since We Don't Have Money, Let's Go Pee Grand Prix!

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Again, that...

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
That's a small compliment.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Is it because you don't have money?

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Well, we do have money, but...

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
We don't have money.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
We don't have enough to pay for it.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Today, a person who has a lot of pee will receive a prize.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
That's nice.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
How much is this?

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
How much is it?

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
100,000 yen.

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
100,000 yen.

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
100,000 yen!

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
100,000 yen!

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
If you pay for your pee, you'll get 100,000 yen.

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
That's not a lot.

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
That's not true.

20
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I wouldn't do such a stupid thing.

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Well, you can do whatever you want.

22
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
It's time to drink to get more pee.

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
You're still drinking, aren't you?

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I don't want to drink. I want to drink again.

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm telling you to pee, but you're eating chocolate.

26
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I think I can drink a lot.

27
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I think I can drink a lot.

28
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Can you drink it all at once?

29
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Yes, yes, yes.

30
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Okamoto-chan.

31
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You're still angry, aren't you?

32
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
He's even more angry.

33
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
What should I do with Mr. Yokuda?

34
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Don't bother me too much.

35
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Don't bother me too much.

36
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:03,000
It's a game where you pee on a water wheel and the water wheel spins.

37
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Let's do it in order.

38
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I think it's better to sit down.

39
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Don't be distracted.

40
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I see.

41
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I can't go from there.

42
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
This guy seems to be a winning candidate.

43
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
It's not like I can do it if I do my best.

44
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I'll play the sound.

45
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Be more energetic.

46
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Look at me.

47
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
What?

48
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
It doesn't spin.

49
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
It starts to move.

50
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
What?

51
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Do it until it stops.

52
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I don't know if this is good or bad.

53
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
It's still coming out.

54
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
You're coming out a lot.

55
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
You're amazing.

56
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:05,000
You're coming out a lot.

57
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
You're coming out a lot.

58
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
You're coming out a lot.

59
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:18,000
It's stopped halfway.

60
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
You're weird.

61
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
You're coming out a lot.

62
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
21.

63
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
This is a strong opponent.

64
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I'll do it.

65
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
You're good.

66
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
You're good.

67
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
It stopped.

68
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
There's one more.

69
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
You're doing well.

70
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
How many seconds is it now?

71
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
15 seconds.

72
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
10 more seconds.

73
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:55,000
It's coming out.

74
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
You're good.

75
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
17 seconds.

76
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Do you want to do it again?

77
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Do you want to do it again?

78
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Do you want to do it again?

79
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
It's coming out a lot.

80
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
You're coming out a lot.

81
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
You're weird.

82
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Why?

83
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
You're coming out a lot.

84
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
It's coming out.

85
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
That was a waste.

86
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
It's coming out a lot.

87
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Is it coming out?

88
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
It's coming out a lot.

89
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
It's coming out a lot.

90
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
It's zero.

91
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
It's not coming out at all.

92
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
How many seconds is it?

93
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
It's coming!

94
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
30 seconds

95
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
It's coming

96
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
13

97
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
14

98
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
It's 14

99
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
It's 14

100
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
15

101
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
It's 15

102
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
No way!

103
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Seriously?

104
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
It's not working

105
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
It's coming

106
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
It's not working at all

107
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
It's not working at all

108
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
You just need to prove it

109
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Go to the toilet

110
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
That was fun

111
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I...

112
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Wait a minute

113
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
It's coming

114
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
It's coming

115
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
It's not working at all

116
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
What?

117
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
It's spinning

118
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
It's spinning a little

119
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
That's mean

120
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I'll go

121
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Shake it

122
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I don't want to

123
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I don't want to

124
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
It's coming

125
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
You're good

126
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
It stopped

127
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
It's coming back

128
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
GG

129
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
8 seconds

130
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
It's coming

131
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
21 seconds

132
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
It's coming

133
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
It's coming

134
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:05,000
It's coming

135
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
21 seconds

136
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
It's 100,000 yen

137
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
10 seconds

138
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
You can get 100,000 yen

139
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
It's coming

140
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
It's coming

141
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Is there more?

142
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
15 seconds

143
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
A little more

144
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
It's coming

145
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
It's coming

146
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
It's coming

147
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
A little more

148
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
4 seconds

149
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
A little more

150
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:55,000
It's coming

151
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
It's a little early today

152
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
What?

153
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
The beginning

154
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I don't have any

155
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
After this

156
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I'll go to the studio at night

157
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I don't know

158
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I didn't say I wanted to go

159
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
It's not like that

160
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I'm talking to you

161
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
As the Matsumoto of downtown

162
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I'm talking to you

163
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
He's already in H-Jung

164
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I don't know

165
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I want to go with you

166
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I want to go with you

167
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I'm not H-Jung

168
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
It's really hard

169
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
You're in a hurry

170
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
You're in a hurry

171
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Are you aware of that?

172
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
What?

173
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
What?

174
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
You came here to say let's go slowly

175
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I can't be lazy

176
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
You can't be lazy

177
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
You can't be in a hurry

178
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I'm not talking about myself

179
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I don't think it's important

180
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
to make people wait

181
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I see

182
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
No

183
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I'm going to sleep

184
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
There's a reason

185
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I'm late

186
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
There's a reason

187
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I'm late

188
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Why are you so desperate?

189
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Why are you so desperate?

190
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Can you make it in time?

191
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I don't know

192
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
That's what I'm saying

193
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
There's a reason

194
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
You're late

195
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I came down

196
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I left a plastic bottle

197
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I left a plastic bottle

198
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I can't get in

199
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I can't get in

200
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I can't get in

201
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I can't get in

202
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I can't get in

203
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I can't get in

204
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I'm scared

205
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I'm scared

206
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
You're like a cat

207
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
You're like a cat

208
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
You're like a cat

209
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I went somewhere

210
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I thought it was impossible

211
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I left the building

212
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I left the building

213
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I came back and it was gone

214
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I came back and it was gone

215
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I came back and it was gone

216
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I see

217
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I'm watching

218
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I'm watching

219
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
It's already started

220
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
It's already started

221
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Of course

222
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
If you go live

223
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
You'll do something for the fans

224
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Why?

225
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I can only sing

226
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I'm not sitting where everyone is

227
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I'm not sitting where everyone is

228
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I'm like Hiromi

229
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I'm like Hiromi

230
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I'm like Hiromi

231
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I'm like Hiromi

232
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Stop

233
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Stop

234
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Young people

235
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Young people

236
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Young people

237
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Young people

238
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
You need to have a star

239
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
You need to have a star

240
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I don't really know

241
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
You show the right leg

242
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
You're needy

243
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:26,760
You're

244
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I'm not needy

245
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I'm not needy

246
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I'm not needy

247
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I have the right leg

248
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I have the right leg

249
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I know the rules

250
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I know the rules

251
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
What about the right leg

252
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:39,000
What about the right leg

253
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:39,000
What about the right leg

254
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,280
What about the right leg

255
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:40,280
It's asking for nothing

256
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:40,280
It's asking for nothing

257
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,280
Right leg

258
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Humans

259
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Humans

260
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
It seems convenient, but it isn't.

261
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
What do you mean by convenient?

262
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Your body.

263
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Yes, yes, yes.

264
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Don't you ever wonder if there's anything you can do about it?

265
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
What do you mean?

266
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
You've lived your whole life as a human being.

267
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Yes.

268
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:09,000
It would be nice if you had a pocket on your chest.

269
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
But I'm wearing clothes.

270
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Even if you're wearing clothes,

271
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,000
wouldn't it be nice if you had a little coin on your chest?

272
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Why would I have a coin on my chest when I'm naked?

273
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I have it, right?

274
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
For example, I can hide it somewhere.

275
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I can take it off when I'm doing this.

276
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
The rest is in a bag.

277
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I don't want it.

278
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I think I can have it.

279
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
For example, I can put it on my waist.

280
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I can put a key holder on it.

281
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Why would you put a key holder on your chest when you're naked?

282
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I have this on my chest.

283
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I don't have this on my face.

284
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
What would you do if you got caught?

285
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
It would be really painful.

286
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
And also, you know,

287
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
you do this with your fingers, right?

288
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
You do this at this time.

289
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
It would be nice if you had something like this.

290
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
It's dangerous when you use it.

291
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
What do you usually do with this?

292
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I do this.

293
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I don't know the face of that person.

294
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
This is the proper face.

295
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I don't need this.

296
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I don't need it.

297
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
So when you take it off, you go like this.

298
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Why do you do it automatically?

299
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I think about it in my head.

300
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I think about it in my head.

301
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
It's the same with your hands.

302
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
If you want to take it off, you take it off.

303
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
If you want to take it off, you go like this.

304
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
You go like this.

305
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Everyone says, let's put it on.

306
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
So, for example,

307
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
from tomorrow, you'll be swimming all the time.

308
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Why?

309
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Well, it doesn't matter.

310
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
You'll be swimming all the time.

311
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
And you'll have a girlfriend.

312
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
She'll be swimming all the time.

313
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I'll be swimming all the time, too.

314
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Why?

315
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Listen to me.

316
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
And you'll have sex.

317
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
You'll have a child.

318
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
And that child will be swimming all the time.

319
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Why?

320
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
And you'll meet that kind of family.

321
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Is that me?

322
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
And you'll be swimming all the time with your son.

323
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
And you'll be swimming all the time with your daughter.

324
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Of course, you'll be swimming all the time.

325
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
And when you have children,

326
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
you'll be swimming all the time.

327
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Oh, that kind of child.

328
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
So,

329
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
you'll try to do something

330
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
like you have a pocket.

331
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Right?

332
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
You'll try to do something like this.

333
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
You don't have one.

334
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Oh, I don't have one.

335
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
You don't have one.

336
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
But you'll try to do it from tomorrow or today.

337
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
And you'll marry a woman who tries to do it.

338
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Oh, me?

339
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,000
By doing that, you'll definitely have a pocket.

340
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
This is a living thing.

341
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
No, no.

342
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
When I'm swimming, I think,

343
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
maybe,

344
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
but I don't have one.

345
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I can't do it.

346
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I want two.

347
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Why?

348
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I think it's convenient.

349
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I don't think you need a pocket.

350
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I can't help it even if I do it like this.

351
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Please show me the paper.

352
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:45,000
It's deep.

353
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Of course, when you have a hard time,

354
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:54,000
you'll ride on a white horse and run around the grassland.

355
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Well, that's not the case.

356
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:00,000
You can do it next time.

357
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Why do you know that?

358
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Well, if you think so.

359
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Do you have a horse?

360
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Well,

361
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I don't have one.

362
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I love animals.

363
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
For example, I don't have a horse.

364
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
So it's not yours?

365
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Of course not.

366
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
For example, when I have a hard time,

367
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
when I meet a sad thing,

368
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
a horse will come to you.

369
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Will it come to you?

370
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Yes, it will.

371
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
In fact, animals come to me.

372
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
First, when I'm depressed.

373
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
When I'm depressed,

374
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
birds come to me.

375
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,000
They eat my microorganisms.

376
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
You're disgusting.

377
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
You're disgusting.

378
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:10,780
They eat my

379
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:12,000
microorganisms.

380
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
They eat my microorganisms.

381
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,000
They eat my microorganisms.

382
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
They eat my microorganisms.

383
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
But you didn't say that before.

384
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
You said something like,

385
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
when I say,

386
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
they come to me.

387
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
But here is a hall.

388
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Where do they come from?

389
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
They are birds, right?

390
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,000
They come to me when I'm sad.

391
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Birds come to me

392
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,000
when I'm angry.

393
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Why are birds coming to you when you're angry?

394
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,000
You're disgusting.

395
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
You're disgusting.

396
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
You're disgusting.

397
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Why do you throw a Zabuton?

398
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I'm excited.

399
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
No, that's not the answer.

400
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
No?

401
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Why?

402
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Because I can't sit down.

403
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
But you got it right.

404
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
You and I got it right.

405
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
You're annoying.

406
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:28,000
You can't get it right.

407
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
That was good.

408
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
You know,

409
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
it was good or bad

410
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
what you said when you were a geisha.

411
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,000
No.

412
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
You're always good and beautiful.

413
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
That's not true.

414
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

415
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
When I'm angry, they come to me.

416
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I don't trust anyone.

417
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I feel bad.

418
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
What do you feel bad about?

419
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I'll show you a tattoo.

420
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
No.

421
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Why do you show me a tattoo?

422
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Because I feel bad.

423
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
What?

424
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
You know,

425
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
anger is a power.

426
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
It's a power.

427
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Yes.

428
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Animals are very sensitive to such things.

429
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
When there's a disaster,

430
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
animals make a fuss.

431
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Yes.

432
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
It's the same thing.

433
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
When I'm angry,

434
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
the earth...

435
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
The earth is weird.

436
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
The earth is weird?

437
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
It's not the earth, it's the earth.

438
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
But wait a minute.

439
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
You just said everyone.

440
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Didn't you say that?

441
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I'm not the only one.

442
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
When everyone's angry, they come to me.

443
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Really?

444
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
You're the only one talking.

445
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
You're weird.

446
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
You're not always angry.

447
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
You're weird.

448
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
You're weird.

449
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Your skin is weird.

450
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
What?

451
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:01,000
You're getting old.

452
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Why do sea turtles cry when there's a disaster?

453
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
You're crying.

454
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Yes.

455
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
It must hurt.

456
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
You're crying because it hurts?

457
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
You must be moved.

458
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Because I'm giving birth to a child?

459
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
You're giving birth.

460
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Even if you give birth to a child,

461
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
it's only a few.

462
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Yes.

463
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
I'm giving birth to an egg right now,

464
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:32,000
but it's broken.

465
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I think I understand.

466
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I think so, too.

467
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Then I'll give you an answer.

468
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Why?

469
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Does that mean it's different?

470
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Don't you think you only cry when you're sad?

471
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
That's not true.

472
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
I cry when I'm moved.

473
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
You cry when you're moved.

474
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Let's think about what you cry for.

475
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
When you're sad.

476
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Yes.

477
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
When you're in pain.

478
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Yes.

479
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
When you're depressed.

480
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Yes.

481
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
And when you don't go the way you want to.

482
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Yes.

483
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
And when you're really depressed.

484
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:12,000
It's all the same.

485
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Are you ready?

486
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Yes.

487
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
There are many kinds of tears.

488
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
That's right.

489
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,000
And you say that these tears are moved tears.

490
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Tears of sadness.

491
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Both sadness and emotions are in it.

492
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
But you're saying it's different, right?

493
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I'm saying it's different.

494
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Is that so?

495
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Yes.

496
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
What's the difference?

497
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
These tears?

498
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Yes.

499
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Um, this is...

500
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:45,000
It's better to think about the time.

501
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:50,000
There's a little bit of a female cylinder.

502
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,000
There's an experimental tool.

503
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Why are you crying?

504
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Why are you crying?

505
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I'm answering that.

506
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Why is there a female cylinder?

507
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Well, let's not talk about that.

508
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,000
What do you think?

509
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I said my opinion.

510
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I said it's different.

511
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
I see.

512
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Of course.

513
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
So what is it?

514
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
What is it?

515
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
What is it?

516
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
What are you?

517
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
What are you?

518
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
What are you doing?

519
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
What are you doing?

520
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
What are you doing?

521
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

522
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,000
I don't know.

523
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
So I'm asking you to tell me.

524
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
I'm not crying because I'm moved.

525
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
I'm not crying because I'm sad.

526
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
That's right.

527
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
That's right.

528
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Why are you crying?

529
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Yes, yes, yes.

530
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Um, this is, of course,

531
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
There are various opinions and theories.

532
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:01,000
I don't think that's the right thing to do right now.

533
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Is that so?

534
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Yes.

535
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
What do you mean?

536
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Well, first of all,

537
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Dad.

538
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:20,000
You think this turtle is a female, don't you?

539
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,000
I'm asking if you cry when there's a riot.

540
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Actually, this is something I found out recently.

541
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
I'm an old man.

542
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
You're a man, aren't you?

543
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
You can't have children.

544
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Yes.

545
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,000
If you suddenly get pregnant and have a baby,

546
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:45,000
You're going to cry, aren't you?

547
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
I'm going to cry.

548
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
I cried.

549
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,000
That's right.

550
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:01,000
There's something like that.

551
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Oh, it was a man.
