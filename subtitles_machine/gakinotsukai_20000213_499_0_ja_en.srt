1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Tenjin-Yama Ski Resort

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
A place where many skiers and snowboarders gather

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The members of Gaki no Tsukai have gathered

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
The first episode of Gaki no Tsukai

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Chigichigishoku Millenium

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Slippery Slippery Charismatic Ski Resort

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
It's a bad title again

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
We're outside

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Long time no see

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Let's do something together

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
The weather is nice

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
It's nice

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
What do you think of these two?

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I don't know why they're here

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
It has nothing to do with you!

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
What an interesting reaction!

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
There's no mistake

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Today...

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
What are you doing?

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
You don't have glasses?

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
We're going to try skiing today!

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I can't do it

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
You can do it!

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
You can't do everything

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
You have to expand your scope

26
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Can you do it?

27
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
We can ski a little

28
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
We can do it

29
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Why can you do it?

30
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
6 years ago

31
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I was a reporter for a ski show

32
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Why?

33
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Why?

34
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I don't want to do it

35
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
There's a phrase I hate

36
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Why did you react to it?

37
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Whose?

38
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Aoyama's

39
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Why?

40
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Why?

41
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Can you do it?

42
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I can do it!

43
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Really?

44
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
He says he can

45
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I wore it last year

46
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Really?

47
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I was wearing it with my girlfriend

48
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I was wearing it with my girlfriend

49
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
We're going to stay like this

50
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
We're going to stay like this all day

51
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Today's final goal is...

52
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
This!

53
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Ta-da!

54
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Are you okay?

55
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
We're going to take the torch

56
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
And line up

57
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
First of all, Mr. Hamada

58
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
And me

59
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
The end part

60
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Isn't this the end part?

61
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
That's right

62
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Isn't this the end part?

63
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
This is...

64
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
What's wrong?

65
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
What's wrong with you?

66
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
If you're going to talk, talk

67
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
It's funny

68
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
What's wrong with you?

69
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
What's wrong with you?

70
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
What's wrong with you?

71
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
This program is brought to you by these sponsors

72
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Yamachan's Ski Gathering

73
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Ski Gathering

74
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Ski Gathering?

75
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
First of all

76
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Let's introduce the members of Ski Deck

77
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
First is Downtown

78
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
They've been on the board once or twice

79
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
But no one taught them

80
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
They're both amateurs

81
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Next is Kokoriko

82
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
He used to work as a reporter for a ski program for half a year

83
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
They're both quite confident

84
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
They have the ability of a heavyweight

85
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
And the two staff representatives

86
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
On the other hand, Tsuchinoto has zero experience in skiing

87
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
They're both amateurs

88
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
First of all

89
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I don't want to ski

90
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Are you ready?

91
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Why?

92
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
First of all, the cold

93
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I'm really scared of the cold

94
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Are you scared?

95
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I'm not

96
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I'm scared

97
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
But that's why everyone is dressed like this

98
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Your ears are sticking out, right?

99
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
No, they're not

100
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Your ears are sticking out a little, right?

101
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
When your ears are sticking out a little

102
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
If you leave your ears in the cold all the time

103
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
It's called a frostbite

104
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
What does that mean?

105
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
What should I do?

106
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
So please don't do that

107
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
If you have a frostbite

108
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Your ears will fall out

109
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
There aren't many people who have frostbite

110
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
There are people who go skiing

111
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Yes, there are

112
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Everyone is here

113
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
It's okay for today

114
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
It's okay for today

115
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Well, I know I'm already skiing

116
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
It's about time for a big laugh

117
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
A funny laugh

118
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Today, really

119
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
You're weird

120
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Go home

121
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
There's something I really want you to pay attention to

122
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
What is it?

123
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
This is a snowstorm

124
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
A snowstorm?

125
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Snowstorm

126
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Please pay attention to this

127
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
The weather is really nice today, right?

128
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Really

129
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
If you don't wear goggles at all

130
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
If you keep your eyes open like this

131
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
You'll get snowy eyes

132
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Your eyes will get burned

133
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
What kind of situation is it that your eyes get burned?

134
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I thought my eyes were completely red

135
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
No, it's not

136
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Why do you look like that?

137
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Why do you look like that?

138
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
My face will be like this

139
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Will you get snowy eyes?

140
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Is that a snowstorm?

141
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Is this a snowstorm?

142
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I don't want it to be like that

143
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
It's scary

144
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Is it going to be like this?

145
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
It's Jackie

146
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Snow!

147
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Snow!

148
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
First of all, what kind of way do you slide?

149
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Please ask

150
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
What?

151
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
What does that mean?

152
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
What does that mean?

153
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
For beginners like us

154
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
We just slide like this, right?

155
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
What do you call that?

156
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
It's called Bogen

157
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Ah, Bogen

158
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
We slide like this, right?

159
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
That's right

160
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
For Bogen

161
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
You slide like this

162
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
If you slide like this, you won't get hit

163
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Yes, that's right

164
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
You think so, right?

165
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
But if you slide like this, you'll be like this

166
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
What do you call that?

167
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
It's called balance

168
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Can you raise your bangs?

169
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
What's going on?

170
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
There's a lot of sweat

171
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
There's a lot of sweat

172
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Excuse me, I've only done it 3 times

173
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
What does Yukimen mean?

174
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Yukimen is

175
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Please pay attention to this

176
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Yukimen is

177
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
If you say that, it's scary

178
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
What does Yukimen mean?

179
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Mr. Heipo

180
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Yes

181
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Which one do you think is the correct answer?

182
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Falling from the buttocks

183
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
That's right

184
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Correct

185
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Even an amateur can tell

186
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
This is absolutely

187
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Falling from the buttocks

188
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I see

189
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
If you don't fall from your head, it's wrong to hold it

190
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
If you fall from your knees

191
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Your knees will get worse

192
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
It's just getting worse

193
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Your knees will get worse

194
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
If you fall from your hands

195
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Your hands will get stuck

196
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
That's why you fall from your hands, right?

197
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Please fall from your buttocks

198
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
The correct answer is number 3

199
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
The correct answer is number 3

200
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Yes

201
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Wait

202
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
How do you stop?

203
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I won't let you say anything

204
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I haven't heard how to stop

205
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I haven't heard

206
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Have you said how to stop?

207
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I haven't said it

208
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Really?

209
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I haven't said it

210
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
How do you stop?

211
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I'll hit you

212
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
It's fine

213
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:13,000
What kind of training will the members of Yamazaki who didn't do anything do?

214
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
We'll start the training

215
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Actually, I've prepared a special instructor for today

216
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Really?

217
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Mr. Fujiwara

218
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
What?

219
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Please

220
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Amazing

221
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
What is this?

222
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
You don't have a stock

223
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Amazing

224
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Is that a pig?

225
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
That's right

226
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Is that a raccoon?

227
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
That's right

228
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Amazing

229
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
What is this?

230
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
What is this pig?

231
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
It's really delicious

232
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
It's really delicious

233
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
It's really delicious

234
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
It's amazing

235
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
It's short

236
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Really?

237
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
It's short

238
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
It's called mini ski

239
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Amazing

240
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Have you been doing this for a long time?

241
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I went to a ski resort for a part-time job when I was in college

242
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Mr. Fujiwara has a 2nd class license from the All Japan Ski Association

243
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Amazing

244
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Fujiwara Hiroshi, the manager of Yoshimoto Industries, is 31 years old

245
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Is this why people are different?

246
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
He has a 2nd class license from the All Japan Ski Association

247
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
His skills are cool and dynamic

248
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:44,000
The raccoon who draws a school in silver has a powerful face

249
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Please take care of Mr. Fujiwara today

250
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Mr. Hamada

251
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Mr. Fujiwara is in a good mood

252
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Yes

253
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Today's goal is to go somewhere else

254
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
That's right

255
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I'm going to do a prank

256
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Actually, it's a lie that he's going to draw a school in silver

257
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Fujiwara, who teaches skiing, is going to do a prank

258
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
This is Hamada's regular violence

259
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Why?

260
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I'm going to show you

261
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I'm going to show you

262
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
There's no such thing as a prank

263
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
It's completely different

264
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Tanaka cried before

265
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Tanaka once made an unreasonable prank on a man

266
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
He made a man cry

267
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
It's a lie

268
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Hamada's character, who is afraid of getting cut, should also be included in Fujiwara

269
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I'm going to get cut by Fujiwara

270
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I'm going to teach you a lot

271
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I'm going to get hurt somewhere

272
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I'm going to get cut here

273
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I'm going to bite you, but I'm going to hit you

274
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Will you get hurt?

275
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
No

276
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I'm going to bite you

277
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Will you get hurt?

278
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Everyone watching TV

279
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Where and when will you get hurt?

280
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I'm going to get hurt

281
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Fujiwara is going to bully you

282
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I'm going to bully you

283
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I'm going to show you

284
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Will Hamada really get hurt?

285
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Fujiwara, who doesn't know anything, is about to start recording

286
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
First of all, I'm going to ask you to wear a ski mask

287
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
It's my first time

288
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I'm an amateur

289
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Are you okay?

290
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I'll do my best

291
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Wear a ski mask

292
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
If you wear it straight like this

293
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
It will slip in front of you

294
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
It's 90 degrees on the slope

295
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I see

296
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I see

297
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
It's better to have a ski mask

298
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:27,000
First of all, put your toes on the ski mask

299
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
If you step on the ski mask

300
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Is this okay?

301
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
It's convenient

302
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Do you know when it's not convenient?

303
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I'm a little scared

304
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I don't know if it will slip

305
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
It's slipping

306
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Are you okay?

307
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
a little

308
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Jump

309
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,000
It's 90 degrees on the slope

310
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Don't do it

311
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,000
It's terrible

312
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
It's easier to start with a warm-up exercise

313
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I'm going to do a warm-up exercise

314
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Let's do a warm-up exercise

315
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
First, stretch your muscles

316
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Relax your stiff body

317
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Are you okay?

318
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I did it

319
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Lesson 1 How to walk

320
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Walk normally

321
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Raise your knees

322
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Walk normally

323
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Straighten the board

324
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Straighten the board

325
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Like this?

326
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Next, Mazono

327
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Walk slowly

328
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I'm scared

329
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Are you okay?

330
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Yes

331
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
It's terrible

332
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Are you okay?

333
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I'm scared

334
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Yamazaki and Kokoriko are experienced

335
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
But the way is

336
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Saito, this way

337
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Saito is behind

338
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Not yet

339
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Saito

340
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:45,000
It's like a doll

341
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
It's terrible

342
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:54,000
It's terrible

343
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
What is that?

344
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I can't do it today

345
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I'll take it all

346
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Let's change direction

347
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Raise your hips

348
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,000
This is for your body

349
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Turn it over

350
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
You're going to slip

351
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,000
It's stopped if it's perpendicular to the slope

352
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Turn it over

353
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
It's too fast

354
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
It's dangerous

355
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Are you okay?

356
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
That was terrible

357
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
My neck is getting stiff

358
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Both

359
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Don't lose

360
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:00,000
It's terrible

361
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,000
What should I do?

362
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
It's okay

363
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Can you raise your stock?

364
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
You should move

365
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I'll wait for you

366
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Good luck

367
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I don't like it

368
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
The members are falling

369
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
The reason for the prank is

370
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Will they be able to do it?

371
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Lesson 2 How to stop

372
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
When you stop

373
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:55,000
You don't have to close your eyes

374
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Put your body under your hips

375
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
If you do it like this, it will stop

376
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Please slip

377
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
This is really hard

378
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:25,000
You have to push your heels out

379
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I'll do it here

380
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Kaito, please

381
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,000
The lesson is starting

382
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,000
It's dangerous

383
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Where are you going?

384
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:52,000
It's dangerous

385
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Hamada

386
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
It's perfect

387
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Matsumoto

388
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Push your heels out

389
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Like this

390
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
It's dangerous

391
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Fujiwara's lesson is starting

392
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Isn't it too fast?

393
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
You have to do it slowly

394
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
One by one

395
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Lesson 3

396
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
It's the same as before

397
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Can I stop?

398
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Can I stop?

399
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
It hurts

400
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
It's a safe weapon

401
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I'm sorry

402
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Are you serious?

403
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,000
It's okay if you get hurt

404
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:55,000
It's dangerous

405
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Kamada and Matsumoto are doing their lessons

406
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,000
They cleared the slope

407
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,000
It's okay

408
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Let's turn

409
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Turn to the right

410
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Put your weight on your left foot

411
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
You will be able to turn

412
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Can I do it?

413
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
You have to touch your shoes

414
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
What should I do?

415
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,000
What should I do?

416
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:37,000
You have to put your weight on your left foot

417
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:44,000
You have to put your weight on your left foot

418
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
You can't turn

419
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
It felt good

420
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
You have to put your weight on your left foot

421
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
You can't turn

422
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
You can't turn

423
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
You can't turn

424
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,000
You can't turn

425
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:10,000
You can't turn

426
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
What is this?

427
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Lesson 4

428
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
It's the last lesson

429
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
It's the last chance to prank Fujiwara

430
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
We didn't turn

431
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
That's impossible

432
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Fujiwara

433
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,000
It's dangerous

434
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
It's dangerous

435
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Do it slowly

436
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Is it okay if I do it slowly?

437
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Yes

438
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
There are times when you suddenly speed up

439
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
How do you do it?

440
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
If I do it like that

441
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,000
I think it's okay as long as I'm doing it here

442
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,000
It's dangerous

443
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Fujiwara is worried about the dangerousness of the lesson

444
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Matsumoto starts to slide at the perfect timing

445
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:20,000
What's going on?

446
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Matsumoto is losing balance

447
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
What's going on?

448
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
What's going on?

449
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,000
You're going in the wrong direction

450
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Danger! Danger!

451
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Are you okay?

452
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Huh?

453
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Are you okay?

454
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Huh?

455
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Ouch! Ouch!

456
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
It's hot! It's hot!

457
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Huh?

458
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
It's hot!

459
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
It's hot!

460
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Can you move your back a little?

461
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Okay.

462
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
I can't move at that speed.

463
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I think you got caught in the snow.

464
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Huh?

465
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
I think you got caught in the snow.

466
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
I can't move at that speed.

467
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
I can't move at that speed.

468
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I'm sorry.

469
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
It's hot! It's hot!

470
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
I can't move...

471
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
I think you should roll over.

472
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Can you move your back a little?

473
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
I can't move at that speed.

474
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Hey!

475
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
I'm sorry.

476
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
I'm sorry.

477
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
You should have told me earlier.

478
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Yes.

479
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
You should have told me earlier.

480
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Hey!

481
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
I'm sorry.

482
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
I'm sorry.

483
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Hey!

484
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Are you okay?

485
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Are you okay?

486
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Yes.

487
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Hey!

488
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I'm sorry.

489
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
I'm sorry.

490
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
What are you doing?

491
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Huh?

492
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Yes.

493
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Hey!

494
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
I'm sorry.

495
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
You should have told me earlier.

496
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Yes.

497
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Hey!

498
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
I'm sorry.

499
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Hey!

500
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
I'm sorry.

501
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
You should have told me earlier.

502
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Yes.

503
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
I'm sorry.

504
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
You should have told me earlier.

505
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
I'm sorry.

506
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Huh?

507
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Yes.

508
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Alright, stop it.

509
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Please stop.

510
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:32,000
I don't want to see it anymore.

511
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:41,000
It was a big success.

512
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
I wanted to see it.

513
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,000
I've been looking at it for a long time, and it was making a lot of noise.

514
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:52,000
When I saw it for the first time, I was wondering how it was going to be.

515
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,000
I don't know what kind of world he's in.

516
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:21,000
I don't know what kind of world he's in.
