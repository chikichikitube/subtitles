1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
The five men who aim for the top of the entertainment world.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Their name is...

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Osu! Ikidome-Bun!

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Masato-san, what are we doing today?

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
We are going to create a new club.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
There are many clubs in this world.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
The club that we are most good at is...

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Ikidome.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Who is good at it?

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
The five men who represent Yoshimoto.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
It's about us.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Were you sleeping?

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I was sleeping.

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Ikidome-Bun will be formed here today.

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
How many seconds can you hold your breath underwater?

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
This is the first time we are going to have a match like this.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
The leader is Yamanaki Hosei-san.

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Thank you very much.

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I am the leader.

20
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I am Yama-chan's leader.

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
No, it's simply long.

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
This is a secret weapon.

23
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Really?

24
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
You have a lot of lung capacity.

25
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Ikidome is about lung capacity.

26
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
You just said it.

27
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I said it.

28
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
You said it.

29
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
That's why I have a lot of lung capacity.

30
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I don't have to do anything.

31
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
What do you mean you don't have to do anything?

32
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I don't have to say that.

33
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I don't have to wait for my turn.

34
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I will definitely win.

35
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
However, this is the first match of the staff, so I won't bring anything half-hearted.

36
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I see.

37
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Today's opponent is a strong opponent with 3G.

38
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
That's fast.

39
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Then, let's have the memorable first opponent appear.

40
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Here you go.

41
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Come on.

42
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
It's amazing.

43
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
This is amazing.

44
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
This is completely stupid.

45
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
This is completely stupid.

46
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
This is completely stupid.

47
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
This is dangerous.

48
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
This is dangerous.

49
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Are you all right?

50
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
This is completely stupid.

51
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I'm a stupid boss.

52
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I'm a stupid boss.

53
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Why are you hiding?

54
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I was a little embarrassed.

55
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
This is a strong opponent.

56
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
This is a strong opponent.

57
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
This is a strong opponent.

58
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I'm sorry, but you're wrong.

59
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Why?

60
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I think Mizumoto is the number one in the entertainment world.

61
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
That's right.

62
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I just want you to lick my yamanaki.

63
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I will do it.

64
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I'm already a bug.

65
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
You can't do that.

66
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I will definitely win.

67
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I've had a near-death experience when Mr. Daruma fell in the water.

68
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
That's too much.

69
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
You're working too hard.

70
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I will definitely win.

71
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
You guys, too.

72
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
You can't do that seriously.

73
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
This program is provided by the sponsor you are watching.

74
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
This is a team match.

75
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
From the vanguard to the leader.

76
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
We will do it alternately.

77
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
We will eliminate the victory in the total time.

78
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Please decide the order.

79
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Let's start the game.

80
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
This is a vanguard match.

81
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Who will be the team?

82
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I'm not the strongest in the universe.

83
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Is it me?

84
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
It's me.

85
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
The universe is...

86
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
The end.

87
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Thank you.

88
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I will do it seriously.

89
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I will do it seriously.

90
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I will not lose.

91
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I will definitely not lose.

92
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I don't want to lose.

93
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
The team that came to the vanguard is JORDAN'S MIMATA.

94
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Will the hungry stomach be able to survive?

95
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
The team that came to the vanguard is MIMATA.

96
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Wait a minute.

97
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Why did you decide to go first?

98
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
That's too serious.

99
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
That's too serious.

100
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I have a record.

101
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I can't do that.

102
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I will think about it from the middle to the end.

103
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I understand.

104
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Let's go to the second half.

105
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:26,000
By the way, the world record is 8 minutes and 6 seconds.

106
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
This is the world record.

107
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Please do your best.

108
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I don't think about it later, so I can do it.

109
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I don't think about it later, so I can do it.

110
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I don't think about it later, so I can do it.

111
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I will measure the time when your face enters here.

112
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I understand.

113
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Are you ready?

114
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Yes.

115
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I will do my best.

116
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Let's go.

117
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I will do my best.

118
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Start.

119
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I will do my best.

120
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I will do my best.

121
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I will do my best.

122
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I will do my best.

123
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Why are you worried about his face?

124
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I will do my best.

125
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
You are still in the middle of the game.

126
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
What are you doing?

127
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Can you hear me?

128
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I can't see it.

129
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I can't see it.

130
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I can't see it.

131
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I can't see it.

132
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I can't see it.

133
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I can't see it.

134
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
This is not a gesture.

135
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
This is not a gesture.

136
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
What are you talking about?

137
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I don't know what you are talking about.

138
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
What are you talking about?

139
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:32,000
What are you talking about?

140
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
36 seconds.

141
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
36 seconds.

142
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
What did you say?

143
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
What did you say?

144
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
How many seconds?

145
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
You can't hear me.

146
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
36 seconds is not bad.

147
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I don't know.

148
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I don't have everyone's record.

149
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
This is the first time.

150
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
This is the first time.

151
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:56,000
The first team is Endo.

152
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I'm nervous.

153
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Relax.

154
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I'm not used to it.

155
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Let's go.

156
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Endo, get ready.

157
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Start.

158
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
He looks serious.

159
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Good.

160
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
He is concentrated.

161
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
He is concentrated.

162
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:28,000
It's good that fine bubbles are coming.

163
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Good.

164
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Good.

165
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Good.

166
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Calm down.

167
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Calm down.

168
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
It's a little dangerous.

169
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Calm down.

170
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Good.

171
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
It's not too far!

172
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Oh!

173
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Oh, no!

174
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
You got it!

175
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
You got it!

176
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
No way!

177
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
You got it!

178
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
You got it!

179
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
You got it!

180
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
You got it!

181
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
You got it!

182
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
You got it!

183
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
You got it!

184
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
You got it!

185
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
You got it!

186
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
You got it!

187
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
You got it!

188
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
You got it!

189
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Next, it's Taka-san and me.

190
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Okay!

191
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
We're going to talk about it here.

192
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
We only have 11 seconds left.

193
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
That's right.

194
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I'm sorry, but...

195
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Yeah.

196
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
We're going to have to split it up.

197
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I'm sorry, but...

198
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
The northern team, Jihou, is 45 years old.

199
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
He has a rich career and is in the top class in the entertainment world.

200
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Oh, I'm so calm.

201
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
You're calm?

202
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I feel like I'm back home.

203
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I feel calm when I come to this water tank.

204
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Okay, let's go!

205
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Ready...

206
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Go!

207
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Why are you making a refreshing face?

208
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
It's refreshing.

209
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Amazing.

210
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Amazing, amazing.

211
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
It's refreshing, but it's a little oppressive.

212
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I see.

213
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
It's time consuming.

214
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
But is it okay to open your mouth?

215
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
No, it's not.

216
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Why do you have a advertising agency?

217
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Advertising agency?

218
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Advertising agency?

219
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Wait a minute.

220
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Oh, my God.

221
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
What are you doing?

222
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Oh, my God.

223
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
It's not finished yet.

224
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
It's not finished yet.

225
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
It's not finished yet.

226
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
It's coming out of my mouth!

227
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Are you kidding me?

228
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
It's coming out of my mouth!

229
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
More!

230
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Hang in there!

231
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
It's coming out!

232
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
It's coming out!

233
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
It's coming out!

234
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
50 seconds!

235
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
One more!

236
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Wow!

237
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I wanted to get one more!

238
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Something came out of my mouth!

239
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Something came out of your mouth!

240
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
It's hard!

241
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
It's coming out of my mouth!

242
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
It's coming out of my mouth!

243
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
It's coming out of my mouth!

244
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
By the way, he's the worst in our team.

245
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I think he's probably the worst.

246
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Gaki team.

247
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Jihong is Hamada.

248
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
How far can a weak guy survive in the water?

249
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
How many seconds?

250
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I want you to say 45 seconds.

251
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I want you to say 45 seconds.

252
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Hamada was 53 seconds.

253
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I'm 42 seconds below.

254
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
If you say 45 seconds,

255
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
You can see it inside.

256
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
You can see it?

257
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Not at all.

258
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
You can't see it?

259
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
You have to wear goggles.

260
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Let me borrow your goggles.

261
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I can't take my face off with goggles on.

262
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I can't take my face off with goggles on.

263
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I can't take my face off with goggles on.

264
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
We're the reaction of the face.

265
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Hamada is a bodyguard.

266
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Mr. Hamada.

267
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Thank you in advance.

268
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Ready, start!

269
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I'm counting on you.

270
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
45 seconds.

271
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Look around you.

272
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
What?

273
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
No way.

274
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
No way.

275
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
It's weird.

276
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
It's weird.

277
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
It's just a half cut.

278
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
My ears are tingling.

279
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
It's like a man's cotton swab.

280
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I'm counting on you.

281
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
It's red in the water.

282
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
It's time.

283
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I'm sorry, but we won.

284
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Thank you for your hard work.

285
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Thank you for your hard work.

286
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
It was a good job.

287
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
It's like a child.

288
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I can't see it.

289
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I can't see it.

290
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I can't see it if it's that fast.

291
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I was trying to see it desperately.

292
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I'm sorry.

293
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I was trying to see it desperately.

294
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
It's red.

295
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I was trying to see it desperately.

296
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Next, the junior high school students are from the Gaki team.

297
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Next, the junior high school students are from the Gaki team.

298
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I want to make use of my scuba experience, but I'm worried about my weakness in the real game.

299
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I'm really looking forward to it.

300
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I'm not kidding.

301
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I'm really looking forward to it.

302
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I want to continue this down.

303
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I'm looking forward to it.

304
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I'm concentrating on it alone.

305
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I'm concentrating on it alone.

306
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Don't ask me anything.

307
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Don't ask me anything.

308
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
OK.

309
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Let's go.

310
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Are you ready?

311
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Sometimes I have an accident like this.

312
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Don't worry.

313
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
OK.

314
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I'm scared.

315
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
It's good.

316
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
It's good.

317
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I'm concentrating.

318
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I'm concentrating.

319
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I'm concentrating.

320
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I'm focusing.

321
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I'm concentrating.

322
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Not yet.

323
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Not yet.

324
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Don't do it.

325
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
No.

326
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I can't concentrate.

327
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I can't concentrate.

328
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I can't concentrate.

329
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I can't concentrate.

330
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Ok, go ahead.

331
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
31 seconds.

332
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
No way!

333
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
No way!

334
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
What the hell?

335
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I drank water.

336
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
That's terrible.

337
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Team Juken is in Jodanzui Yamazaki.

338
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
They are 180 cm tall and have a great body.

339
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Can they keep the lead?

340
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Are you ready? I'm going to do it seriously.

341
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
What did you say?

342
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
What?

343
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I'm going to show you how I do it.

344
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I'm sorry.

345
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I don't care how you do it.

346
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I just want to show you how I do it.

347
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Just show me how you do it.

348
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Just show me how you do it.

349
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Ok, let's do it.

350
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I'm going to show you how I do it.

351
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Ready.

352
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Go.

353
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
It's too big.

354
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
It's hard to see.

355
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I don't know how far it is.

356
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I'm so angry.

357
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I'm so angry.

358
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
It's dangerous.

359
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
What?

360
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Oh my god.

361
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Hey!

362
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Hey!

363
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Hey!

364
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Hey!

365
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Wait a minute!

366
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Get out!

367
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Get out!

368
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
You still have it, right?

369
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Do your best!

370
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Hey!

371
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Hey!

372
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Hey!

373
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Hey!

374
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
You can win!

375
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
You can win!

376
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
You can win!

377
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
You can win!

378
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I'm sorry.

379
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I hope you win.

380
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
You can go home.

381
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
You can win in 30 seconds.

382
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
If you have more than 30 seconds, you can win.

383
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
What should we do?

384
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
The order of our team.

385
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
If you have confidence, you can win.

386
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
You can win.

387
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
You can win.

388
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
You can win.

389
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I'm serious.

390
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
If you really do it, you can win.

391
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Let's leave it to the old man.

392
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Really?

393
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Really?

394
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Really?

395
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Excuse me.

396
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Can I do it?

397
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I'll change the order here.

398
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
What?

399
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
What?

400
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
This is the order.

401
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Wow.

402
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
It's more amazing than I thought.

403
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I'll give you a pressure.

404
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Boom!

405
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
The king of the school team, Yamazaki.

406
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
The father of Ichijino, who has absolute confidence in his son-in-law,

407
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
changes the image of a loser.

408
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
It's about time for my record.

409
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Actually, the other day,

410
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Yamazaki-san.

411
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
It was a washing machine.

412
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Yes.

413
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
About 3 minutes.

414
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
What?

415
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I think.

416
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I went inside.

417
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I was surprised by the difference in pressure between the washing machine and the water pressure.

418
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
That's.

419
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,000
If you put it out, it's like 9 seconds.

420
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Please, Yamazaki.

421
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Let's go.

422
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Oh, I just read it.

423
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
The problem is that it sinks in such a picture.

424
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
It's like taking a bath.

425
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
It's a little dangerous, so 50 seconds.

426
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Are you okay?

427
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
You're already in the water.

428
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I'll be back in 50 seconds.

429
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
There's no choice but to betray.

430
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
This is serious.

431
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
It's not funny at all.

432
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Betrayal.

433
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
It's not funny at all.

434
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Let's go, Yama-chan.

435
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Ready.

436
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Start.

437
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Then it floated.

438
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Yes.

439
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
It's more suspicious to breathe.

440
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Yes.

441
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Oh, it's already stuck.

442
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Look, look, look.

443
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
It's okay.

444
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
From here.

445
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
From here.

446
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
It's different from a sleeper.

447
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
It's better to raise your head, but it hurts.

448
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
That's right.

449
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Oh, look, look.

450
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I'm not going to be able to afford it.

451
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
It's okay.

452
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
It's okay.

453
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
This is bad.

454
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Are you crying?

455
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I'm crying in the water.

456
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I'm crying.

457
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I'm crying.

458
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I'm crying.

459
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I'm crying.

460
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I'm crying.

461
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I'm crying.

462
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I'm crying.

463
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I'm crying.

464
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I'm crying.

465
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I'm crying.

466
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I'm crying.

467
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I'm crying.

468
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I'm crying.

469
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
It's already 50.

470
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

471
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Look at my eye.

472
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
It's NYX!

473
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
It's NYX!

474
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
It's here!

475
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
It's great!

476
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
One minute.

477
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
It's here.

478
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
It's our chance, our time.

479
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
That's great!

480
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
That's one minute.

481
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
It's great.

482
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
1 minute 10 seconds.

483
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
What?

484
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Zaku-san, do your best!

485
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Apologize!

486
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Zaku-san, do your best!

487
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
All of a sudden?

488
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
You look like Kyogenji!

489
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Amazing!

490
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
That was amazing!

491
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Amazing!

492
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
That was amazing!

493
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
You were amazing!

494
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
You were completely defeated.

495
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
You were one minute ahead.

496
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
1 minute and 4 seconds.

497
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
1 minute and 4 seconds.

498
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
You have one minute.

499
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
You can win.

500
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
You can win.

501
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Yamazaki, you are amazing!

502
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
That was amazing!

503
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Amazing!

504
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
The Gaki team has a good ace.

505
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
That was amazing!

506
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
You were suddenly defeated.

507
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I was suddenly defeated.

508
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I died once.

509
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
You were completely defeated.

510
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
You were completely defeated.

511
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
You were amazing.

512
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
You were suddenly defeated.

513
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
You were completely defeated.

514
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
You were completely defeated.

515
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
You were completely defeated.

516
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
The Tsukishou from the northern team is the second best in bench press.

517
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
The Tsukishou from the northern team is the second best in bench press.

518
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
The well-trained body shows an evolution.

519
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Are you ready?

520
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Ready?

521
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Ready?

522
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Go!

523
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Here it comes.

524
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
What is this?

525
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Look at this.

526
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
You're so fast.

527
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
You're so fast.

528
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
But he's still doing it.

529
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
He's still doing it.

530
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
You can still do it.

531
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
You're getting close.

532
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
You're so fast.

533
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
You're so fast.

534
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
This is bad.

535
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
You're getting close.

536
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
You're getting close to your father.

537
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
You're not good.

538
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Hey!

539
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Hey!

540
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
You're getting close.

541
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
You're not good.

542
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
You're getting close.

543
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
What is this?

544
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Mark from Anies Bay.

545
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Not yet.

546
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Not yet.

547
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Not yet.

548
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Not yet.

549
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
A little more.

550
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
He's still doing it.

551
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
A little more.

552
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
He's still doing it.

553
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
You can do it.

554
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
You're getting close.

555
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Just a little bit more.

556
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
You're doing it.

557
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
You're getting close.

558
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
You've got one minute left.

559
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
He's doing it.

560
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Just one more minute.

561
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Just a little more!

562
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Just a little more!

563
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Wow!

564
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Wow!

565
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Oh my god!

566
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Oh my god!

567
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Oh my god!

568
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Wow!

569
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Wow!

570
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Wow!

571
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Wow!

572
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Wow!

573
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Wow!

574
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Wow!

575
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Wow!

576
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Wow!

577
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Wow!

578
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Wow!

579
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Wow!

580
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Yes...

581
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Yes...

582
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Класс, spiral!

583
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Yay!

584
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Good work, guys!

585
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Finally, let's find the winner!!

586
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Let's find the winner!!

587
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
That's how they are looking for members of Great Gida!

588
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
That's how they are looking of members of Great Gida!

589
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Ready, start!!

590
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
ugs!

591
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Please stop!

592
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
These pictures are not allowed!

593
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Ahahaha…

594
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:17,000
I can't move at all.

595
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:22,000
This is not good.

596
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,000
He's coming back.

597
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,000
He did it!

598
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
He did it!

599
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
He definitely got it.

600
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
That's the only thing you could do?

601
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
I'm really sorry.

602
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
I've been doing this for a long time.

603
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
That's right.

604
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
What should I do?

605
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
It's a subtle second.

606
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
You can do it.

607
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
46 seconds.

608
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
You can do it.

609
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
You can do it.

610
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
It's different.

611
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
That's right.

612
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
It's subtle.

613
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Do you have any advice?

614
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
No, I don't.

615
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Wait! Wait!

616
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
The target is Matsumoto.

617
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Will he be able to reverse the difference of 14 seconds in the pressure?

618
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
He's really good.

619
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
He's really good.

620
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:22,000
But he couldn't swim 25 meters in the water.

621
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:28,000
He might have jumped out of the water with his eyes rather than wearing goggles.

622
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
It's hot.

623
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,000
It's okay. It's okay.

624
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
There are a lot of galleries.

625
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
I'm nervous.

626
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Relax.

627
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
46 seconds.

628
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
46 seconds.

629
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
46 seconds is a long time.

630
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
It's 30 seconds.

631
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
It's impossible.

632
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:52,000
I'll do it in 30 seconds.

633
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
You have great pressure.

634
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
That's right.

635
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
That's good.

636
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
What's with the rubber band?

637
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Here we go.

638
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Here we go.

639
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Here we go.

640
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I'm counting on you.

641
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Ready.

642
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Go.

643
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
He's being cornered.

644
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Okay.

645
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
He can't do anything.

646
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
What kind of face is this?

647
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
It's like a wax doll.

648
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
It's like a wax doll.

649
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
It's okay.

650
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
It's really stable.

651
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Why is it so stable?

652
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
It's 30 seconds.

653
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,000
It comes quickly.

654
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
It's really stable.

655
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Why is it so stable?

656
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
It's 30 seconds.

657
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
It comes quickly.

658
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,800
Yama-chan, you're suddenly getting...

659
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:00,800
Hey, hey!

660
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:01,800
Hey, Kanasawa!

661
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:02,800
WHAAAAAAAAT?!

662
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:03,800
WHAAAAAAAAT?!

663
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:06,800
Wait, wait!

664
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:07,800
Wait, wait!

665
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:08,800
Wait, wait!

666
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,800
Wait, wait!

667
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:10,800
Wait, wait!

668
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:11,800
Wait, wait!

669
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:12,800
Wait, wait!

670
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:13,800
WHAAAAAAAAAT?!

671
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:14,800
WHAAAAAAAAAT?!

672
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:15,800
WAIT!

673
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:16,800
WHAAAAAAAAAT?!

674
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:17,800
OOOOOH!!!

675
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:18,800
That's close!

676
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:19,800
OOOOOH!!!

677
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:20,800
OOOOOH!!!

678
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:21,800
Close!!

679
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:22,800
OOOOOH!!!

680
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:23,800
Close!!

681
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:24,800
OOOOOH!!!

682
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:25,800
That was close!

683
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:26,800
You had 4 seconds left!!

684
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,800
That was close!

685
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,800
That was close!

686
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,800
It's a tie!

687
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,800
Matsumoto-san, thank you!

688
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,800
I'm a bit frustrated!

689
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,800
I'm a bit frustrated!

690
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,800
3 minutes and 55 seconds vs 3 minutes and 51 seconds!

691
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,800
The one who drinks too much wins!

692
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,800
The one who drinks too much wins!

693
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,800
The one who drinks too much wins!

694
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,800
Let's do a rematch!

695
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,800
Let's do a rematch!

696
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,800
Of course, let's do it!

697
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,800
Can I accept this?

698
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,800
Of course, let's do it!

699
00:23:56,800 --> 00:24:00,800
We were serious today, but I think they'll be serious next time.

700
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,800
Let's do a special training!

701
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,800
Let's do a special training!

702
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,800
I'm glad it was 13 seconds.

703
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,800
To be honest, we were like that too.

704
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,800
Even if it was 15 seconds.

705
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,800
Even if it was 15 seconds.

706
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,800
Even if it was 15 seconds.

707
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,800
Even if it was 15 seconds.

708
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,800
Even if it was 15 seconds.

709
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,800
Even if it was 15 seconds.

710
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:24,800
This program was provided by the following sponsors.
