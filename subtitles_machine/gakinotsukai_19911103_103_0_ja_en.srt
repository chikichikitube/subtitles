1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Thank you!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Awesome!

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
It's amazing, when it's golden, it's colored!

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
The plate is colored too!

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The plate is colored!

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
It used to be!

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
It used to be white, but now it's colored!

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
It used to be colored, but now it's colored!

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
It's not like that!

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
If you look at it, it's a child.

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Ah...

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
The two of us,

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
we did a lot of changes.

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
That's right.

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
What will happen to the child?

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Isn't it weak?

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I see.

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
When we were born,

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Japan was still a burning field.

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
There was nothing.

21
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Today there are four men and two women,

22
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
but there is one more man.

23
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Ah, is that so?

24
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Toshihide-kun is...

25
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Toshihide-kun!

26
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Don't forget your name tag!

27
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Chibikko-kun!

28
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Please say your name.

29
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm Ruge Daichi.

30
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
What?

31
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm Ruge Daichi.

32
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Ruge Daichi?

33
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Are you Chinese?

34
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
What?

35
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Ruge Daichi!

36
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
What are you scared of?

37
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm scared of E.T.

38
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm scared of E.T.

39
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
What?

40
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm scared of E.T.

41
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm scared of E.T.

42
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm scared of E.T.

43
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm scared of E.T.

44
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
It's there but I don't want to say it.

45
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
It's there but you don't wanna say it?

46
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Tell them your name!

47
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I know the name, but not the face.

48
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
You love people who knows not the face.

49
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Ah, you're on Telekura!

50
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Ah, you're on Telekura!

51
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Ah, you're on Telekura!

52
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Ah, you're on Telekura!

53
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Ah, you're on Telekura!

54
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Ah, you're on Telekura!

55
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Yui-chan, Yui-chan, Yui-chan!

56
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
You guys are still on Telekura!

57
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
What's going on?

58
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I wonder if someone's going to cry?

59
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Now, Masumoto-kun, go ahead!

60
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Nagato is a house!

61
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Nagato is a house!

62
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,000
He's crying! He's crying! He's crying!

63
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Nagato is a house!

64
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Nagato is a house!

65
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

66
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I knew it! I knew it!

67
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Ladies and gentlemen!

68
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
It's a beautiful place, isn't it?

69
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
It's my first time at a hall.

70
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
It's your first time at a hall, isn't it?

71
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Today, there's an old lady who looks like Geronimo.

72
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,000
It's that thing, isn't it? What is it?

73
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Is it the baseball Japan series?

74
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
It was all over the place, wasn't it?

75
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Yeah, the west team won, right?

76
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I can't always say that, but there are only 6-9 teams.

77
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
If it's a line, it's a line.

78
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
There are only 6-9 teams, so they win once every 6 years.

79
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
There's a good chance.

80
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
There's no such thing as a big deal.

81
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
But you can't win once, can you?

82
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Look at this superstar.

83
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
He's running through the comedian world, and he's better than me.

84
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I want to win, but there's a guy who's crying.

85
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I've been working hard for a year.

86
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Are you stupid?

87
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
It doesn't matter if you're a player or not.

88
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
There's a guy who's crying because you're supporting him.

89
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
That's because I've been working hard to support him.

90
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
For example, for example,

91
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Oh, it's blinking. I can still do this.

92
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
From the other side,

93
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I drank a little too much yesterday.

94
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Are you okay?

95
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Thank you very much.

96
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Even your name is Akiyama of the west team.

97
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
If that's the case, I'll...

98
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
That's long.

99
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I'm sorry.

100
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I went to the store.

101
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I thought it would be too much if I went any further.

102
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I went in a little too early.

103
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I went to the hospital next door, so I had to sleep for about an hour.

104
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
The funny thing about the disease is that I have a runny nose.

105
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,000
It's like a runny nose syndrome.

106
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
When you say it.

107
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
When you say it.

108
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
That's funny, isn't it?

109
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I always have a runny nose.

110
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Do you have a runny nose?

111
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
No, I threw it away.

112
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Where?

113
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Like this.

114
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Who's going to take that garbage?

115
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
The old man comes every morning.

116
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
What? The old man comes?

117
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
The old man is going to take the garbage?

118
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Of course.

119
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I don't need it.

120
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
It's raw garbage.

121
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
No way.

122
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Idiot.

123
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
What are you going to do with the old man's hair?

124
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I'm going to cut it off and leave the old man wearing it.

125
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
By the time you go home, you're going to be thrown away in a garbage bag.

126
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
You're looking at it, aren't you?

127
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
While paying money.

128
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I think.

129
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Why is the human nose in a place like this?

130
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
In order to be in a place like this.

131
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
It smells when you eat it.

132
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
There are things that smell but taste good.

133
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:52,000
There are things that you want to lick but can't because they smell bad.

134
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:58,000
If your nose is in a place like this, it's OK.

135
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,000
You can lick it.

136
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
What are you thinking?

137
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
It doesn't matter where the smell is.

138
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
It doesn't matter.

139
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,000
If your nose is in a place like this and you lick it with your mouth, does it smell bad?

140
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I don't know what you're doing.

141
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
What kind of woman are you with?

142
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I don't need my nose here.

143
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I like my nose here.

144
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
But what's here?

145
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
It's lonely here.

146
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,000
It's lonely here, so the balance is bad.

147
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Where should I put my hair?

148
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Is there anything here?

149
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
What's this?

150
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Why are you putting your hair in a place like this?

151
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
It's lonely.

152
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
It's in the way.

153
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Why?

154
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
It's in the way when you do something.

155
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
That's not true.

156
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I want you to put something here when you wash your body.

157
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
If my nose is in a place like this?

158
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
If my nose is in a place like this?

159
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
That's what I think.

160
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,000
There's a nose here, but there's another nose.

161
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
When you take a bath, it's a different nose.

162
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
This nose doesn't function.

163
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
It's closed.

164
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Where's the other nose?

165
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:35,000
This nose looks good on you when you wear a kimono.

166
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Where did you go?

167
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I went to the hospital.

168
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Where do you want to go?

169
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
That's good.

170
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I should go once.

171
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
But I'm scared.

172
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
What do you like?

173
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Do you like CT scan?

174
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
You can see half of your face.

175
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I'm scared.

176
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
If you call me,

177
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I don't know what to do.

178
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I don't know what to do if there's something in my nose.

179
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
When I was a kid,

180
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
when I rode a bicycle,

181
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
there was a bee in my nose.

182
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I went in, but I don't remember it coming out.

183
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I know.

184
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
There was a bee or a bug.

185
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I went in, but I don't remember it coming out.

186
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Maybe it's somewhere.

187
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I don't know if it's somewhere.

188
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
It's dead inside.

189
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
So it's definitely in my body.

190
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
As a difference.

191
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
It won't come out?

192
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I didn't go in from here.

193
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
It won't come out.

194
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
It's somewhere around there.

195
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
For sure.

196
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Let's say you went in from here.

197
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I went in from here.

198
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I went up once.

199
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Is it decided?

200
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
It's decided.

201
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
When you go in, you go up.

202
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I didn't know that.

203
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Why?

204
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I went up.

205
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
And then you go back.

206
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
And then you go back.

207
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I'm already there.

208
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
From here.

209
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
And then you go back.

210
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
And then you go back.

211
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
It's different.

212
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I'm going back.

213
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
And then you go back.

214
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
And then you go back.

215
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
And then you go back.

216
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I'm already there.

217
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I was thinking if I should make it shorter.

218
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I see.

219
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I should cut it here.

220
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:42,000
It's pretty funny.

221
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I don't know where to start.

222
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:52,000
What are you doing at home?

223
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
What kind of woman are you?

224
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
What?

225
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
What kind of woman are you?

226
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
What do you mean by woman?

227
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I have a wife.

228
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:16,000
That's enough.

229
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Do you have a girlfriend?

230
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I don't have a girlfriend right now.

231
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I'm looking for a girlfriend right now.

232
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I'm looking for a girlfriend right now.

233
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
What kind of woman are you?

234
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I'm not married.

235
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
It's not funny at all.

236
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
It's funny, but it's funny.

237
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I'm married, but when I do that...

238
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
It's funny.

239
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Who is that?

240
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I'm from Toshima.

241
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I came to Tokyo from Osaka in April.

242
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I have a question.

243
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
When I'm driving on the streets of Tokyo,

244
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
there are a lot of people who drive open cars.

245
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Oh, there are.

246
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
The roads are more crowded than Osaka.

247
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
When I look at the open cars that are moving slowly in the parking lot,

248
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
people are staring at me.

249
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I don't think it's cool at all.

250
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Do you want to buy an open car?

251
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I don't think so.

252
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
You don't think so?

253
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Why?

254
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
It's like a toy.

255
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
What are you crazy about?

256
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
That kind of car.

257
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Do you want an open car?

258
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
The other day, when I was driving with Nitta,

259
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
there was something a little old-fashioned in the open car.

260
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Something like,

261
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
we don't have a tomorrow.

262
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Something like that.

263
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Right?

264
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
It's not a car like that,

265
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
but look at the back.

266
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
There's something like a basket in the back.

267
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Yes, yes, yes.

268
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
It's like when you go on a picnic.

269
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
It's really like,

270
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
it's like you're driving on a park in America.

271
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
It's really tacky.

272
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,000
That's not it!

273
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
It's like you're in a mountain.

274
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
No,

275
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I think that

276
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
if the driver gets in, it's fine.

277
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
What do you mean, if the driver gets in?

278
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
The guy I saw the other day was in an open car,

279
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
but he's bald.

280
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Bald people don't get in an open car.

281
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
It's a part that you can hide.

282
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
If there's a roof, you can't tell if you're bald.

283
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Why?

284
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
You're not wearing a hat.

285
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I'm not wearing a hat.

286
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
You can't wear a hat in an open car.

287
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
The hat will fly.

288
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
You can't wear a hat.

289
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
You have to wear rubber.

290
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
There are bald people who are cool.

291
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
What?

292
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Cool bald people?

293
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
What kind of bald people?

294
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
There are bald people like Takenaga-san.

295
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Like Takenaga Nao-san.

296
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
There are bald people like that.

297
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I think it suits you because you're that person.

298
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Right?

299
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
You're really like that.

300
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
What kind of bald people?

301
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
You don't like people who are ugly, right?

302
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
That's right.

303
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
If you're like that, you should cut your hair.

304
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
You're so forceful.

305
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
You're like this.

306
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
That's strange.

307
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I'm saying it's fine here.

308
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
It's fine. You're like this.

309
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
You're like this.

310
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
You're thinking about all kinds of things.

311
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I've seen this before.

312
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
There's only this and this.

313
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I'm folding this.

314
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Like this.

315
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
It's really like a present.

316
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Like this.

317
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
What's worse is that...

318
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
You're folding it like a pie.

319
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
It's long.

320
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
It's like when you fold your pants.

321
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
There are people like that.

322
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
You only fold this part.

323
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
You don't fold this part.

324
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
You only fold this part.

325
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
It's fine.

326
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
There's that part earlier, but here...

327
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
You're like this.

328
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
You're like this.

329
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I can't help it.

330
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I'm going to extend it and fold it.

331
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Like this.

332
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I'm going to drill this part open.

333
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I'm going to drill this part through and make a hole here.

334
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I'm going to pull it out from here.

335
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
It's strange.

336
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
There's a bunch of hair in a place like this.

337
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
It looks strange.

338
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Is it strange?

339
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
There's a lot of hair here.

340
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,000
There's a bunch of hair in your face.

341
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I was watching TV the other day and thought of something.

342
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
At the end of the news, there's the Dao Heikin Kabuka.

343
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Dao Heikin Kabuka.

344
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
What is that?

345
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Let's think about it together.

346
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Let's think about it together.

347
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Da...

348
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Da...

349
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I'm sorry.

350
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
What is Dao?

351
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I don't know what Dao Heikin Kabuka is.

352
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
What is it?

353
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
What is it?

354
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
So...

355
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
For a while...

356
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
My bubble burst.

357
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Please explain what a bubble is.

358
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Please explain what a bubble is.

359
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
The land was going up.

360
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Do you understand?

361
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I understand.

362
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
The land was going up.

363
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Then the real estate company went to that direction.

364
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
What is that?

365
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Japan is the real estate company's country.

366
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
At that time,

367
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Wait!

368
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,000
That bubble burst.

369
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Don't you think you're acting like a hero?

370
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I think this is easier for you guys to understand.

371
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Wait!

372
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
The bubble burst.

373
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
It hurts.

374
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
The bubble burst.

375
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Who is it?

376
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Wait!

377
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Go ahead.

378
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Who are you fighting with?

379
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:33,000
The real estate company.

380
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,000
That's it.

381
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
There are many schools nowadays.

382
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,000
For example, there is a school called Yumo-wa Wajitsu Koza.

383
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:48,000
It's a school that can capture people's hearts.

384
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
It's said that anything can be a school.

385
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
What kind of school do you think will be popular?

386
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Did you go to school?

387
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
When I was little?

388
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Solo class or calligraphy class?

389
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
That's not good.

390
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
What did you say?

391
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
You didn't say anything.

392
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Everyone said that.

393
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
That's right.

394
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
That's why I didn't want to go.

395
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
What's that?

396
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:15,000
What did you do when everyone was drunk and went to the solo class after school?

397
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I played with the marbles.

398
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
That's not cool.

399
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
That's sad.

400
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
What did you eat?

401
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I ate tebasaki.

402
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Everyone was going to the solo class, but you ate tebasaki.

403
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
That's not good.

404
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
That's not good.

405
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
It's a classroom.

406
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
It's a place to fix the marbles.

407
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
That's a lie.

408
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
It's a place to fix the marbles.

409
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,000
It's a place where people from the countryside teach you the standard language.

410
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
The word standard language makes me angry.

411
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
What kind of standard language are you talking about?

412
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
What?

413
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
It's a way to treat people from Tokyo.

414
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Everyone in Tokyo is a person from Tokyo.

415
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
That's right.

416
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
There are almost no people from Tokyo.

417
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Most of them are from the countryside, right?

418
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Yes.

419
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
They are all from Tokyo.

420
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
When they go home, they all say, zura.

421
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
It's true.

422
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:22,000
If you say, I'm from Tokyo, they'll think you're from the Philippines.

423
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I'm proud of my Osaka dialect.

424
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:31,000
If you start a Osaka dialect class, you might be able to enter the class in Tokyo.

425
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Because of the intonation.

426
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
If you don't want to say bad things, you should start a Osaka dialect class.

427
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Right?

428
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
You'll be able to understand, right?

429
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Yes, I'll understand.

430
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
It's cold.

431
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
It's not cold at all.

432
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
It's not cold at all.

433
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I can't understand.

434
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
It's really cold.

435
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
It looks really cold.

436
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
It looks cold.

437
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
I'm going to die.

438
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
You think so, right?

439
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:04,000
My stomach is not feeling well.

440
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
My stomach is not feeling well.

441
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
I have a cold.

442
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,000
It's not about the expression.

443
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
What is this?

444
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
It's good.

445
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
It's good.

446
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I don't want it.

447
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
It's good.

448
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
It's good.

449
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
It's good.

450
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
It's good.

451
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
It's good.

452
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
It's good.

453
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
It's good.

454
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
It's good, right?

455
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
It's good.

456
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
It's good, right?

457
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
It's good.

458
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
You can buy the same one, right?

459
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Where did they get the same one?

460
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Where did they get the same one?

461
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:45,000
I'm still different.

462
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I'm a bit different from Kappa's mother.

463
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Good evening.

464
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Good evening.

465
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Right, we've finished today.

466
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
We did it, didn't we?

467
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:14,000
People who haven't been able to see it before should be able to see it now that the time has changed, so I'd like to ask you for your opinion on it.

468
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Please let me know.

469
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Other than that, well, I guess that's it.

470
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Yesterday, my nose was clogged and it was hard to sleep.

471
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:43,000
If it's clogged here, it's clogged here too.

472
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:48,000
I'm not going to do it.

473
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
I'll take care of everything.

474
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
And I'm waiting for you to use my hall.

475
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
For free.

476
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
For free.

477
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:02,000
I'm waiting for you to use my hall.

478
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:07,000
I'm waiting for you to use my hall.

479
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
So, what are you going to do?

480
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
For free.
