1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
I'm Nitta, the child's servant.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I'm Nitta the coordinated thief!

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Today we're going to coordinate with Nitta.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I'm getting tired of that costume.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
It's not funny at all.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Do you have it?

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Yes.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
This 20,000 yen you gave me.

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
20,000 yen.

10
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I have 20,000 yen each.

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
We're going to buy it again.

12
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
We'll take 20 minutes to find Nitta's clothes.

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
That's right.

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Let's call Nitta.

15
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Nitta-kun.

16
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Yes.

17
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
You don't like it?

18
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
No, no.

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Say more.

20
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Yes.

21
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Nitta also wore this costume when he was in 6th grade.

22
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
He was wearing a lot of clothes.

23
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Finally, this is graduation.

24
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm going to be a manager from today.

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
When he came in this costume, I was shocked.

26
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
What kind of coordination do you want?

27
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I want him to be cool.

28
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I want him to look good in this costume.

29
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
You're talking too much.

30
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Don't talk too much.

31
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm going to coordinate with Nitta for 20 minutes.

32
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I don't like women's costumes, but I'll try it on.

33
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
This costume is made of fabric.

34
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,000
It's wrapped around my body like an Indian.

35
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
It's called French Ligarage.

36
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
It's called French Ligarage.

37
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
It's 1,900 yen.

38
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
It's the same as underwear, but it's only 20,000 yen.

39
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
How much is the fabric alone?

40
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
It's more than 200,000 yen.

41
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
It's only 20,000 yen.

42
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Do you have any pants?

43
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Do you have any flashy pants?

44
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Anyone can wear this.

45
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I'm hungry.

46
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Let's go.

47
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I'm hungry.

48
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I'm hungry.

49
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Do you have 240 yen?

50
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I wonder what Hamada is going to do.

51
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
B21.

52
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
That's not it.

53
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Thank you very much.

54
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I'll do my best for B21.

55
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Thank you very much.

56
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Now, let's announce the winner.

57
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
You're taking too long.

58
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
You're taking too long.

59
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I don't care how long it takes.

60
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I want you to see the Nitta I've been working on.

61
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I've been working on it.

62
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I want you to look at me from the side.

63
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Nitta, please come out.

64
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Thank you very much.

65
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Is this really 20,000 yen?

66
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I only have 240 yen.

67
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:21,000
That's cool.

68
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
It looks similar.

69
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I don't think we'll be able to say what time it is tomorrow.

70
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I wonder what time it is tomorrow.

71
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I think I'm going to hear it from below.

72
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,000
If you turn it around, it's Midranger.

73
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,000
It's like before I die.

74
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I wanted to buy a white enamel because there were two of us.

75
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I've done my best so far.

76
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I wanted a light one.

77
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I wanted a light one.

78
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I've done my best for 20,000 yen.

79
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
What Nitta have you completed so far?

80
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I don't have that kind of money.

81
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
You don't have it, do you?

82
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I don't have that kind of money.

83
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I think I'm going to be strong in the countryside.

84
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I think I'm going to be strong in the countryside.

85
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I think I'm going to be strong in the countryside.

86
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I helped Nitta a lot.

87
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Nitta was so happy that she looked in the mirror and said,

88
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Is this really me?

89
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
That's how she reacted.

90
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Why are you so beautiful?

91
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I don't know what to say.

92
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I left the Egyptian atmosphere.

93
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
You left the Egyptian atmosphere?

94
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I left the Egyptian atmosphere.

95
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I think I'll be able to become a face even if I go to a disco.

96
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I see.

97
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I'll look forward to it.

98
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Let's see Mazumoto's performance.

99
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Let's see Mazumoto's performance.

100
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
What is this?

101
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
You're so cool.

102
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Isn't this a patch?

103
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
You're wearing a patch on your head.

104
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
You're wearing a patch on your head.

105
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
This is what a grandmother wears at home.

106
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
This is what a grandmother wears at home.

107
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
This is not good.

108
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Is this pants?

109
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
This is fashionable.

110
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
This is also about the grandmother.

111
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
This is her clothes.

112
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
This is cool.

113
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
This tie is about the same.

114
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
This is also about the same.

115
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I want to say the truth.

116
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
It's just 20,000 yen.

117
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I see.

118
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
That's perfect.

119
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Who is this?

120
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
There are two.

121
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Which one will you choose from now on?

122
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Which one? Which one should I choose?

123
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
This one.

124
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Not this one.

125
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
This one.

126
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Not this one.

127
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
You were laughing too much.

128
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Why did you do that?

129
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I thought there was a big gap.

130
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I thought you were into it.

131
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I thought you were being tricked.

132
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
If it was that one, I thought it was pretty serious.

133
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,000
So, the first Nitta coordinate was chosen by Masumoto-kun.

134
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
This one!

135
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I don't know how many episodes will be shown this time.

136
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I don't know how many episodes will be shown this time.

137
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I don't know how many episodes will be shown this time.

138
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
So, the first Nitta coordinate was chosen by Masumoto-kun.

139
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Congratulations!

140
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Hello.

141
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Today is going to be tough.

142
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
What is?

143
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Today is going to be tough.

144
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
What is?

145
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
We don't have much time left.

146
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
You were like that the other day too.

147
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
You were like, let's go home.

148
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
That's right. I talked too fast and went home too fast.

149
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I don't mind.

150
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I don't mind.

151
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
But we have a schedule for the show.

152
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
It's a 30-minute show.

153
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
The show is about 24 minutes long.

154
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
That's right.

155
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
So, you have to talk for 24 minutes.

156
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I know.

157
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
So, if I don't have much time left and I go home,

158
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I'll be the only one who can talk.

159
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Why?

160
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
The other day, you got cut by the delivery guy.

161
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
That's right. The Sushi restaurant incident in Hamadake.

162
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
The Sushi restaurant guy in Tokyo was angry.

163
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
He was late, so he took the sushi.

164
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
He was late, so he took the sushi.

165
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I said, okay.

166
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I said, okay.

167
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I said, okay.

168
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I said, okay.

169
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I said, okay.

170
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I waited.

171
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
40 minutes passed.

172
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
The Sushi restaurant guy said,

173
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I don't know if I'm on the right path.

174
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I'm going home.

175
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Call me again.

176
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I called him.

177
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
He said, I don't know.

178
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
He said, I don't know.

179
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
He went home.

180
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I said, please go this way.

181
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I said, okay.

182
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
20 minutes passed.

183
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I said, I'm going home.

184
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Call me again.

185
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
He called me again.

186
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
He said, I don't know.

187
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
This is how he is.

188
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I don't know.

189
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I don't know.

190
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
It's not that I don't know.

191
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
His customer is waiting for him.

192
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
He lied.

193
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
So, we're just going to eat together.

194
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Yes.

195
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Why don't you two make rice for your wife?

196
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
That brainless...

197
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Please forgive me. It was late at night.

198
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
This is the third time.

199
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I really don't know.

200
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
The guest is doing it again.

201
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Please do something like that.

202
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I said while watching TV.

203
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I don't know. I don't know.

204
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I said while watching TV.

205
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I said, I'm done with you.

206
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
He said that.

207
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
He also has a bad mouth.

208
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I said, I'm done with you.

209
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
What is it?

210
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I said, I'm done with you.

211
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
The couple with the reverse seat.

212
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,000
The light went down and the couple didn't come out.

213
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I knew it, but I waited on the table until they came out.

214
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
For about five minutes.

215
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
The couple was nervous.

216
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Where are you?

217
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I went to the toilet.

218
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I'm not going to the toilet.

219
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
They came out for about five minutes.

220
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
The couple was nervous.

221
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I thought they came out.

222
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Are you kidding me?

223
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
It's a code lesson.

224
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Are you kidding me?

225
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Hey!

226
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
You don't know the way.

227
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Why are you making a fuss?

228
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Then I'll do a hundred jobs over there.

229
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,000
What do you think?

230
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Laugh out loud.

231
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Laugh out loud.

232
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
You don't know the way.

233
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Why are you making a fuss?

234
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Laugh out loud.

235
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Laugh out loud.

236
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Laugh out loud.

237
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
You don't know the way.

238
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Why are you making a fuss?

239
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Laugh out loud.

240
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

241
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Then I'm sorry.

242
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Are you kidding me?

243
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Are you kidding me?

244
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

245
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
You're still talking.

246
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I'm still talking.

247
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
This is my hand.

248
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I'm on TV.

249
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
What are you talking about?

250
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I'm on TV.

251
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I'm on TV.

252
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I'm on TV.

253
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I'm on TV.

254
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I'm on TV.

255
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I'm on TV.

256
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I'm on TV.

257
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I'm on TV.

258
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I'm on TV.

259
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I'm on TV.

260
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I'm on TV.

261
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I'm on TV.

262
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I'm on TV.

263
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I'm on TV.

264
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I'm on TV.

265
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I'm on TV.

266
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I'm on TV.

267
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Let's do it now.

268
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Let's do it now.

269
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I didn't tell him anything.

270
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
He just told me in one try.

271
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
It can't be done.

272
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
He started were Piglet's place.

273
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I asked him why he didn't kill her.

274
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
You were in a taxi, right?

275
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I was eating rice.

276
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I don't know if it was a freshly eaten rice or something.

277
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I was eating rice.

278
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
You were eating rice.

279
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I was eating rice.

280
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I was eating rice.

281
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I was eating rice.

282
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
When I got in, I was going back and forth.

283
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
You were taking a break, right?

284
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
You were eating rice.

285
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Yes.

286
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Your legs were like a baka-bon-papa.

287
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
That was delicious.

288
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
You were in a taxi, right?

289
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
You were taking a break, right?

290
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
You were taking a break, right?

291
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Your legs were like a baka-bon-papa.

292
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
That was delicious.

293
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
You were like a baka-bon-papa.

294
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
You were taking a break, right?

295
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
When I asked him if he knew what he was doing,

296
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I was a little confused.

297
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I was a little confused.

298
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
You know what I mean.

299
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,000
You're sighing.

300
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I don't want to. I don't want to ride it.

301
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
You don't want to.

302
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
You wanted to take a break.

303
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
This is my luggage.

304
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
That's right.

305
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
You wanted to take a break a little more.

306
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
That's right.

307
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Even when it turns.

308
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Kya!

309
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Kya!

310
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Mori

311
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Kya!

312
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Kya!

313
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Wait.

314
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
There's a little color.

315
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Are you serious?

316
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
You're like this in the back.

317
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
It's true.

318
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
That's why you're a fool.

319
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
The main point is.

320
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
It's true.

321
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
It's true?

322
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Yes.

323
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
It's like this.

324
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I thought, wow, this old man is strong.

325
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
And I was riding with a friend.

326
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
And when I got there.

327
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I said, please take a break.

328
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Yes.

329
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Yes.

330
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
And when I handed over the money.

331
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I took a lot of money.

332
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
No.

333
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
It's more than 1,000 yen.

334
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I gave you a little money.

335
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
That's right.

336
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I took a lot of money.

337
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
The little money fell.

338
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
The little money fell.

339
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I thought I had to do something about it.

340
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
It's true.

341
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I gave you a little money.

342
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
And you said, you gave me a little money.

343
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
He was angry.

344
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Yes.

345
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
He was angry.

346
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
It's like this.

347
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
It's true.

348
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
It's true.

349
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
It's true.

350
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
It's true.

351
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I wanted to get off there.

352
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
He got off.

353
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
You.

354
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Apologize.

355
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Apologize.

356
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Apologize.

357
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
It's true.

358
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
It's true.

359
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
The window is only open from the back.

360
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
The driver's seat.

361
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
What are you complaining about?

362
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Don't come from Kansai and complain.

363
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
You.

364
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Well, it's okay.

365
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
You are number one.

366
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,000
It's already over there.

367
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
You are the first.

368
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
First.

369
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I'm the first.

370
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Kiku-chan.

371
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Hana-chan.

372
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
It was a big storm.

373
00:14:53,000 --> 00:15:00,000
For example, if you go to a restaurant and they say there's something in there...

374
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, like, let's just get it for free or something.

375
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Or like, buy it for us or something.

376
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I don't ever say that.

377
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
It's bad, you know. You're not doing it knowingly.

378
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I know that, but if there's a small cockroach in there, it won't be a plate, right?

379
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I think I'll probably take it out and eat it and go home.

380
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Oh, really?

381
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,000
There was a time when there was a shell in my ramen.

382
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
It was a shell.

383
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
You know what a shell is, right?

384
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

385
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
It's a shell, right?

386
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
There's another way to say a shell.

387
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
What?

388
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
A shell?

389
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
You're so mean!

390
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
It's hard for us to say that.

391
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
A, a, a shell!

392
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
You say a shell.

393
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
You say a shell, so I don't know.

394
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I'll say it again.

395
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
It's a shell.

396
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
In your ramen.

397
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
There was a shell in it.

398
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
A, a, a shell.

399
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
It's hard to say.

400
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
There was a shell in it.

401
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,000
But I took it out and ate it.

402
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
It's a shell.

403
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
If it was a shell, it wouldn't be a problem.

404
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
It's a shell!

405
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
No, it's not.

406
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
If you keep saying things like that, the people at the store will feel bad.

407
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
It's okay if I don't do it.

408
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
You're a student wrestler.

409
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I'm not a wrestler.

410
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I didn't do it because I knew it.

411
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
When you make ramen, there's a container that says, ka.

412
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000
If you put it in, it's okay.

413
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
If it was a shell, it would be okay.

414
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
If it was a shell, it would be okay.

415
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
If it was a shell, it would be okay.

416
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
If you put it in, it would be okay.

417
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
If it was a shell, it would be okay.

418
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
That's right.

419
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
That's right.

420
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,000
If you put it in, it's okay.

421
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
What's a shell?

422
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I'm sorry.

423
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
If you put it in, it's okay.

424
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
If it was a shell, it would be okay.

425
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
If you put it in, it's okay.

426
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
You're still a student wrestler.

427
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I'm not a wrestler.

428
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
There was a streetcar in Osaka.

429
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,000
We were two people, and we were going to work.

430
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:18,000
We were stepped on, so I came to you, and I stepped on you.

431
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
You came to me, and you stepped on me.

432
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
We were standing like this.

433
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
It hurts, doesn't it?

434
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
We were checking each other.

435
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
It hurt.

436
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I don't know if he noticed, but we were trying to go to the other car.

437
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
We were walking, and we were walking together.

438
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
We were walking together.

439
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
We were walking together.

440
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
We were walking together.

441
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I don't know anything about that.

442
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:48,000
We were two people, and we were walking together.

443
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
It hurts.

444
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I don't know anything about that.

445
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I clearly remember this.

446
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Let's go to the post office.

447
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Post office.

448
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Yes.

449
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
The costume has changed from today.

450
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
It's the same as when we met in the opening.

451
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Yes.

452
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Please go home.

453
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
We don't have much time, so let's move on.

454
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:17,000
The author is Tomoko Kayano from Yokohama City.

455
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
He's a 19-year-old student.

456
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Good evening.

457
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I have a question for you.

458
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,000
When you were in middle school, you ran down Rokkou Farm and almost died.

459
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Why did you run down? Tell us.

460
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
We were walking, and we were walking.

461
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
We made it ourselves.

462
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
We were wearing jerseys.

463
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
We were wearing jerseys.

464
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
We were in middle school.

465
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
We were walking up Rokkou Mountain.

466
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
We were crossing the road.

467
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
It's all farmland.

468
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
It's a beautiful place.

469
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
The slope is really steep.

470
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
There are sheep below us.

471
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
The herd of sheep passes through.

472
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
It's a fun place to bring children.

473
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
We were playing on the slope.

474
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Why did you run?

475
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
To catch the monster.

476
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
To catch the monster?

477
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Yes.

478
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
We were chased.

479
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
We ran into the slope.

480
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
It was a steep slope.

481
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:10,000
I was screaming, but he couldn't stop.

482
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I was the boss.

483
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I was the boss.

484
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:20,000
He ran away, and I thought, wow, this guy is fast.

485
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
He made me run.

486
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I thought, what is this guy?

487
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
From behind, it was really funny.

488
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
He was like this.

489
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
My legs couldn't reach him because of the speed.

490
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
And you hit the tree.

491
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
I didn't hit the tree.

492
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
You hit the tree.

493
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I was screaming.

494
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
I was about to run into the sheep.

495
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
It was after the rain, so my legs slipped.

496
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
The sheep was right in front of me.

497
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,000
At that time, I really thought I was going to die.

498
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
That's right.

499
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
You had to be careful.

500
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
You were saved.

501
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Thank you very much.

502
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
17 prefectures, Saitama prefecture.

503
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
17 prefectures, Saitama prefecture.

504
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
What? 17 prefectures, Saitama prefecture?

505
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
No, no, no.

506
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
17 prefectures, Saitama prefecture.

507
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
17 prefectures?

508
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
I've never heard of it.

509
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Good evening, Mr. Matsumoto. How are you?

510
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
What prefecture are you from?

511
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
17 prefectures.

512
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Mr. Matsumoto has a wife, so it doesn't matter.

513
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Please tell me the type of woman you like.

514
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Who do you like?

515
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
I don't like her.

516
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Who do you like?

517
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Who do you like as a celebrity?

518
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
I don't like her now.

519
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:44,000
I like Misako Konno.

520
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
That's a little...

521
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
What?

522
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
What?

523
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Why?

524
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:58,000
She has a bad temper.

525
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
I like her.

526
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
I also like Maako Hido.

527
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
What?

528
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Why are you so obsessed with the puberty type?

529
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
I don't like it.

530
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:15,000
I like the puberty type.

531
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
I like her.

532
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
I remember.

533
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
What?

534
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Chisato Muritaka.

535
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
What?

536
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:28,000
When I went to work the other day, I had time.

537
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
I took out my wallet and said,

538
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Hey, what?

539
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
I took out 10,000 yen from my wallet.

540
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Hey, what?

541
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
What?

542
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
A young girl came and said,

543
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
I went to the record store and said,

544
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Muritaka Land.

545
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Muritaka Land.

546
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
That CD or something.

547
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I don't like it.

548
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Yes, that's why.

549
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Thank you very much for today.

550
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Is it over?

551
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
What?

552
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
What?

553
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
You should have left it here at first.

554
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
That's why.

555
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Is it time?

556
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Yes, it's time.

557
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
I see.

558
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Thank you very much.

559
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
I'm sweating.

560
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Why?

561
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
I'm sorry.

562
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
That's all.

563
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Yes.

564
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Have a good time.

565
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Thank you very much.

566
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Today, we finished the first episode of Muritaka Land.

567
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Is it over?

568
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Yes.

569
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
That's right.

570
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
If it's over, it's over all the time.

571
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
I wonder.

572
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
It's okay.

573
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
One more thing.

574
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Even though it was released today,

575
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
I don't think there's anything good about the audience's reaction.

576
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
I wonder if it's okay.

577
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Is there anything else?

578
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
What?

579
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Oh, the assistant.

580
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I have to put in an assistant.

581
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
From now on.

582
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Is it a woman?

583
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Of course.

584
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
I'll ask for a good one.

585
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
That's right.

586
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,000
It's not like the companion of Atami.

587
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
I wonder what happened.

588
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
No, it's okay because it's not on the screen.

589
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
That fat guy.

590
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Yes.

591
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
So what?

592
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Such a fat guy.

593
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Two people came to the party.

594
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
I wonder if it's okay.

595
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,000
No, it's not like the companion of Atami.

596
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Wait a minute.

597
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
I'll ask for a good one.

598
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I'll ask for a good one.

599
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
I'll ask for a good one.

600
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
I'll ask for a good one.

601
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
I'll ask for a good one.

602
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Is that all right?

603
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Yes.

604
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Let it flow.

605
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
That's it for this week.

606
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Until next week.

607
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Goodbye.

608
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:48,000
