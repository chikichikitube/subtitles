1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
First, we have the young entertainer, Rikujin!

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:15,000
What I'm going to say is that the young people these days are getting more and more new and it's a very good thing.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
But it's a bit of a happy joke.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
That's right.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,100
Here, there was a stinger from Mr. Yamada,

6
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:26,900
It was so ugly, right?

7
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:31,200
It was a 2006 Vzing- Furthermore, strong, that was right under the глав della azone.

8
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:35,140
...the sound from Het Dad's Scheme Tournament had ا

9
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,860
This Young Patron Array, who are they?

10
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:45,360
It was a secret project where is was collected the members of the Young Patrons of this quantify age.

11
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,360
The young comedians of Yoshimoto Tojo.

12
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,360
All of them are wearing the same clothes as the old ones.

13
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,360
This will be the key to the surprise.

14
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,360
The two teams are fighting with each other.

15
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:08,360
The referee Hamada's butt is being hit by the opponent's knee.

16
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:13,360
Hamada is being hit hard.

17
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:18,360
The gang members treat the young people as criminals.

18
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:21,360
The seniors' words are absolute.

19
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,360
What will the young people do?

20
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,360
The family members will say,

21
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,360
You are the one who said that.

22
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:30,360
They will kick and hit you.

23
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,360
No, no, no.

24
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,360
They will kick and hit you.

25
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,360
They will hit you.

26
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,360
I don't believe it.

27
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,360
They don't like it.

28
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:39,360
If the knife cuts, they will leave.

29
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,360
That's right.

30
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:43,360
But it's not really a cut.

31
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,360
It's just a little bit.

32
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,360
Well, there are some parts that hurt.

33
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,360
You really have to cut it.

34
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,360
This time's prank.

35
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:55,360
The target that will be raised at the end of the day is...

36
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:59,360
13 years of acting experience, barely young, 2-chome-ken-ju.

37
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:04,360
2003 F1 Grand Prix Fashion, Football Hour.

38
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,360
The charismatic Iro Uemura.

39
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,360
And...

40
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:14,360
For some reason, Dave Spector joins the team.

41
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,360
What is the reason?

42
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,360
There are people like this.

43
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,360
They are safe...

44
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,360
They are safe.

45
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,360
It's hard to tell.

46
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,360
I'm the one who's scared.

47
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,360
It's this guy.

48
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,360
It's Kōri.

49
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:33,360
What was Yoshimoto called?

50
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,360
Hugh Grant.

51
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,360
What is this?

52
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,360
It's a British...

53
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,360
What is this?

54
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,360
This is a coin.

55
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,360
What is this?

56
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,360
Is this a coin?

57
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,360
It's a normal coin.

58
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,360
This program is brought to you by the sponsors you see.

59
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,360
I want to go to the toilet

60
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,360
No!

61
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,360
Before the performance, the youngsters didn't know that the scary prank was waiting for them

62
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,360
They were quite relaxed

63
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:18,360
On the other hand, the staff was preparing for the actual performance

64
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,360
And then

65
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,360
Good morning

66
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,360
Please

67
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,360
Please

68
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:30,360
The young men who know nothing, enter the studio without warning.

69
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,360
The first shot.

70
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,360
The first shot is good.

71
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,360
Good morning.

72
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,360
Good morning.

73
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,360
Good morning.

74
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,360
Good morning.

75
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,360
I don't know who is who.

76
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,360
I really don't know.

77
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,360
Please.

78
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,360
What?

79
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,360
What's wrong?

80
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,360
What's wrong?

81
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,360
I will explain the scene of the appearance.

82
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:00,360
A little late, the main character Hamada appears.

83
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:03,360
Now all the stages are ready.

84
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,360
Hamada-san, please.

85
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,360
Good morning.

86
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,360
Finally, the curtain of a horror prank is raised.

87
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:30,360
We will now begin the 2005 G1 Special Tag Match.

88
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:36,360
First, we have the child's voice actor, Nao Generations.

89
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,360
Oh!

90
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,360
Ah!

91
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,360
Ah!

92
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,360
Are you okay?

93
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,360
Hey!

94
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,360
Hey!

95
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,360
Are you okay?

96
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,360
What the hell is this?

97
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,360
What the hell is this?

98
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:12,360
Why are you all on the comedy team?

99
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,360
It's natural for the main character to be on the comedy team.

100
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,360
Oh, is that so?

101
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,360
It's natural.

102
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,360
Rehearsal?

103
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,360
Isn't this a rehearsal?

104
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,360
Oh, really?

105
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,360
I'm sorry to make you feel like it's real.

106
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,360
Really?

107
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,360
You said you didn't like it.

108
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,360
I'm sorry.

109
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,360
Do it again!

110
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:42,360
With this unexpected happening, the truth of the prank will be even more obvious.

111
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:48,580
A vitilstein of Bifically Fantastic Little both now and many generations shove in the hole!

112
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,320
Viva!!

113
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,320
Young Generation Zero

114
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,320
You're too much!

115
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,320
You're too much!

116
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,320
Yes!

117
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,320
Okay!

118
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:24,320
And now, like Aoko, the Young Generation Zero is entering!

119
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,320
Yeah!

120
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,320
Yeah!

121
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,320
Yeah!

122
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,320
Yeah!

123
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,320
Yeah!

124
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,320
What the hell is this?

125
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,320
What the hell is this?

126
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,320
What the hell is this?

127
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,320
Himai-san!

128
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:54,320
Your body is like a long shaku.

129
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,320
Stop it!

130
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,320
Stop it!

131
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:02,320
After this, Hamada is finally defeated.

132
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:05,320
At this moment, the young people's reaction is...

133
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,320
Now, we will start the match.

134
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,320
Both teams will receive a bouquet of flowers.

135
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,320
The beautiful part of the body is...

136
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,320
Oh, my!

137
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,320
Hey, you!

138
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,320
Stop it! Stop it!

139
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,320
Hey, you!

140
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:43,320
ejaba, tougher than a soft movies.

141
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:48,720
If you give up the waterproof suspended film,

142
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:57,320
you should be able to enter international ¿ultimate ¿见 with important ¿people spheres ¿and with the Whipping power.

143
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:03,320
Moreover, it'll be a rest software.

144
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:06,320
Don't get cocky.

145
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:14,320
Stop what you are doing.

146
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,320
Do it properly.

147
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:20,320
From the beginning.

148
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:23,320
You are a fool.

149
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,320
A fool?

150
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,320
Stop it.

151
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:46,320
Who is the boss?

152
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,320
Excuse me.

153
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,320
Who is the boss?

154
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,320
I'm sorry.

155
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,320
I'm sorry.

156
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,320
I'm sorry.

157
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,320
I'm sorry.

158
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,320
The young men are in the room.

159
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,320
They are the first to see Hamada's fear.

160
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:10,320
They are all white.

161
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,320
What is their fate?

162
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,320
It feels good.

163
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,320
It feels really good.

164
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,320
It's okay.

165
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,320
I'm angry that I'm doing this in front of you.

166
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,320
I'm scared.

167
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,320
Not at all.

168
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,320
The staff is not here.

169
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,320
I'm scared.

170
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,320
Do you want to resume?

171
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,320
Yes.

172
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,320
The staff is here.

173
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,320
I'm scared.

174
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,320
I'm scared.

175
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:39,320
I can't do it.

176
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:44,320
I've been waiting for a long time.

177
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,320
But Dave is good.

178
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:50,320
Excuse me, we are...

179
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,320
Well, we are bad people.

180
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,320
But if it goes on like this, it's not good.

181
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,320
Oh, you're here.

182
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,320
It's like you can change it after you wear it.

183
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,320
You can change it after you wear it?

184
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,320
This is amazing.

185
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,320
It's finally the worst.

186
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,320
I don't know what to do with this.

187
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,320
I don't know either.

188
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,320
I'm sorry to say that you've worked hard.

189
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,320
I don't know.

190
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,320
I don't know.

191
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,320
You're wearing a mask.

192
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,320
I don't know.

193
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,320
I don't know.

194
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,320
I don't know.

195
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,320
I don't know.

196
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,320
I don't know who did it.

197
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,320
Everyone was kicking.

198
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:35,320
I was trying to crouch.

199
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:39,320
I was holding the tape.

200
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:44,320
And while I was doing that, I saw Mr. Omaeda.

201
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,320
You missed the rock.

202
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,320
I missed the rock.

203
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,320
You missed the rock.

204
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,320
I said, this is not it.

205
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,320
I was kicking it.

206
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,320
You were kicking it, right?

207
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,320
What?

208
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,320
Goto was there.

209
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,320
I was kicking it.

210
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,320
I don't think I hit it.

211
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,320
Really?

212
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,320
Yeah.

213
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,320
This is good.

214
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,320
Eh?

215
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:15,320
It's not like he's really nervous.

216
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:18,320
To relax the nervous young people here,

217
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,320
Yamasaki and Kokoriko head to the dressing room.

218
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:24,320
I want to do it again.

219
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,320
No, you can't.

220
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,320
It's impossible.

221
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,320
I tried to do it, but it's the same.

222
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,320
He hasn't taken off his mask yet.

223
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:38,320
He says he can't, but he's wearing one.

224
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:43,320
Hello.

225
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:48,320
They keep saying sorry.

226
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,320
I don't hear them.

227
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,320
Why do you think they're angry?

228
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,320
Who kicked him?

229
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,320
I think they're angry.

230
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,960
To be honest, I think they're all mad.

231
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:03,960
They're thinking, why are you getting angry at that?

232
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,960
But, after the shampoo...

233
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,960
The shampoo...

234
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,960
It's been a while.

235
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,960
Yes.

236
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,960
Oh, sorry.

237
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,960
I'll do it.

238
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,960
I'll do it.

239
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,960
I'll do it.

240
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,960
I'll do it.

241
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,960
I was behind Eno-san.

242
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:29,960
I think he's kicking because he's only stretched his legs.

243
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,960
Everyone's kicking when they kick.

244
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:38,960
He's saying this because he doesn't remember.

245
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,960
Everyone's kicking when they kick.

246
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,960
He's saying it from the heart.

247
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,960
I'll teach you.

248
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,960
That's not it.

249
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:55,960
I think Yandou-san said it a lot.

250
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:56,960
No, no, no.

251
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,960
I honestly said it a lot.

252
00:12:58,960 --> 00:12:59,960
Really?

253
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:00,960
Yandou-san.

254
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:01,960
You did?

255
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,960
You guys said it.

256
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,960
Yandou-san said it a lot.

257
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:14,960
He said it.

258
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,960
Ah, Yandou-san said it.

259
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:24,960
For now, everyone is going to be in a good mood, like they're going to get rid of their relationship with Daichi.

260
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:28,960
Wow, Korori is like a liquid.

261
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:29,960
Isn't it amazing?

262
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:32,960
It's going to disappear.

263
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:35,960
It's like candy.

264
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:38,960
We're going to change the room.

265
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:41,960
We're going to change the room.

266
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:45,960
It's like a change of mood.

267
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:46,960
What?

268
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,960
What Dave wrote was,

269
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,960
There's a cultural difference.

270
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:53,960
You're a fool.

271
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:54,960
You're a fool.

272
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:55,960
You're a fool.

273
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:59,960
To ease the tension of the young people,

274
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,960
They're going to take the next step.

275
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,960
Hamada is also ready to take action.

276
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:08,960
The surprise is finally coming.

277
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:10,960
I think everyone's awake now.

278
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,960
Who said, Knee?

279
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:13,960
Knee?

280
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:17,040
Uwa, it's a guitar cymbal!

281
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:20,960
As expected, I missed completely

282
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:26,680
If I had had a guitar, I would definitely Move.

283
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:31,960
She is, at that time, have been asked with no excuse.

284
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:36,960
So, I told her in the beginning to have all software go.

285
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,960
What she said was going to fail if all of the software is Mickey Mouse,

286
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:42,540
So, you mean she say I我們, Dave?

287
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:46,240
Since M maravil is standing so...

288
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:48,900
Captain baby please!

289
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,760
You motherboard don't have knowledge of the A.B.

290
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,560
No we didn't

291
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:02,840
Um probably......

292
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,180
I'll leave it like this

293
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,900
I would say....

294
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:14,900
I think there is a point where I think it is.

295
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:16,900
Among you.

296
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:19,900
You came, Hyogurand.

297
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:25,900
Please.

298
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:28,900
Wow, this is...

299
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:29,900
Dave and Harada.

300
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:31,900
Wow, that's...

301
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:37,900
It's the most helpful that Dave's hit was the most effective.

302
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:38,900
That's true.

303
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:42,900
By the way, the people who are here now are saying that Dave kicked them.

304
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:46,900
That's why they're saying that they went home.

305
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:50,900
Endo-san was saying that Dave-san is...

306
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:53,900
Dave-san is a pain in the ass.

307
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:58,900
The young people who are desperate to escape responsibility are being punished for their sin.

308
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:05,900
After this, the members of the group will give out the final information.

309
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:12,900
Yes?

310
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:14,900
Hello.

311
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:15,900
Hello.

312
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:16,900
Hello.

313
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:17,900
Hello.

314
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:19,900
I don't know what to say.

315
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:26,900
The tiger guy said it was definitely him.

316
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:32,900
I'm not sure if I should say this, but I've been told that it's a tiger's face snack.

317
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,900
Everyone's looking at me.

318
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:38,900
I've been told that I've licked it.

319
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:42,900
It's like licking a lager.

320
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:48,900
I don't know why it's like licking a lager.

321
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:52,900
Anyway, someone...

322
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:55,900
Everyone's licking it.

323
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,900
All of them are tigers.

324
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,900
That's not good.

325
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:01,900
That's not good.

326
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:03,900
So it's not a team of tigers.

327
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:06,900
Yes.

328
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:09,900
That's all.

329
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:12,900
I'm sorry.

330
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,900
I can't do this.

331
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:16,900
I'll go.

332
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:17,900
It's okay.

333
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:20,900
I think he thinks it's me.

334
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:21,900
Why?

335
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:22,900
Why?

336
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:24,900
He's very sensitive.

337
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:27,900
You're not a victim?

338
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:29,900
Yes, I am.

339
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:32,900
It's like I'm the victim.

340
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,900
It's here.

341
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:40,900
Who is it?

342
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:41,900
Is it the police?

343
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,900
For some reason he confesses that he is the culprit.

344
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:52,900
He walks along the hallway leading to Hamada's dressing room.

345
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:57,900
What will Hamada show us in the climax of the prank?

346
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,900
I'm sorry.

347
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,900
No, it's okay.

348
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:09,900
Excuse me.

349
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,900
Excuse me.

350
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:34,900
Sorry.

351
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:35,900
Sorry.

352
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:36,900
Sorry.

353
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,900
I'll give you a kiss.

354
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,900
Kohori, do this.

355
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,900
Do this. It's a prank.

356
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:47,900
Who is it?

357
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:48,900
Kohori.

358
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:53,900
You've been saying that you'll do it.

359
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,900
It was a bit close.

360
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,900
But it wasn't me.

361
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:00,900
I thought it was definitely Eno.

362
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:02,900
I did it.

363
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:03,900
Oh, no.

364
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:05,900
That's why he was so depressed.

365
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,900
He was so angry, but he still hit me.

366
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,900
That's Hamada-san.

367
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,900
Yo! Remember that!

368
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:16,900
That's Hamada-san.

369
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:18,900
Who is it?

370
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:20,900
It's you!

371
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:22,900
You're the one who brought the gachos.

372
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:26,900
I'm going to do this with you two.

373
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:28,900
I don't know yet.

374
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:30,900
I can do it again.

375
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:32,900
I really can't do it. I was thinking which one is better.

376
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:33,900
I think rock is better.

377
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,900
But I think rock is better.

378
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:39,900
Then, can someone bring the rock?

379
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:46,900
What kind of reaction will he show to call the sudden football rock to the dressing room?

380
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:56,400
The hair are controlled by a chain.

381
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,240
arts and Definitely,

382
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:57,780
I think,

383
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:16,220
Ja'

384
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:16,760
deshi

385
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:18,960
Mr.

386
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,960
What's wrong?

387
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,960
Are you okay?

388
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,960
What's wrong?

389
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,960
What's wrong?

390
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,960
What's wrong?

391
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,960
That was scary.

392
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:46,960
That was scary, but you were scary enough.

393
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,960
When Hamada-san got angry?

394
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:52,960
I was really scared. I almost cried.

395
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,960
Because I was really scared.

396
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,960
I didn't mean to be a prank. I was really scared.

397
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:00,960
That was true.

398
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:05,960
In the end, Hamada himself beat up the three students.

399
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:08,960
What will happen to them?

400
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,960
The atmosphere is heavy.

401
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,960
The three of them can't talk at all.

402
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,960
You guys are different!

403
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,960
You're all the same!

404
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,960
If you lick it...

405
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,960
I licked it.

406
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:49,960
You had a great face.

407
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,960
What's wrong?

408
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,960
Goto, what's wrong?

409
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:58,960
Goto is crying.

410
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,960
Almost everyone is crying.

411
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,960
It's close to the end.

412
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:04,960
It's not bad.

413
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,960
It's quite different.

414
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:07,960
Is it okay?

415
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:08,960
It's okay.

416
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:09,960
I wonder if he'll get angry.

417
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,960
I don't want to take it off.

418
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:12,960
I don't want to take it off.

419
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,960
Hey, come on!

420
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,960
I'm climbing up!

421
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,960
Hey, come on!

422
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:19,960
It's dangerous.

423
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,960
You guys are really bad.

424
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:25,960
I'll admit that it's Dave's fault.

425
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:26,960
That's right.

426
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,960
I'm scared!

427
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:29,960
That's right.

428
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:32,960
We were watching the monitor and Goto was playing the game.

429
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,960
He was probably trying to take the responsibility of the team.

430
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:39,960
But that scene was so bad!

431
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:41,960
I remember!

432
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:42,960
I remember!

433
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:43,960
I remember!

434
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:44,960
I was reading the rules.

435
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:46,960
I got it!

436
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,960
Everyone, we've finished the first part.

437
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:54,960
Now, everyone will be the initiator.

438
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,960
From now on, the two karate masters will come.

439
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:01,420
I already wrote thank you I'll record more next time

440
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:03,240
Everyone is acting properly

441
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,260

443
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:10,040
I'm still feeling nervous

444
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:11,380
So what is the nextament?

445
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:14,540
Their member will be acting with sheet intervention

446
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:16,500
I didn't do that either

447
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:20,060
Their target is Karate

448
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:26,040
They are going to

449
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:28,040
This is how you expect it!

450
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,040
You're the one who's going to die!

451
