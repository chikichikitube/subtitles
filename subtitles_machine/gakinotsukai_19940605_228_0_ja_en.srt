1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,240
After the Tokyo Olympics, Paralympic TV has started to gain more viewers, with a 60% success rate.

2
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:09,840
The number of viewers has increased to 48 million.

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,840
Many ghost shows have been created.

4
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:19,140
However, since the era of multi-channel, the number of viewers has increased to a large extent.

5
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:26,640
The fact that the number of viewers has decreased has become a problem for the Japanese government.

6
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,440
In 1994, we, Gaki no Tsukai, were not an exception.

7
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:38,640
We thoroughly researched high-viewing programs, and tonight, the opening of Gaki no Tsukai aims for the highest viewing rate in the TV market.

8
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,640
Good evening, everyone.

9
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,640
I'm Masatoshi Hamada of Dandan.

10
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:51,640
Today's opening of Dandan's Gaki no Tsukai is...

11
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:56,640
Let's seriously think about the viewing rate.

12
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:06,640
Our Gaki no Tsukai producer, Mr. Kenji Suga, is here to talk to us.

13
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,640
Let's hear what he has to say.

14
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,640
Mr. Suga.

15
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:16,640
What kind of program has gained the highest viewing rate?

16
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:22,640
I think everyone is underestimating me.

17
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,640
Right now, I'm not a man who can't get a high viewing rate.

18
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,640
I'm a man who can't get a high viewing rate.

19
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,640
You can't get a high viewing rate? I see.

20
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:36,640
There are three factors that I can get a high viewing rate.

21
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:41,640
People in the industry will be surprised.

22
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,640
First of all, ramen.

23
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:46,640
That's right.

24
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,640
Second, hot springs.

25
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,640
And finally, the animal that Mr. Mutsugoro represents.

26
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,640
If you have these three factors, you can get a high viewing rate.

27
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,640
I see.

28
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:04,640
Now, let's hear how the opening of Gaki no Tsukai will develop.

29
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,640
We have Mr. Hitoshi Matsumoto here with us.

30
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:13,640
Let's hear what he has to say, Mr. Matsumoto.

31
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:18,640
As I was saying, there are three factors.

32
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,640
There are also other factors.

33
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,640
I'll tell the viewers.

34
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:28,640
Today's opening is a choice of those factors.

35
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:34,640
Even if it's a big deal, let's say 60%.

36
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,640
We have baseball today.

37
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:41,640
Even if it's a big deal, let's say 15%.

38
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,640
I see.

39
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:46,640
I'll aim for 60%.

40
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,640
Please watch.

41
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,640
The ultimate ramen.

42
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:06,640
It's delicious.

43
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,640
It's delicious.

44
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,640
Do you want some?

45
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,640
Why not?

46
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:16,640
Hot springs are the best.

47
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,640
Yukemuri Hot Spring.

48
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,640
It's getting a little hot.

49
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:29,640
Hot spring.

50
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:36,640
Is it good?

51
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,640
Yes.

52
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,640
It's delicious.

53
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,640
Animal food.

54
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,640
Yamasaki, give me some tissue.

55
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,640
Yes.

56
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,640
Dominos are delicious.

57
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,640
What are you doing?

58
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,640
Don't do that.

59
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:07,640
It's my first time going to a hot spring.

60
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,640
It's his first time going to a hot spring.

61
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,640
How is it?

62
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,640
Can I eat this?

63
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,640
It's delicious.

64
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,640
How is it?

65
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,640
It's delicious.

66
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,640
Marathon Chinese food.

67
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,640
How is it?

68
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,640
I ate it.

69
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,640
Please throw away the cigarette.

70
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,640
What?

71
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,640
Please throw away the cigarette.

72
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,640
This?

73
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,640
Yes.

74
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,640
Can I throw it away?

75
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,640
No, it's still on fire.

76
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:46,640
It's still on fire?

77
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:47,640
Yes.

78
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,640
Why?

79
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,640
Please throw it away.

80
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,640
No, it's still on fire.

81
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,640
Surprised human.

82
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,640
It's big.

83
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,640
It's big.

84
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,640
Let's show them.

85
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:33,640
Mr. Maric's super magic.

86
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:41,640
It's a camera.

87
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,640
I love you.

88
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,640
Today is my first time.

89
00:05:43,640 --> 00:06:05,640
I'm going to a hot spring.

90
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:13,640
I'm going to a hot spring.

91
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,640
It's small.

92
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,640
It's small.

93
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,640
It's small.

94
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:22,640
It's not nutritious at all.

95
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,640
Look at the back.

96
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:30,640
It's amazing.

97
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:55,640
This program is brought to you by these sponsors.

98
00:06:55,640 --> 00:07:00,640
There are two stuffed animals over there.

99
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:03,640
It's a big stuffed animal.

100
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:08,640
I didn't know it was in the way.

101
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,640
When I came to see you before, it was like this.

102
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:14,640
You're lying.

103
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:17,640
I've known you since you were a kid.

104
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,640
I used to say, brother, brother.

105
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,640
I used to say, brother, please drop it.

106
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:24,640
I've seen it for a while.

107
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,640
It's a big thing.

108
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,640
I thought you'd get angry if I made a mistake.

109
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,640
I won't get angry.

110
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,640
How was it today?

111
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,640
I'm glad it was a little cool today.

112
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,640
I'm glad it was a little cool today.

113
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,640
It was hot in the spring.

114
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,640
It was hot.

115
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,640
It's hot.

116
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,640
My head is going to explode.

117
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,640
That's right.

118
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:48,640
They're just watching.

119
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:51,640
You often say bad things about people on the show.

120
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,640
I can't say that.

121
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,640
You can't say that.

122
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,640
You can't say that without a doubt.

123
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,640
That's probably a crime.

124
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,640
To some extent.

125
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,640
Who are you talking about?

126
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:05,640
When I went to the other world, it was a crime.

127
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,640
It's definitely going to happen.

128
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,640
Why?

129
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:11,640
Even if you throw something out of the window in a car, it's a crime.

130
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,640
I don't get caught doing that.

131
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,640
I don't.

132
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:17,640
But someone's watching from above.

133
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:22,640
It's as bad as killing someone.

134
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,640
Like firecrackers.

135
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:28,640
What?

136
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:32,640
Other than killing people or firecrackers, you're all okay.

137
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,640
I'm okay.

138
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:38,640
What a big guy you are.

139
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:43,640
But I think it's a little bit of a crime to throw something out of the window.

140
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:46,640
If it's piled up, if you go over there, it's definitely...

141
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,640
What are you talking about?

142
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,640
You'll be shown.

143
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,640
What are you talking about?

144
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,640
Like this.

145
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,640
What is this?

146
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,640
What is this?

147
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:01,640
When you're born, you're born with about a thousand points.

148
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:04,640
If you say bad things about people, one point will decrease.

149
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,640
You have about five more points.

150
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,640
It's a dangerous situation.

151
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:12,640
If you go to the other world, there are about five scary old men.

152
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,640
Five?

153
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,640
It's really scary.

154
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,640
But you have five, right?

155
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,640
I don't know if it's scary or not.

156
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,640
It's a dead end.

157
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:26,640
It doesn't matter if it's a punch or a dead end.

158
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,640
So it's okay.

159
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,640
You're going to lose points, right?

160
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:32,640
But you have to earn points somewhere.

161
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:39,640
I want to ask you if you're doing something good.

162
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,640
You don't have to do something big like me.

163
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:44,640
What do you want to do?

164
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,640
I'd like to donate.

165
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,640
Wait a minute.

166
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,640
What about the money?

167
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,640
Money...

168
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,640
Something like that.

169
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,640
I don't know if it's something like that.

170
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,640
I do it once a year.

171
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,640
Money?

172
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:03,640
And something sweet.

173
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,640
It's a different era.

174
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:08,640
Donating something sweet.

175
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,640
I'm tired, so I'm going to eat.

176
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,640
Where are you going?

177
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,640
I don't know the whole story.

178
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,640
What are you talking about?

179
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,640
I think you should do something like that.

180
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,640
I don't have a machine like that.

181
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:27,640
I'm going to help my grandmother a little bit.

182
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,640
You're going to help your grandmother a little bit?

183
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,640
Just a little bit?

184
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,640
It's a matter of words.

185
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:37,640
I'm going to support my grandmother a little bit.

186
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:42,640
I think I should do something good at least once a day.

187
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:47,640
The other day, I was waiting for someone in a car in Shinjuku.

188
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:50,640
Why is it 2?

189
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,640
Is it not good?

190
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,640
I'm not saying it's not good.

191
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,640
I'm waiting.

192
00:10:55,640 --> 00:11:00,640
That's right.

193
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,640
An Irish man came to me.

194
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,640
And he hit me.

195
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:08,640
I told him to give it to me.

196
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:15,640
I don't speak Japanese at all.

197
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,640
I have a heart.

198
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:21,640
What are you talking about?

199
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,640
You really don't know the words.

200
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,640
I have a heart.

201
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,640
What kind of heart do you have?

202
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,640
I have a memory in my arm.

203
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,640
What?

204
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,640
I don't have a memory in my arm.

205
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,640
What are you talking about?

206
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:36,640
I don't speak English at all.

207
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:40,640
I don't speak English at all.

208
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,640
It's a lie, but it's okay.

209
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,640
I don't know what you're talking about.

210
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,640
I'll translate everything.

211
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,640
I don't know what you're talking about.

212
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,640
I'm in that car.

213
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:54,640
You don't need this, do you?

214
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:55,640
Do you understand?

215
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:58,640
I stopped the car at the front.

216
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:01,640
Suddenly, I couldn't move.

217
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:05,640
The battery seems to have run out.

218
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:08,640
Can't you do something about it?

219
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:11,640
OK.

220
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:16,640
It's good.

221
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:20,640
Why are you saying it's good when the other person is in trouble?

222
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,640
No, no, no.

223
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:25,640
If the other person is not good, my feelings are good.

224
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,640
You don't understand the other person.

225
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:30,640
Even if you say it's good.

226
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,640
Why are you nodding?

227
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:35,640
Say it's good.

228
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,640
It's good.

229
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,640
What are you talking about?

230
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:42,640
You don't have to do it the other way around.

231
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:49,640
Look at each other's battery.

232
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,640
Do you understand?

233
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,640
I understand.

234
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,640
Feelings?

235
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,640
I understand.

236
00:12:53,640 --> 00:13:01,640
Power, power, power.

237
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:05,640
I'm really grateful to the people of Iran for helping me.

238
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:08,640
Samurai.

239
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:11,640
I'll never say it.

240
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:12,640
I'll never say it.

241
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:13,640
You are a samurai.

242
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:16,640
I can't say it.

243
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,640
Don't do that.

244
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,640
Hey.

245
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:28,640
I'm really grateful to the people of Iran for helping me.

246
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:33,640
If you do something about it, I'll be grateful.

247
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:36,640
When I'm sleeping, there are people who hit me.

248
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,640
What?

249
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:41,640
When I wake up, there are beautiful women.

250
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:44,640
Please wake me up.

251
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,640
Beautiful wife.

252
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:49,640
Wife?

253
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,640
Where is your wife?

254
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,640
I don't know where my wife is.

255
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,640
Why don't you know your wife?

256
00:13:55,640 --> 00:14:00,640
I don't know.

257
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:04,640
I wanted to say that if you do something good, there will be a reward.

258
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,640
I don't know if it's a reward or not.

259
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:07,640
I wanted to say that.

260
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:08,640
I see.

261
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,640
Don't do that.

262
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,640
I'll think about it when I meet her.

263
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:19,640
I'll think about it when I meet her.

264
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,640
What?

265
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:24,640
I was in the pool when I was in junior high school.

266
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,640
That's a good story.

267
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:29,640
I was drowning in the pool and I almost died.

268
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:30,640
It's like a story of white and black.

269
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,640
What?

270
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:32,640
I saved you.

271
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,640
It's a story of color.

272
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,640
That's all I can say about saving people.

273
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,640
What did you save?

274
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,640
A swimming pool.

275
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:42,640
I was swimming in the pool and my pants were pulled.

276
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,640
When I said, what is it?

277
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:50,640
The kid said.

278
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:59,640
What are you looking at?

279
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:04,640
What are you looking at?

280
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,640
Why are you looking at me?

281
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:10,640
I'm looking at you.

282
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:14,640
I saved your life.

283
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,640
I saved your life.

284
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:19,640
I got 30 points for that.

285
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:20,640
30 points?

286
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:21,640
I saved your life.

287
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:22,640
I saved your life.

288
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,640
I saved your life.

289
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,640
I saved you in the pool.

290
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:26,640
That's obvious.

291
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,640
Is there anyone who can't save you in the pool?

292
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:36,640
I was swimming in the pool and my pants were pulled.

293
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,640
Why am I swimming in the pool?

294
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:41,640
You're a beach baller.

295
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:48,640
You've been in a car and you've pulled small animals, haven't you?

296
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:51,640
I don't want to do it if I can, but I'll jump out of the car.

297
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:56,640
You've done it before, haven't you?

298
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,640
What are you doing?

299
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:02,640
It's dangerous to step on the brake.

300
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,640
What's that?

301
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:05,640
What's that?

302
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:09,640
I don't know if it's a dog or a cat.

303
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:12,640
Don't touch it.

304
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:17,640
Let's go down normally.

305
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:20,640
Come closer.

306
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:24,640
If you don't know if it's a dog or a cat, you should be happy.

307
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:27,640
What are you talking about?

308
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:28,640
I can't help it.

309
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,640
Can't you go back?

310
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:35,640
I'm going to stop being your fan.

311
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:38,640
You're my partner, aren't you?

312
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:42,640
Why don't you laugh?

313
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:45,640
I can't laugh.

314
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:47,640
Why?

315
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,640
You're dirty.

316
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:52,640
I'm a good boy now.

317
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,640
I'm definitely going down.

318
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:55,640
You're lying.

319
00:16:55,640 --> 00:17:04,640
I'm really going down.

320
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,640
Are you American?

321
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:12,640
I'm serious.

322
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,640
What are you looking at?

323
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,640
I'm serious.

324
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,640
Don't lie.

325
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,640
I'm sorry.

326
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:23,640
Don't lie.

327
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:26,640
Have you ever slept next to me until the morning?

328
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,640
I'm talking about whether there was or not.

329
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,640
That's hard.

330
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,640
That's not good.

331
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:36,640
That's 250 points.

332
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,640
You're the same.

333
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,640
I can't help it when I can't help it.

334
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:44,640
But if you run to the animal hospital, you'll have to get your energy back.

335
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,640
Have you ever been to the animal hospital?

336
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,640
Yeah.

337
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:50,640
Let me hear about it.

338
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:56,640
That was hard.

339
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,640
That was hard.

340
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,640
What did you do?

341
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,640
I went to St. Barnard's.

342
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,640
What time did you go?

343
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,640
About 2 o'clock in the morning.

344
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:10,640
You went to St. Barnard's alone at 2 o'clock in the morning?

345
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:14,640
No, I went for a walk.

346
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,640
Did you have a owner?

347
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,640
Yes.

348
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,640
I don't want to go to a place like that.

349
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,640
Why?

350
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,640
Don't you have a owner?

351
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,640
Yes.

352
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,640
Why did you jump out of the car?

353
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:31,640
I was running around.

354
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,640
I hit the car.

355
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,640
You hit the car.

356
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,640
Yes.

357
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,640
Why?

358
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,640
Are you okay?

359
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,640
Who are you talking to?

360
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,640
To the owner.

361
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,640
To the owner.

362
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,640
Are you okay?

363
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:46,640
The owner hugged me.

364
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:52,640
The owner hugged you?

365
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,640
Why did you say that?

366
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,640
Because the owner was lying down.

367
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:03,640
Did you hit someone?

368
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:08,640
You're laughing too much.

369
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:16,640
From now on, I will give this to the person who read the letter.

370
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:21,640
Suddenly, why did Devilman say, Devilwing, Devilwing?

371
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,640
He said it before he could do anything.

372
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,640
You should have told me.

373
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:31,640
I'm trying to do my best.

374
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:34,640
Why are you crying?

375
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:42,640
I don't know.

376
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,640
Are you aware of it?

377
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,640
I think it's a disadvantage to the enemy.

378
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,640
I dare to do it.

379
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:50,640
Why?

380
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,640
I'm stronger than you.

381
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:58,640
I don't know what he's going to do next.

382
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,640
I don't know.

383
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:04,640
I told you at first. I'm stronger than you.

384
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:09,640
No matter how many times I get hit by you, I won't lose.

385
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:12,640
I'm telling you from the bottom of my heart.

386
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:16,640
I think it's better not to say it.

387
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,640
I think so, too.

388
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,640
I'm not saying it.

389
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:25,640
You should make him think, what is he doing?

390
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:31,640
I don't know.

391
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,640
I don't know why.

392
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,640
Why?

393
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:38,640
Make him feel like he's watching something.

394
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,640
Like on TV?

395
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,640
Yes, like on TV.

396
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,640
I think it's Devilwing.

397
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:49,640
If you say Devilwing, I'm wondering what he's doing.

398
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:52,640
That's right.

399
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:58,640
I think it's okay to say something I don't understand.

400
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,640
But if you do this, it comes out like this.

401
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,640
Where does it come out from?

402
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,640
It comes out from here.

403
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,640
It comes out like this?

404
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,640
Yes.

405
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,640
What is this?

406
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:16,640
This is not cool.

407
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:20,640
But this is a little different.

408
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,640
What is this?

409
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,640
This is a pose.

410
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:29,640
This is Ultra Seven.

411
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,640
It comes out from here.

412
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:35,640
I don't need it.

413
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:38,640
This is strange.

414
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,640
How long will Ken-chan Ramen be on sale?

415
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:49,640
I don't know.

416
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:54,640
Can it be on sale forever?

417
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,640
No.

418
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,640
I don't know.

419
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:01,640
This is a commercial.

420
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:05,640
Can't you do it with a great budget?

421
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:06,640
Why?

422
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,640
There are a lot.

423
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,640
Lawson?

424
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,640
Lawson.

425
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,640
There are a lot of Lawsons, right?

426
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,640
What else?

427
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,640
Beer?

428
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:14,640
Beer.

429
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,640
This is strange.

430
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,640
I don't know.

431
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:22,640
This is an intellectual problem.

432
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:26,640
I was surprised.

433
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:30,640
I want to go home.

434
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:34,640
This is a commercial.

435
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:49,640
