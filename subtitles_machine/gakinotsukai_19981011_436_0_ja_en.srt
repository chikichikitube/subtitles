1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Next time at Gaki no Skyline

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Viewers' investigation of Dokechiyonuma Salon

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
A tragic water chase

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Today

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
We went shopping together

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Yes

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
We went shopping together

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Yes

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
At Adidas

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
It's rare

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
It's a rare look

12
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I can only say that

13
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I don't know how it will look

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
It doesn't look new

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
You were in the hospital

16
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I was in the hospital

17
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I was in the hospital for 3 days

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I was in the hospital

19
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
There was an interesting story

20
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
There was an interesting story

21
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Let's go

22
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
The other day

23
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm going to ask

24
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Actually

25
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Mr. Onuma

26
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Yes

27
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
There was a trial in Dokechiyonuma

28
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
The punishment was decided

29
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Yes

30
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
It's not good

31
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
The famous director of Gaki no Skyline

32
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Akihiro Onuma

33
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
With his strong character

34
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
He made people say that he didn't know how to slide

35
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The other day

36
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
His true nature was amazing

37
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
He realized that everyone was bothering him

38
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
The program was in a state of emergency

39
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
The trial was held

40
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
It was a hard to believe case

41
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
At first

42
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
He was confused by the sense of money

43
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
The verdict was of course guilty

44
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
He was punished with a severe punishment

45
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
But this time

46
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
The viewers' complaint was accepted

47
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
This is not a fake

48
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
It's not a fake

49
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
He is very angry

50
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
The other day

51
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
He said that the dance was sluggish

52
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
We were happy

53
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
It can't be helped

54
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
It's the viewers

55
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
That's right

56
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
If the viewers say so

57
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I think I have to be punished with a severe punishment

58
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Of course

59
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I'm here today

60
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Let's have the main character appear

61
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Go ahead

62
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
It's dark

63
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
It's very dark

64
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
This program is brought to you by these sponsors

65
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Since then

66
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
The fish material was sold out

67
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I bought 150 ml of cola

68
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I gave it to a few people

69
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I didn't give anything to them

70
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
It's a waste to eat rice when I was a kid

71
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I made rice balls at home and brought them

72
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
It's not completed

73
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
In addition

74
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
The Las Vegas 5000 yen incident

75
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Many other things were discovered in a short period of time

76
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
The punishment this time

77
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Onuma takes good care of this

78
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
It is said to be a one-point luxury

79
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
There is a clock

80
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I want to throw it into the river

81
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I put it in a capsule and throw it into the river

82
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
If I can catch it

83
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
That's OK

84
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
If I can't catch it, I'll chase it forever

85
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
It's a good flow

86
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
It's a good flow

87
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I want to throw it in the rain

88
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Where is your clock?

89
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
This is it

90
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
This is Onuma's treasure

91
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Swiss luxury car

92
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Double name model

93
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
How much is it?

94
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
150,000 yen

95
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
This is the only one in Japan

96
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Two

97
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Two?

98
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Why can you say that?

99
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
This is called a double name

100
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
It's a very valuable clock

101
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I'm sorry

102
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
You made a funny face

103
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
You said it smoothly

104
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
There are only two in Japan

105
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
There are two in Japan

106
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I have to be at your place

107
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
There are two in Japan

108
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
You have it or not

109
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
There are two

110
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
You can't say that

111
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Let's do it

112
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I'll do my best

113
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
It's OK

114
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
If I fall and roll, can you go?

115
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
OK

116
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Let's go

117
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I hope to see you again

118
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Ready

119
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Start

120
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
OK

121
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
The jet is fast

122
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Onuma is fast

123
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
OK

124
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
What is this?

125
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Onuma, do your best

126
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
It came off

127
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
It came off again

128
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
It can't come off

129
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
It can't come off

130
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
It can't come off

131
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
It's coming

132
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Onuma

133
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
The ball is coming

134
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
It came off

135
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Do your best

136
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
It came off

137
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Onuma

138
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Do your best

139
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Good bye

140
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I hope to see you again

141
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Let's go home

142
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Please forgive me

143
00:05:42,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I didn't want to do it

144
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I hope to see you again

145
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
So

146
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
It was good

147
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
It's been a long time

148
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Next week

149
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Are you OK?

150
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
It's a side match

151
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Next week

152
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I'm going to play golf

153
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
A little

154
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I'm going to improve the rules

155
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Are you OK?

156
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
What is that laugh?

157
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Is it a laugh that you can win?

158
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Think about it

159
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:11,000
If 4 people hit, it's 1 hit

160
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Even if you hit a green

161
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Even if you hit a one-pad

162
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
One person hits a one-pad

163
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
One person hits a one-pad

164
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
If you hit a one-pad, it's 1 hit

165
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
That's right

166
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,000
It's a side match

167
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Only green

168
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Even if you hit a green

169
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
If you hit a one-pad

170
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
If you hit a green

171
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
If you hit a four-pad

172
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
If you hit a one-pad

173
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I can't hit a one-pad

174
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
That's right

175
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
It's OK

176
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
If you hit a four-pad, it's 1 hit

177
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
It can't be helped

178
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
But

179
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,000
If you think about it, you can win

180
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
You are

181
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
As you can see from the previous video

182
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
How far does the circle go?

183
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
But we've been improving since then

184
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I'm not doing anything

185
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I'm doing it

186
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I'm doing a lot of muscle training

187
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
What are you talking about?

188
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I don't do muscle training

189
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I finally won

190
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
What?

191
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
This

192
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I'm doing a lot of muscle training

193
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Really

194
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Moreover

195
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
This is the second time

196
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
The first time, I did too much

197
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
The liquid crystal became strange

198
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
It's amazing

199
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
It has nothing to do with golf

200
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
It's amazing

201
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
It's completely different from me before

202
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
That's fine

203
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Do whatever you want

204
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Do whatever I want

205
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I can see that you're going to lose

206
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
You have to think about the punishment again

207
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
What will you do if four of you lose?

208
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
What?

209
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
If you lose

210
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
The punishment game for four people

211
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Four people?

212
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Isn't it three people?

213
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
No, it's four people

214
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
It's four people

215
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Who did you eliminate?

216
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Yamazaki

217
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Four people

218
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
It's four people

219
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I don't know what the punishment game is

220
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
That's why it's a bit difficult

221
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I don't think you'll lose

222
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I'll try it

223
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Next time, I want you to do E.T.

224
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:47,000
My mother's bicycle basket

225
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Put my mother in the bicycle basket

226
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Wait in the sky

227
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
That

228
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Anyone

229
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Darth Vader

230
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
It's similar

231
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Why didn't you imitate Darth Vader?

232
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I learned it from a child

233
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
And it's not similar

234
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
No one imitated

235
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Everyone has a drawback

236
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
What's the drawback?

237
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,000
You have 2,000 to 3,000

238
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
What?

239
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
A drawback maker

240
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
The drawback is 2,000 to 3,000

241
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I have 2,000 to 3,000

242
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I don't know who it is

243
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I think it can't be helped

244
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
The thing I can't forgive is

245
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Cat tongue

246
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I don't have it at all

247
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I can handle it

248
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I went to a ramen shop

249
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
It's a popular place

250
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
It's a ramen shop in a row

251
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:13,000
The person next to me is the same

252
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
It's a line of people

253
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I looked at it for a while

254
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
What are you doing?

255
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I'm exposing it

256
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
It's a foreign object

257
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I can't shake it

258
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I can't shake it

259
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I'm slowly doing it

260
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Imagine drinking ice water

261
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Do it like this

262
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
What are you doing?

263
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I'm exposing it

264
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I knew it

265
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
And then he goes like this again.

266
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
He doesn't go back and forth.

267
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
This is the second time.

268
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
And then he goes like this again.

269
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
And then he goes like this again.

270
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I got it.

271
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Ramen is one of the best when it's hot.

272
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
There are times when we eat a lot and get a little burned.

273
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Yes, there are. But that's a man.

274
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
There are times when we see a man.

275
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
And then he goes like this.

276
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
And then he goes like this again.

277
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I'm not that kind of man.

278
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
You don't have to go that far.

279
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
You don't have to go that far.

280
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
That's enough.

281
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
What were you doing at first?

282
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
That's enough.

283
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
What was it?

284
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Gasoline.

285
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I'm telling you to fill it up.

286
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
It's like you're wearing it.

287
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I don't understand.

288
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
What about that example?

289
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
What is it? Gasoline.

290
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I'm telling you to fill it up.

291
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
What is it?

292
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
It's not me.

293
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
It's really like that.

294
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
You can't spend too much time on it.

295
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I want to eat as soon as possible.

296
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I want to see the first page of the dictionary.

297
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I want to put in a lot of bean knowledge.

298
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I want to put in a lot of bean knowledge.

299
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
In your mind.

300
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I'm a math king.

301
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I'm a great math king.

302
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Do you know Mangrove?

303
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
What?

304
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
The tree of Mangrove.

305
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I don't know that.

306
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
You just happened to see it.

307
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I don't know that.

308
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I'm very impressed with this story.

309
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
What story?

310
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I'm not trying to be impressed.

311
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

312
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
The tree of mangrove.

313
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
It's on the water's surface.

314
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
It's on the water's surface.

315
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
It's on the water's surface.

316
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Why are you so...

317
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Why are you so...

318
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Why are you so...

319
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I'm not interested.

320
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I'm not interested.

321
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Everyone's great.

322
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
This is a plant.

323
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Seeds med mood to the water surface.

324
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Seeds med mood to the water surface.

325
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
It's like eggs.

326
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
This seed...

327
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
It's all different in weight.

328
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Some seeds sink deep in the water.

329
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
It's like floating in the middle.

330
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
It's like floating in the middle.

331
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
It's completely different from weight.

332
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
It's like floating in the middle.

333
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
All the seeds are different in weight.

334
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Why?

335
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
It's my memories.

336
00:14:46,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Because the weight of the seed is different, the seeds that flow to the other side are in various places, so in order for the mangrove to expand its territory, the weight of the seed is all different.

337
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
What is this?

338
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Wow, nice to meet you.

339
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
What is it?

340
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Look, there's another book.

341
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
What is this for?

342
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
It's the 10th anniversary of the mangrove's use.

343
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
1000 yen!

344
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I can't see it at all.

345
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
It looks really bad.

346
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
You've been doing this for 10 years?

347
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Yes.

348
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I see.

349
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
It's not sold anywhere.

350
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
This is...

351
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
It's sold.

352
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
It's sold.

353
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Even if Mr. Matsumoto throws a frisbee, why doesn't Mr. Hamada go get it?

354
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
He's coming.

355
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
He's coming, right?

356
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
What do you think this is for?

357
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I don't know.

358
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
You wouldn't understand even if I asked you.

359
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I don't know what you're throwing.

360
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
That's the point.

361
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,000
You don't know that I'm throwing a frisbee, do you?

362
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I don't know.

363
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Actually, I've been throwing 6 frisbees since I came out today.

364
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I don't know when and where you've been throwing them.

365
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Animals...

366
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
You know, there are animals that are often surprised.

367
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
It's a label.

368
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
It doesn't matter if it's a student's ticket or something.

369
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
In the end, it's a bad thing.

370
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
It's not a surprise or anything.

371
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
It's a legacy.

372
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I see.

373
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I'm just doing it because I get food.

374
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
In your case, that's what it's all about.

375
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
It's a lump of greed.

376
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
You're a man.

377
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
You're a man.

378
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
You're a man.

379
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
It's a lump of greed, isn't it?

380
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
You're talking about money.

381
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Don't you have any money?

382
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Don't you have any money?

383
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
If you don't have any money, the vending machine will go off.

384
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I've been throwing frisbees, but I can't go get it.

385
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
It's because there's nothing there.

386
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I see.

387
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
You like burrito teriyaki, don't you?

388
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,000
If you give me a burrito teriyaki when I come to get a frisbee,

389
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
You're not a glutton.

390
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
It's a lump of greed.

391
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
If you're a Hamada Obu leader...

392
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Hamada Obu leader...

393
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,000
But don't expect anything in return.

394
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Why are you angry?

395
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
There's nothing in return in this world.

396
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Wait, wait, wait.

397
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
What are you talking about?

398
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
It's about frisbees.

399
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Actually, I've never seen you throw it.

400
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:03,000
In the end, I expect something in return, so I can't see it.

401
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I can't see anything.

402
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
What are you talking about?

403
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
You expect something in return, don't you?

404
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I don't.

405
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I'm sure you do.

406
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I'm sure you do.

407
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
How about this frisbee?

408
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
How about the frisbee?

409
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I don't know.

410
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Okay, then.

411
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,000
What do you use the frisbee for?

412
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
You can't be honest with me.

413
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
You can't be honest with me.

414
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
That's right.

415
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
This is it.

416
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
It smells like this.

417
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
When I'm done, I'll take off my jacket and say,

418
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
This is 2 million yen.

419
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Are you saying that?

420
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Are you saying that?

421
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
You're saying that, aren't you?

422
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
That's what I want you to fix.

423
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
You expect something in return, don't you?

424
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I don't expect anything in return.

425
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
It doesn't matter if you don't have anything.

426
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
There's no rain that doesn't stop.

427
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
There's no jeans that you don't wear.

428
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I don't wear jeans.

429
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Let's stop the life of a dweller.

430
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
What do you mean?

431
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
If you give this to someone,

432
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I'm sure something like this will come back.

433
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I didn't mean that.

434
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
That's strange.

435
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I'm glad I was halfway through.

436
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
The way to the jeeper is a little different.

437
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
There were about three different ways.

438
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I chose the wrong way.

439
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
If you go to the first one, you'll go the wrong way.

440
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Star's money-sensitive corner

441
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
What's that?

442
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
This is that, isn't it?

443
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:54,000
How do you not forget the feelings of the general public?

444
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I think it's going to be a guide.

445
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
You don't know, do you?

446
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
What's that?

447
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Do you know how much it is now?

448
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I know.

449
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
How much is it?

450
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
It's 110 yen, isn't it?

451
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
No, no, no, no.

452
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
It's 110 yen, isn't it?

453
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:34,000
How many years ago?

454
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I'm so scared right now.

455
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
I was put in a dark room.

456
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
I'm so scared.

457
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
It's different.

458
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Everyone's eyes are shining.

459
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
How much is it?

460
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
It's 10 yen, isn't it?

461
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Was it 120 yen?

462
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Since when?

463
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Since April.

464
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Since April?

465
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
I think I know that much.

466
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
How much is cabbage now?

467
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Do you know?

468
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I know.

469
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
I know.

470
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:13,000
How much is a carrot with four carrots?

471
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
How much is it?

472
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I don't even know.

473
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
One carrot is about 120 yen.

474
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:24,000
What?

475
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:29,000
I'm saying it like a rabbit.

476
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
It's like a rabbit.

477
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,000
If I'm a rabbit.

478
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:40,000
No one knows what a rabbit feels like.

479
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,000
That's what I'm saying.

480
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Actually, everyone is different.

481
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Is everyone different?

482
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
It's different, but it's not the right answer.

483
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Why not?

484
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Why are you getting stronger and stronger?

485
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I'm scared.

486
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
But I'm sure I'm shopping.

487
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Because I'm the only one.

488
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I shop at a convenience store.

489
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
That may be the case.

490
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Do you know how much a house is?

491
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
You don't know, do you?

492
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
It's less than 200 yen.

493
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
I don't know that much.

494
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
It's about 170 yen.

495
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Is that so?

496
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:20,000
No, it's an Indian sense.

497
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
If you say that, I can say anything.

498
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Is there anything you can say?

499
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
I can't say.

500
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
What do you do when you can say it?

501
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,000
What?

502
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Let's start with a child's play.

503
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:40,000
I'd like to ask Mr. Masumoto, who has the talent for writing and composing.

504
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Let me hear you sing the famous songs of the prefecture of Japan.

505
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
I'm good at that.

506
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Is that so?

507
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
As an example,

508
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Potatoes are delicious in Hokkaido.

509
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Why don't you put a song on this?

510
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Potatoes are delicious in Hokkaido.

511
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Potatoes are delicious in Hokkaido.

512
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:19,000
How many seconds have passed?

513
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
How many seconds have passed?

514
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I haven't seen it yet.

515
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
What do you want me to say?

516
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Do it.

517
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
How do you want me to do it?

518
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Say something you're good at.

519
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
I can say anything.

520
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
If you say anything, it's going to be weird again.

521
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Potatoes are delicious in Hokkaido.

522
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
I can say 50 different things with this.

523
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:50,000
That's a good pattern.

524
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Potatoes are delicious in Hokkaido.

525
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Potatoes are delicious in Hokkaido.

526
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Potatoes are delicious in Hokkaido.

527
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:19,000
My head is getting bigger.

528
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:25,000
This program was brought to you by these sponsors.
