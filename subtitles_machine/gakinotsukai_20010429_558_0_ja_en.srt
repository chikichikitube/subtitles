1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Before the recording, he is the only one who is not seen in the usual dressing room.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Excuse me.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Well, Mr. Yamazaki told me to bring everyone here.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Why?

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I don't know.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
It's a serious matter.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
When did he say he would come?

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Well, I don't know.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Let's just say that.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
What's wrong with Mr. Yamazaki?

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
He seems to be depressed.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
He can't be in the drama.

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
He can't be in Lee's Japan.

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
He seems to be thinking about something.

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I don't think about it.

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Do we have to bring everyone here?

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Yes.

18
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Where should we bring everyone?

19
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Mr. Yamazaki is here.

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I don't know.

21
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
We don't have to bring everyone here.

22
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Can we bring Taro too?

23
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Can we bring him too?

24
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Yes.

25
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Let's bring everyone here.

26
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Excuse me.

27
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:02,000
It's a serious matter.

28
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
This program is brought to you by these sponsors.

29
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Excuse me.

30
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
This way.

31
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Excuse me.

32
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Yes.

33
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm really worried.

34
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
What's the matter?

35
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
What's the matter?

36
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Did something happen?

37
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
To be honest,

38
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I'm an entertainer.

39
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
When I do various things,

40
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
there is a moment when God descends.

41
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
But God doesn't descend at all.

42
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The God of laughter.

43
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Only those who stepped into the world of laughter

44
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
experience the miracle of birth.

45
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
The moment when the God of laughter descends.

46
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
It seems that Yamazaki was separated from that God.

47
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I used to be there.

48
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
For example, the Moriman battle.

49
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
In the Moriman battle,

50
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
the beer bottle was like this.

51
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Do you remember the battle with Morio?

52
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Even at that time,

53
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I didn't think about anything.

54
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
The beer bottle flew away.

55
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
When I shook it up.

56
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Yamazaki vs. Moriman beer bottle battle.

57
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Yamazaki shook up the beer bottle

58
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
in the ring where the God of laughter descends.

59
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
The beer bottle went to the ring in front of the center.

60
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
The audience was caught in the water of laughter.

61
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
At that time,

62
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
the God of laughter certainly descended to Yamazaki.

63
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
A lot of such gods have descended.

64
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
If you think about it,

65
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
there were some in the past.

66
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
That's right.

67
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
That's enough.

68
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I'm sorry.

69
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Put the chairs here.

70
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Wait a minute.

71
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Wait a minute.

72
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Komu.

73
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Komu.

74
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Why do you call Komu Komu?

75
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I don't understand.

76
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Komu is a staff.

77
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
This.

78
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Komu has the same taste.

79
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Do you remember this?

80
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Matsumoto-san.

81
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
At the time of the previous Giri.

82
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
At the end,

83
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
he really went up one step.

84
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
That's right.

85
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
That's right.

86
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
That's the God who descended.

87
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
That's right.

88
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
At the end of the last Giri,

89
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:21,000
the order came to Matsumoto.

90
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
It's amazing.

91
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
What is this?

92
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
And the last moment.

93
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
This is exactly the moment when the God of laughter descended.

94
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
That's it.

95
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
It's the greatest weapon that comedians need.

96
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Shall I try it?

97
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
With this.

98
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Look.

99
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
What are you looking at?

100
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Naki-san.

101
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
What are you looking at?

102
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
What are you looking at?

103
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I'm not looking.

104
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
No, no, no.

105
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
If the God descended,

106
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
he would have gone up one step.

107
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
If you say that in this country,

108
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
it would be one step.

109
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Really.

110
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
That's right. You'd be surprised.

111
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
You'd be surprised, right?

112
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Shall I try it again?

113
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Yes.

114
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Look.

115
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Look.

116
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
What?

117
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Well, it's nothing.

118
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I see.

119
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
But, Yamazaki-san.

120
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
What's the probability?

121
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
There are many.

122
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
It's not a matter of probability.

123
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Come on.

124
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
What?

125
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Bring it to me.

126
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
There are many black keys.

127
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
There are many holes.

128
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
This is a little...

129
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
It's a little crazy.

130
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
That's right.

131
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
So, this is

132
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
wasabi Russian sushi.

133
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I see.

134
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
There are many.

135
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
There are many wasabi.

136
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Yes.

137
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
It's in here.

138
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
In here.

139
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Only one?

140
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Only one.

141
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
There is a lot of wasabi in here.

142
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I don't know what it looks like.

143
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
You don't know what it looks like at all.

144
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Yes.

145
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Right?

146
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I'll try it.

147
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Yes.

148
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
That's right.

149
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
If the God descended.

150
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
If the God descended.

151
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
You can react immediately.

152
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
That's right.

153
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Yes.

154
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
It's good.

155
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
What?

156
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
What?

157
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
It's funny.

158
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Is it really good?

159
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
It's not funny.

160
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Don't be angry.

161
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
No, no, no.

162
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
But...

163
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I'm sure that

164
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
there is one here.

165
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
No, no, no.

166
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
That's Yamazaki.

167
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
There is one here.

168
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
It's difficult.

169
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
It's difficult.

170
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
In the past.

171
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
After all.

172
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
So, in the past,

173
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I was definitely

174
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
doing wasabi.

175
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Even if I didn't do it,

176
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
something happened.

177
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Yes.

178
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I was definitely laughing.

179
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I was definitely laughing.

180
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Come on.

181
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
What?

182
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Come on.

183
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
What is this?

184
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Ah.

185
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
This is probably

186
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Yes.

187
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
1 in 2.

188
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
1 in 2.

189
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
It's 50%.

190
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
It's either.

191
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
It's either.

192
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Yes.

193
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
This is.

194
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I'll choose this.

195
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I don't know what it looks like at all.

196
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I don't know at all.

197
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I really don't know.

198
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
It hurts.

199
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
It hurts.

200
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
It hurts.

201
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
It hurts.

202
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
It hurts.

203
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
It hurts.

204
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Ah.

205
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Ah.

206
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Here?

207
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Here?

208
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Wow.

209
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
It's disgusting.

210
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Wait a minute.

211
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Wait a minute.

212
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Wait a minute.

213
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Wait a minute.

214
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Wait a minute.

215
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Wait a minute.

216
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I thought it was fun.

217
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Well, well.

218
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Well, well, well.

219
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Well, well, well.

220
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Well, well, well.

221
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Well, well, well.

222
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Well, well, well.

223
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Even if we do it,

224
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I don't know.

225
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
No, no, no.

226
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I'm definitely going to go to Nikon

227
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
with wasabi.

228
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Definitely.

229
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Definitely.

230
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
It's history of comedy.

231
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
It's history of comedy.

232
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Well, there's even edit this and that,

233
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
You know?

234
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Because there are other things.

235
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I'd like to flee to Nagata.

236
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I think it's all real.

237
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I think it's all real.

238
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I think it's all real.

239
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I think it's all real.

240
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I think it's all real.

241
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I think it's all real.

242
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I think it's all real.

243
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
But.

244
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Hey,

245
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
When I was a kid,

246
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
If I didn't feel like thisWho caught.

247
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
No, it's

248
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I'm just saying in style.

249
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I'm just saying in style.

250
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I don't feel like this in the past.

251
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Don't care about comedy show.

252
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I can't even think about it now!

253
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Is that what you're thinking?

254
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I thought you were going to say it later

255
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I thought about it too much

256
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
What is it this time?

257
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
You know this, right?

258
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
The zoo

259
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I thought about it, but

260
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I'll just open it up

261
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
and say, I'm going to buy this animal!

262
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I'll point at it like this

263
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Right?

264
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
In the past, it was a really good animal

265
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
It was an interesting animal

266
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
It was

267
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Let's do it

268
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I'm going to do it

269
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Right now

270
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I'm going to buy this!

271
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Where's the character?

272
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
It's the eyes

273
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
The eyes of the fox

274
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
The four foxes

275
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
The four foxes

276
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Don't you know what that means?

277
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I don't know

278
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
It's a bit too much

279
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
It's a bit too much

280
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Please try it

281
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
It's too negative

282
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Please try it

283
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I'll try it

284
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I've been buying it for about two months

285
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
It's hard to feed it

286
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
It's this

287
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
It's the earth!

288
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
It's hard to feed it

289
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I'm going to buy it in Africa

290
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Right?

291
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
If it was me

292
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
It would be like this

293
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Right?

294
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I'm going to the earth

295
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I've been buying it for about two months

296
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
It's hard to feed it

297
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
In Africa

298
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
It's okay

299
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Don't worry about it

300
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I have something to say

301
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Wait a minute

302
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
What is it?

303
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Look

304
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
It's magic

305
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Out of the three

306
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I can't draw only one

307
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I can't draw only one

308
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I see

309
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I'm going to do magic

310
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I'm going to draw a beard

311
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I can't draw only one

312
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I can't draw only one

313
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Right?

314
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
It's more likely than before

315
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I'm going to draw

316
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Please

317
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Bring me a mirror

318
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Bring me a mirror

319
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Did you say mirror?

320
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
What?

321
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
What?

322
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
What?

323
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
What?

324
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Did you draw it?

325
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Did you succeed?

326
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
It's funny

327
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
What?

328
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
It's not funny at all

329
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
To be honest

330
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I wanted to draw something that I can't draw

331
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
That's right

332
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
That's right

333
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
According to the theory

334
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
There are a lot of people who can't draw

335
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
But

336
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Why can't you draw?

337
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Why can't you draw?

338
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I get angry and laugh

339
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
It's a pattern

340
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Did you draw it now?

341
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I wanted to draw a beard

342
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I wanted to draw a beard

343
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
You took off your hair too much

344
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I'm sorry

345
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I'm sorry

346
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
What is it?

347
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I drew it

348
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
What is it?

349
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Crab

350
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Crab

351
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Crab

352
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Put it between the nose

353
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
If the crab put it between the nose

354
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
It will be good

355
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I'll try

356
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Oops

357
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I'm looking forward to this

358
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
It's like this

359
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I didn't expect it

360
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
It looks good

361
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
It looks really good

362
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Ouch

363
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
It looks good

364
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
What is it?

365
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
It hurts

366
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I think I can do it

367
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Please do your best

368
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I think I can do it

369
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Ouch

370
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
It's coming

371
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
It's coming

372
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
It's coming

373
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
It's coming

374
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
It's good

375
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
It's funny

376
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
It's funny

377
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
It would be good if you put wasabi here

378
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
It's delicious

379
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Crab wasabi

380
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
It was delicious

381
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
It was delicious

382
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I can't help it

383
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Is it okay?

384
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
For the time being

385
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Wait a minute

386
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
It looks good

387
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
It looks good

388
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Crab

389
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Fujiwara was funny

390
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Fujiwara was funny

391
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
It's stuck

392
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
This is interesting

393
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
This

394
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I don't know which one has power

395
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I see

396
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I'll set it up

397
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I'll choose from these three

398
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
It's a vacuum cleaner

399
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Put it here

400
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
What are you doing?

401
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
It's amazing

402
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Which one?

403
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:17,000
It's in the middle

404
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Put it down

405
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Put it down

406
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Hurry up

407
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Hurry up

408
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Hurry up

409
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
One

410
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
One

411
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Put it all down

412
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Put it down

413
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Put it down

414
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
It's dangerous

415
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I put it all down

416
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Put it up

417
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
It's happening

418
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
It's happening

419
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
It's interesting

420
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
If it's wasabi

421
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
If it's wasabi

422
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
It's amazing

423
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Is there more?

424
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
What is it?

425
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
It's a lot

426
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
You know this

427
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
You know

428
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I have scissors

429
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
In this

430
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Only one will fall

431
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I'll go

432
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I'll go in the middle

433
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
No

434
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
It's okay

435
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I'll go

436
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Sushi

437
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I'll try

438
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Let's do it again

439
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
There are four more

440
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
There are four more

441
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I'll choose

442
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I'll eat it

443
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I'll eat it

444
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Let's do it again

445
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
It's okay

446
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
It's one of the three

447
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I think you can do it

448
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
It's okay

449
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
It's okay

450
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
It doesn't matter

451
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
It's okay

452
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
It was this

453
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I thought it would be this

454
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
You can't do it

455
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Let's do it outside

456
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Why?

457
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
If you're a comedy god

458
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
You can't come in

459
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
You're saying amazing things

460
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I don't think so

461
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I usually eat in the studio

462
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
You can't come in

463
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Sushi

464
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:19,000
You can't come in

465
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
There's nothing

466
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Even a kid who likes to play

467
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Can't come to the park

468
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
You know

469
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Even the god of weather

470
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Is allowed to come

471
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I'm talking but the train is running

472
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
You

473
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
You can't hear me

474
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
There are buttons from 1 to 10

475
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
There are buttons from 1 to 10

476
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
And

477
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
One of the buttons

478
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Is connected here

479
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Fireworks are coming out

480
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
It's interesting

481
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
If you put it down

482
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
You'll know

483
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
What happens when you put it down

484
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
It's like a black beard

485
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
That's why it's a black beard

486
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Monkey

487
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I didn't think of it

488
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
If it blows

489
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Please come in

490
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Sushi

491
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Let's bring it

492
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Let's bring it

493
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Let's bring it

494
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Let's bring it

495
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Let's go

496
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
From 1 to 10

497
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
First

498
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Let's go to 8

499
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
8

500
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Please

501
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Right?

502
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
It's difficult

503
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
It's difficult

504
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
But the god

505
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Is watching

506
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Really?

507
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
If it comes in the first time

508
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
It means the god came

509
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
But if it comes in the last time

510
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
It's amazing

511
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I see

512
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Let's take it

513
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Let's take it

514
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
8 is no good

515
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Let's go to 4

516
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
4

517
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
It came

518
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Sorry

519
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Are you okay?

520
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
It came

521
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
It came

522
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
It came here

523
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
It came here

524
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Let's go back

525
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Let's go back

526
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
What's this?

527
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
What's next?

528
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
It's like a crab

529
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I don't have it

530
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
This

531
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I like it

532
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
It's in the water

533
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
In the end

534
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
The god

535
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
It's in the water

536
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I see

537
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
This

538
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
What's this?

539
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
It's two

540
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
One has

541
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
A goldfish

542
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
And the other one

543
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Has a snake

544
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
That's scary

545
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
But

546
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
You know

547
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I know

548
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
We've done a lot

549
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
But this is the last

550
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Let's do it

551
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Let's do it

552
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Will Yamazaki

553
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Be able to catch the snake?

554
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Hello

555
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
He's laughing

556
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
It's his feeling

557
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
He's laughing

558
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
How is it?

559
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
It's good

560
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
It's the last

561
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Let's go

562
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
It's coming

563
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:17,000
It's coming

564
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
It's coming

565
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Please do it again

566
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Hello

567
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Hello

568
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Hello

569
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Hello

570
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Hello

571
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Hello

572
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Hello

573
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Hello

574
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Hello

575
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Hello

576
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
I said

577
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Hello

578
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
I'm very thankful for the support

579
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
But I think I'm going to die

580
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
He came out again

581
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
From a sad story

582
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
It's coming

583
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
It's coming

584
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
It's coming

585
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
It's coming

586
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
It's coming

587
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Ah

588
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,000
That's when you entered the show

589
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
There's drama

590
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Yes

591
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
When you're shooting

592
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Why do you think that?

593
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
You look very tired

594
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Everyone does

595
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I don't work out

596
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
I got muscle pain

597
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
It's strange

598
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
You're fine

599
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
No, no, I don't want to say it too much.

600
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
It's just that, you know, even if there's a lot of customers, it's like that.

601
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
What's so strange about it?

602
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Overall, it's strange.

603
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Overall, there's nothing wrong about it.

604
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I don't get it.

605
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Please come.

606
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
No, no, if it's open, I'll come.

607
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Even if I die, everyone will come, right?

608
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Even if you say it like that.

609
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
No, that's because everyone's on a schedule.

610
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Ah, so that's why you're wearing a mask now.

611
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
But I can't get out of this.

612
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Why not?

613
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
I'll come.

614
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Bring some okaki, really.

615
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
I'm sorry.

616
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Okaki and Hanataba.

617
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Eh? Okaki?

618
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Okaki.

619
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Hard okaki and Hanataba.

620
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Thank you very much.

621
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Even though I didn't eat it.

622
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Matsumoto-san, who is a beginner in the Japanese Tank Top League.

623
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:41,000
At this time, even if you're walking around with a tank top on, please tell me a way that people won't think that you're running away.

624
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
This is because, even now, everyone, you know...

625
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Even now, girls, even in winter, their shoulders are out.

626
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

627
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Recently, summer and winter have disappeared.

628
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I see.

629
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Yes.

630
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Well, that doesn't really matter.

631
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Well, yes.

632
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:04,000
But, well, there's a way. There's a way to say it in a way that's not rude.

633
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
A way to say it?

634
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,000
A woman is like a clash between jealousy and jealousy, right?

635
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Like, I don't like that girl.

636
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,000
A man is rather casual, but a woman is like, I don't like that girl.

637
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
A woman who's a little popular is jealous.

638
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
I see.

639
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
A woman is like, I'm inviting a man who's rude.

640
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
I see.

641
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Like that, right away.

642
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
A woman is scary.

643
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Yes.

644
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
A woman will resent you.

645
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Yes.

646
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
No, no.

647
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Ah, yes, yes.

648
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
That's why, you know, tank tops.

649
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Yes.

650
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Tank tops or anything is fine.

651
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Yes.

652
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
When you wear something like that, you add a little something to it.

653
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Ah, she's not such a bad girl.

654
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:46,000
For example, when you wear a jacket like this, and when you meet at a cafe, when you take it off, your shoulders pop out.

655
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:53,000
At that time, you're in trouble, you're short of sleeves.

656
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
That's right.

657
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:00,000
You're short of sleeves.

658
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Because of that, this girl might become a best friend.

659
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
What?

660
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
She might become a best friend?

661
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Yes.

662
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,000
A lifelong best friend.

663
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:23,000
