1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
After this, it's time for Gaki no Tsukai Yarahen.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
It's over.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
You change your weight every day.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I can tell from the bottom.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
The third episode of Gaki no Tsukai Yarahen.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Hit the chicken with a bat and see how many points you get.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
This is the third episode.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
We've been talking about men.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
This is the first time we're talking about women.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Today's guest is a scary one.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Please bring her in.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
What kind of clothes is this?

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
What should we do? She's a woman.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
She's a woman.

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
If you kiss her on the cheek, you get 50 points.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Do you kiss her on the back of the hand?

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'll give her 20 points.

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
What kind of hand is this?

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
5 points on the cheek.

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
If you kiss her on the mouth, you get more than 50 points.

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Can you kiss her on the mouth?

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
You said it.

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I don't know.

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
That's about it.

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
What else can you think of?

26
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Let's dig her shoes.

27
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
It's a lot of work to dig shoes.

28
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
It's a lot of work.

29
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
She's scary.

30
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
If you dig her shoes, you get 10,000 points.

31
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
It's more than a kiss.

32
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
What else?

33
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
If you throw it.

34
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
If you throw it.

35
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
If you throw it.

36
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
If you throw it.

37
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
How many points do you get?

38
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I'll go home.

39
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I can't participate.

40
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,000
If you can put her body in a half-transparent garbage bag.

41
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I'll give you 20,000 points.

42
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I'll give you 20,000 points.

43
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I'll give you a chance.

44
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
What kind of chance?

45
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I'll give you a chance to dance lightly.

46
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Who?

47
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I will.

48
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
You?

49
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Okay.

50
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I'd like to talk to her now.

51
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Good evening.

52
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I'm Masumoto from downtown.

53
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I'm Hamada.

54
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Today, we're going to talk about actress Kaga Mariko Hansen.

55
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
She's our senior.

56
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I think there's a lot to learn from her.

57
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Let's invite her to the stage.

58
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Today's guest is Kaga Mariko.

59
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Good evening.

60
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I'm famous Kaga Mariko.

61
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Good evening.

62
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
You're here like a hero.

63
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
What do you mean?

64
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I don't know.

65
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I'm Catherine de Nouveau.

66
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I didn't see you.

67
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
It hurts.

68
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
You're always like that, right?

69
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Don't be like that.

70
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
It's okay.

71
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Have you been standing there all this time?

72
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Please sit down.

73
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I'm worried about you.

74
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Today, we're going to talk about actress Kaga Mariko Hansen.

75
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
No.

76
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I'm not going to talk about her.

77
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Why?

78
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I'm not ready yet.

79
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
It hurts.

80
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
How many years have you been in the entertainment industry?

81
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I've never been in the entertainment industry.

82
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
You're in your teens, right?

83
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Is that so?

84
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
How long have you been in the entertainment industry?

85
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I didn't start in my fifties.

86
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
You've been in the entertainment industry for a long time, haven't you?

87
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
No, I haven't.

88
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
You're normal.

89
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
You're a disgusting man.

90
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I don't like you.

91
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
It hurts.

92
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
What's wrong with him?

93
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
No, no, no.

94
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Thank you very much.

95
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
You're dirty.

96
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
You're dirty.

97
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
You're like a sloth to me.

98
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I'm sorry.

99
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
What are you doing?

100
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I'm sorry.

101
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I'm really sorry.

102
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I want to talk to you properly.

103
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Does anyone have a swimming suit?

104
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
It's your choice.

105
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Did you buy these shoes yourself?

106
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Can I show you?

107
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
No.

108
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Please.

109
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I don't like you.

110
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Please show me.

111
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Please show me.

112
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I'm sorry.

113
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Let me put it on.

114
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
You are.

115
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Stop it.

116
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I'm pretending to be asleep.

117
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I'm really sorry.

118
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
What's wrong with you?

119
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I'm sorry.

120
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
When I talked to Kaga-san,

121
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,000
the half-transparent garbage bag was a hot topic.

122
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Did you complain?

123
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I didn't complain.

124
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I didn't complain.

125
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I have something here.

126
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
It's something like this.

127
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
It's not something to play with.

128
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Who do you think you are?

129
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I'm sorry.

130
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I'm really sorry.

131
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Call the producer.

132
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I'm sorry.

133
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Kaga-san has become a leader.

134
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Do you have some tea?

135
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I don't need it.

136
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I'm sorry.

137
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Do you have a sore throat?

138
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
What is that?

139
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Kaga-san.

140
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
This is a weapon.

141
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
This is a weapon.

142
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Kaga-san, I have something here.

143
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Kaga-san.

144
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I'm sorry.

145
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I'm tired.

146
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Let's go home.

147
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Don't let your guard down.

148
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
You.

149
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
What are you doing while I'm looking at you?

150
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I want to touch you.

151
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Let's hold hands.

152
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I don't want to hold hands.

153
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
You don't want to hold hands?

154
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I don't want to hold hands.

155
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Where is it?

156
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
This is amazing.

157
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
This is amazing.

158
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
This is a glass.

159
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Is that so?

160
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
This is amazing.

161
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Do you have bad eyesight?

162
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I don't have bad eyesight.

163
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:39,000
This is a fashionable outfit today.

164
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
What did you want to do?

165
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
What did you want to do?

166
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
You wanted to carry me on your back.

167
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I wanted to try throwing you on my back.

168
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Shall we get on your back?

169
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
This is amazing.

170
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Hold it properly.

171
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,000
What should I do from now on?

172
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Thank you very much.

173
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
It was Kaga-san.

174
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Let's announce the results.

175
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
The hard fight is over.

176
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I changed my bad habit.

177
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I don't want to imitate Chibikko.

178
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Let's announce the results.

179
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Let's start with Matsumoto-san.

180
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:31,000
What is Matsumoto-san's score?

181
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
1390 points.

182
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
1390 points.

183
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
This is zero.

184
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
1390 points.

185
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
This is amazing.

186
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,000
What is my score?

187
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
3580 points.

188
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
What is my score?

189
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Matsumoto-san's score is 10000 points.

190
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
That's all I got.

191
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
No way.

192
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
My father's score is only 50 points.

193
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Really?

194
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Why did you get 30,000 points?

195
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I threw my shoes away.

196
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I covered them with plastic.

197
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
That's not true.

198
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:17,000
That's why my score was high.

199
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Your score is only 10000 points.

200
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Kaga-san's score is only 50 points.

201
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I threw my shoes away.

202
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:03,000
That's all I got.

203
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
That's enough.

204
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Welcome.

205
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
It's been a long time since I saw you.

206
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I didn't want to say it.

207
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I didn't start it now.

208
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I forgot my name when I came here.

209
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I can't say it.

210
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Why don't you say it?

211
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I've been thinking about it for a long time.

212
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I can't let them do it.

213
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
They have nothing to do with it.

214
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,000
They can do whatever they want.

215
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
That's true.

216
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
You have to think about it.

217
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I won't say it.

218
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
You won't say it?

219
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I won't say it.

220
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
You won't say it?

221
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Who are you?

222
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Why are you talking to me?

223
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
We are guests.

224
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I'm talking naturally.

225
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
This is the first time.

226
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I was thinking about it.

227
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I can't say it.

228
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I think you can think about it.

229
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I can think about it.

230
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I'm in a group.

231
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I'm a vocalist.

232
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I'm fat.

233
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I'm ugly.

234
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I'm wearing a mini skirt.

235
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I'm a vocalist.

236
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Is it that bad?

237
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Look at me.

238
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
You're pretty popular.

239
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I can tell from your face.

240
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Why are all the famous musicians ugly?

241
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I can't say it.

242
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I can't say it to everyone.

243
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I'm sorry.

244
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,000
You often say it like that.

245
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I don't say it.

246
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
You just said it.

247
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,000
You don't have a chance to meet people like that.

248
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Wait a minute.

249
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I don't attack people like that.

250
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I'm being called ugly.

251
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Who are you talking to?

252
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
You're just saying it.

253
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I haven't seen anyone who is not ugly.

254
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I don't think I'm that kind of person.

255
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
You seem to have unpleasant thoughts.

256
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I think so.

257
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I don't.

258
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Really?

259
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
What's unpleasant about watching TV?

260
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I think it's okay.

261
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I don't understand.

262
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Why?

263
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
He's being called a good person.

264
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
He's not a good person at all.

265
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Wait a minute.

266
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
What?

267
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Do you know it well?

268
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I know it well.

269
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
You just say it by the appearance of the TV.

270
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
No, he's a bad guy.

271
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
You should remember it.

272
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
About 6 or 7 years ago,

273
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
when I was not known in Tokyo or Osaka,

274
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I did a hit parade of the New Year's program.

275
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
At the Meiji Jingu?

276
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
At the Meiji Jingu.

277
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I was asked to do a manzai in front of the audience.

278
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Yes.

279
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Before that, I was asked to show what kind of story I was going to do.

280
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I said, you can't do that now.

281
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I said, hey.

282
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I went to the CX.

283
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I said, good morning.

284
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
You said it right.

285
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I said it right.

286
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
You changed a lot.

287
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
You changed a lot.

288
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
When I went to the CX,

289
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
no matter what kind of story I showed,

290
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
it was like this at that time.

291
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I did it.

292
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
At that time, I liked baseball the most.

293
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I wanted to do baseball story.

294
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
That's okay.

295
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I wanted you to do a story other than baseball story.

296
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
What?

297
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I asked why.

298
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
It was the same.

299
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I wanted to do a baseball story.

300
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
It was the same.

301
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
That's why I told you to go home.

302
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
It's not their fault.

303
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
It's their fault.

304
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Why are we doing this?

305
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,000
It's the fault of that rotten comedian.

306
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Anyway, I wanted you to change the story.

307
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
What kind of story?

308
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
What kind of story?

309
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
What kind of story?

310
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
On that day, I went to Amazing on New Year's Day.

311
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I was on standby early in the morning.

312
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Early in the morning.

313
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
An hour ago.

314
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
An hour ago.

315
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Even though it was early.

316
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Amazing.

317
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I can't think of it now.

318
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I can't think of it now.

319
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,000
It was like a microbus.

320
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
It was like a microbus.

321
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
What are you doing?

322
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
It's true.

323
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
It's fine.

324
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
It's fine like this.

325
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
What is this?

326
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
It was amazing.

327
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
It's true.

328
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
It's a good guy.

329
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
It's a lie.

330
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
It's fine like that.

331
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
And then,

332
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I said,

333
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I said,

334
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Good morning.

335
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I'm a senior.

336
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Right?

337
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
And I'm older.

338
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
But I said,

339
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Good morning.

340
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I said,

341
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Good morning.

342
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,000
What are you doing?

343
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
At this time,

344
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Are you going to make an egg?

345
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Susa!

346
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Susa!

347
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I'm scared.

348
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Is it from the pocket?

349
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Susa!

350
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Shut up!

351
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
And then,

352
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
There are many kinds of comic books.

353
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
There are many kinds of comic books.

354
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
For those who are watching,

355
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
It may not matter.

356
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Who goes first?

357
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Who goes first?

358
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
It's OK for me to be a senior,

359
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
But it's humiliating.

360
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I'm going to be the one to be hurt.

361
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I'm going to be the one to be hurt.

362
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I was replaced by

363
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I was replaced by

364
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Well,

365
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I was replaced by

366
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Well,

367
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Get out!

368
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Baseball!

369
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
You returned the story to me.

370
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
You returned the story to me.

371
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I said hello.

372
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I said hello.

373
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I made a paper cigarette.

374
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I made a paper cigarette.

375
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
What kind of story are you giving in?

376
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I made a paper cigarette.

377
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
What kind of story are you giving in?

378
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I was surprised.

379
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
But that's fine.

380
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Even if I say, good work, he'll blow again.

381
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,000
What are you doing?

382
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
You came with a microphone when you came.

383
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Don't go home.

384
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Don't make me laugh.

385
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I can't tell you how he is.

386
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Why?

387
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
He was popular when he came.

388
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I don't know why he became like this.

389
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I really hate this kind of person.

390
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
It's the worst to be a bad person.

391
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
What?

392
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Is it true?

393
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Is it me?

394
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Is it me?

395
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I said it once before.

396
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I didn't say it because I didn't support him.

397
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I said it once.

398
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
You said it in a bad way.

399
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I didn't say it in a bad way.

400
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Really?

401
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I said it.

402
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
He's a person who comes right away.

403
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
He's strong.

404
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
He's strong.

405
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I was in the back of the school.

406
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I hate it.

407
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
He's always like this.

408
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,000
He's doing shadow.

409
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Hey!

410
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Hey!

411
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Hey!

412
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,000
We're the same age.

413
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
He's older than me.

414
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I'm the same age.

415
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I didn't say anything bad about him.

416
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I don't have the right to say that.

417
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I don't think I can win.

418
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I think I can win.

419
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I think I can win.

420
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
He said he was talking about me.

421
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I didn't say anything.

422
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
What?

423
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
For now.

424
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
For now, I didn't say anything.

425
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
He's a bad person.

426
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I thought he was going to say something bad next time.

427
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Next time?

428
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I thought he was going to say something bad next time.

429
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
You.

430
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I said it next time.

431
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Do you know what happens if you make me angry?

432
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
You're here.

433
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I said it.

434
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
You said it.

435
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Yes.

436
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,000
What?

437
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Three times!

438
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Three times.

439
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
You said it three times!

440
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Three times!

441
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
No way!

442
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
It's the third time!

443
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
You!

444
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
What are you talking about?

445
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,000
If you and I fight,

446
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
you're gonna be an adult and little kid.

447
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Is that so?

448
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
That's so annoying!

449
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
If you and I fight, you're gonna be an adult and.....

450
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I'm the little kid.

451
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Pachi- Pachi-

452
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
You don't need to say it!

453
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I'll be careful from now on!

454
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Sorry...

455
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
No, this is...

456
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
This is because I'm bad

457
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Ah, because you said it

458
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Yes, yes, I said it wrong

459
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Ah, I see, I see

460
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Because I said it wrong, you got mad

461
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
You can't say anything if you got mad

462
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
That's right!

463
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,000
For example, if I say something bad on TV,

464
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I'll be like...

465
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Wait, wait

466
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Say that you're not going to shut up

467
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I'll be like...

468
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
At that time, I'll be like...

469
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
What are you talking about?

470
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
What are you talking about?

471
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,000
This is the photo that was at the Victoria Museum in Canada

472
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
This is the photo that was at the Victoria Museum in Canada

473
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
What kind of picture is this?

474
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
This is me, right?

475
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Yes

476
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Look at the person near the monitor, it's similar, right?

477
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Then, I'll be the one to shut up

478
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I'll be the one to shut up

479
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
This is similar!

480
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
It's similar!

481
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
That's it

482
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
It's the time when my Masao will be okay

483
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
What?

484
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Hello, I have a question for the best Japanese teacher, Matsumoto

485
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I took a pen

486
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:42,000
From autumn to winter, I often see birds flying in a row in the western sky in V-shape and Y-shape

487
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Does that have any meaning?

488
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Is it a code to people?

489
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
If it's a code...

490
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
I'm saying this because I know how to write it

491
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
What is it?

492
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Birds don't want to say anything to humans

493
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
That's not true

494
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
I don't want to say anything

495
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Birds fly in a circle

496
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Birds fly in a circle

497
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
It's a correction

498
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
What?

499
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
That's not true

500
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
It's not true?

501
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
It's the trend of this year

502
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
It's a fashion

503
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Fashion?

504
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
This year, V-neck will be popular

505
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
The birds are telling me

506
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
This year, V-neck will be popular

507
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Good morning

508
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
What?

509
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
You have a lot of savings

510
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I'm comparing your savings

511
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Are you asking me about my father?

512
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
I know this

513
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
What is it?

514
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
It's the same

515
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
It's the same

516
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
It's the same

517
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Is that so?

518
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
I'm sorry

519
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:26,000
I'm sorry
