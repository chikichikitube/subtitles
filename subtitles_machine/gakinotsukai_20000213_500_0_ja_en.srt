1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Today we have a new character, Ryo Koi!

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Today is the 500th episode of Gaki no Chikai.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
It's a special occasion.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
A special occasion?

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
We have a new character.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Really?

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Are you sure?

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Are you sure?

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Is this the same as the previous episode?

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Yes, it is.

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
You appear as a demon.

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
That's right.

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Last year I was in Dancing Baby.

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I was in the break.

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I was in the 5th episode of Yamazaki.

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
This time...

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Child Playro!

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Ready...

19
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Chucky!

20
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Don't make a fuss.

21
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
The rule is to use all the floors.

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Chucky will catch everyone.

23
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
What will happen?

24
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Help me!

25
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Help me!

26
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
This program is brought to you by the following sponsors.

27
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
If you don't know Chucky...

28
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
If you don't know Chucky...

29
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
It's dangerous.

30
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
It's okay.

31
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
This is for those who don't know Chucky.

32
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Why?

33
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Please take a look.

34
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Child Playro was a big hit all over the world as a horror film.

35
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,000
The shocking story of a doll that was given to him on his birthday suddenly attacking people...

36
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
...caused terror throughout the world.

37
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
And this doll is Chucky, the soul of the killer.

38
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
It's scary if you chase a doll like that.

39
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
It's scary if you chase a doll like that.

40
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
It's scary if you chase a doll like that.

41
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
It's scary if you chase a doll like that.

42
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Let's play the doll.

43
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
It's scary.

44
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
It's scary.

45
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
It's scary.

46
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I don't know what will happen.

47
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
It's scary.

48
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
It's scary.

49
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Yamazaki.

50
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Yes.

51
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
No.

52
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
It's a doll.

53
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
If you don't chase it...

54
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Please stop in the middle.

55
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Please stop in the middle.

56
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Is it from now on?

57
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
It's getting scarier from now on.

58
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Sorry.

59
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Sorry.

60
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I'll do it again.

61
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Sorry.

62
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I'm sorry.

63
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
It's not getting scarier.

64
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
It's getting scarier from now on.

65
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
That's right.

66
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Okay.

67
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I'm Chucky.

68
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Kill you.

69
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Yes.

70
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
What?

71
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
What is it?

72
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
He took it back.

73
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
He took it back.

74
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
He must be tired.

75
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Yamazaki.

76
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Yamazaki.

77
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
It's different.

78
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
If you don't chase it properly, it won't be a doll.

79
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Please stop in the middle.

80
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
What?

81
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Please stop in the middle.

82
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Please stop in the middle.

83
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
You can't stop in the middle.

84
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
It's from now on.

85
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Really?

86
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Really?

87
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Chucky is a bad person.

88
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
It's scary, right?

89
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Yes.

90
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
If you're really scared,

91
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
say something like,

92
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
help me!

93
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
and run away.

94
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
My reaction may have been weak.

95
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Dan-san,

96
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I may think it's cool

97
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
to play a character

98
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
who stands in the way.

99
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
It's not like that.

100
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I don't think it's like that.

101
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
If you're scared, run away.

102
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
But I don't want to run away in this project.

103
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Sorry.

104
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Really.

105
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Let's do it again.

106
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Sorry.

107
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Let's do it again.

108
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Okay.

109
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Only this is good.

110
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Help me!

111
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Help me!

112
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Help me!

113
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I'm going crazy.

114
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
What?

115
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
What are you doing?

116
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
What?

117
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Help me!

118
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Help me!

119
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Help me!

120
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Wait! I'll catch you!

121
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
It's scary. Help me!

122
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Help me!

123
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
It's dangerous.

124
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Help you!

125
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Help me!

126
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
What's wrong with this?

127
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
You wrote it again.

128
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I'll kill you!

129
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
It's dangerous.

130
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Why?

131
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Kill me!

132
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I can't catch you, please!

133
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I can't!

134
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Yamazaki, don't break it.

135
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
This is good.

136
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Sorry.

137
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Yamazaki.

138
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Yamazaki.

139
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
How is it?

140
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I'm not scared at all.

141
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I'm not scared.

142
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I'm not scared!

143
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I'm not scared at all!

144
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
You too!

145
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I'm sorry.

146
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
If you're really scared, what would you do?

147
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I'd scream and run.

148
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
You bastard!

149
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Ask the staff to help you!

150
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
That might be true.

151
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I've been scared for four years.

152
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I'm sorry.

153
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Shall we take a break?

154
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Can we?

155
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
While I'm taking a break, I have something to tell you.

156
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
What is it?

157
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
It's about the future.

158
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
The future?

159
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
The story from the first episode of the 500th episode.

160
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
The story from the first episode of the 500th episode.

161
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
You can't decide on the 500th episode!

162
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I'm scared.

163
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
How is it?

164
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
The other day, everyone was tired because of the ski location.

165
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I felt bad, but Yamazaki said,

166
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
It's okay.

167
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
That's what happened, right?

168
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I made a good decision.

169
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
But I think there's something you can imagine.

170
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I think that's why you're so strong.

171
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I'm strong.

172
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I'm doing it properly.

173
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
He was like that.

174
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Let's watch it again.

175
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Let's do it.

176
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
There must be something.

177
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
It's like a house.

178
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Let's watch it again.

179
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
It's starting.

180
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
No way!

181
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I'm Jackie!

182
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I'm scared.

183
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Help me!

184
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I'm scared.

185
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I'm scared.

186
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Jackie!

187
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
It's coming!

188
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I'm scared.

189
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I'm going to cut the sub-time!

190
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Help me!

191
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
It's like middle school English.

192
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
It's dangerous!

193
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I'm scared.

194
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
It's coming!

195
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
It's coming!

196
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
It's coming!

197
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
What?

198
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
What?

199
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
What?

200
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
What?

201
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
What?

202
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I don't know.

203
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I don't know if it's going to come suddenly.

204
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
But it has a cute face.

205
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
It's back to normal.

206
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
It's true.

207
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
It's a doll.

208
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
It's so cold!

209
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,000
It was a little cold just now.

210
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
This way.

211
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
This way?

212
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Not yet.

213
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I'm watching it all the time.

214
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I think it's over.

215
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Is it over?

216
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
It's okay.

217
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
It's okay, isn't it?

218
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
It's okay.

219
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
It's over!

220
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
It's over!

221
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
What are you looking at?

222
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
You can't save it.

223
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Yes.

224
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Yes.

225
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I think no one will be caught.

226
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I don't want to do this, but...

227
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
It's not like I'm caught.

228
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I can't finish it.

229
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Can I ask you one more time?

230
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Yes.

231
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Will you be caught?

232
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Or will you only talk?

233
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Then...

234
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
The one who is caught...

235
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
You want to get 30% of it, don't you?

236
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I want to get it.

237
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I don't want to talk.

238
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
It's okay.

239
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
What should I do?

240
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Kill you!

241
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Hurry up!

242
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
It's coming!

243
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
It hurts!

244
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Kill you!

245
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
It's coming!

246
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:15,000
It's coming!

247
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
What?

248
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
It's over.

249
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
What?

250
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
It's over.

251
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
It's over?

252
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
It's over?

253
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Hold on.

254
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Dan-dan...

255
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I'm going to talk for a long time today.

256
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
What did you eat last time?

257
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,000
This morning.

258
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Senpai-chan, baby-chan...

259
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
You're so cute!

260
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
You are so cute.

261
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Why are you?

262
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Peek-a-boo, baby.

263
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Fuwa hawa

264
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
It's hard to come out

265
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
What's the matter?

266
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Thank you very much for coming to Kamui today

267
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Go home

268
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Yes

269
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Thank you very much

270
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I don't feel good

271
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Well, it's okay to have such a day

272
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
You can laugh

273
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
So really go home

274
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I came out and was told to go home in a few seconds

275
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
It's kind of a legend

276
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
How is it? Is it bad?

277
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
It's not good

278
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
It's not good

279
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Well, that's it

280
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Is there really something?

281
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
What is it?

282
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Wada Akiko almost died

283
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I almost died

284
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
The conversation on the newspaper was interesting

285
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Why was it on the newspaper?

286
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
The person who reported the accident or found it

287
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I thought it was an old man

288
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I thought it was an old man

289
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
And you didn't wear a skirt

290
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I didn't

291
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I saw a girl with a manly personality

292
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I thought it was a girl Wada Akiko

293
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
That's a strange story

294
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I told you

295
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
A girl Wada Akiko is Wada Akiko

296
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
It must have hurt

297
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
No matter how many times

298
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
No matter how many times

299
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I think the poison came out of her teeth

300
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
What are you talking about?

301
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Where does the poison come from?

302
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
It must have been really amazing

303
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Thank you

304
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I had an interesting dream the other day

305
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
A dream?

306
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
When I woke up, I laughed

307
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Don't laugh like that

308
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
It was a very interesting dream

309
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I want you to do a dream fortune teller

310
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I'm walking around the shopping mall alone

311
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I decided to go to the ramen shop

312
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I decided to go to the ramen shop in front of the shopping mall

313
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Alone?

314
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Alone

315
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
For some reason, I was running out of breath

316
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I took off all my clothes

317
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I ran to the ramen shop

318
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
When I ran, the ramen shop was in a long line

319
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
There were so many people lined up

320
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I thought I'd stop eating

321
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I ran in front of the line

322
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I ran in front of the line

323
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
If I was naked, I wouldn't eat ramen

324
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
It's weird to be naked

325
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I thought I'd put on my underwear

326
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I went into the alley of the shopping mall

327
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I was going to put on my underwear

328
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
It was a white brief

329
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
It was wet

330
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Was it wet?

331
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
It was wet

332
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I thought it was okay

333
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I put on my underwear

334
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:41,000
The brief was so small

335
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I couldn't put my fingers on it

336
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I panicked

337
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Why did you put on your underwear?

338
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
It was weird

339
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
It was wet

340
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
It was weird

341
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I thought I had to put on my underwear

342
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
A kid came out and said

343
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I'm wearing my underwear right now, what are you looking at?

344
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I woke up

345
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I woke up in a great place

346
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
What was it?

347
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
A dream fortune teller

348
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
That's right

349
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I want you to do it

350
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
There are times when I want to eat something

351
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
There may be

352
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
The dream I saw a long time ago was interesting

353
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
A dream where you can go to the pool and take a picture

354
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
You can take a picture

355
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I tried to put on my underwear

356
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
But it fell off again

357
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
If you look at this side

358
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
It's a punishment

359
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I don't know why it's a punishment

360
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I don't know

361
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
It's like putting on glue

362
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
It's here

363
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
It's a punishment

364
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I'll get it once

365
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
But if I take a shower again

366
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
It will fall off

367
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
It's funny

368
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Thank you

369
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
That's right

370
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Please stand up

371
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Are you okay?

372
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Why is there a round ring on the cow's nose?

373
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Please tell me

374
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
What do you think?

375
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
But that's

376
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
You take it with you

377
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
You pull it

378
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
That's why you put it on

379
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
That's not true

380
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I saw a scene of a cow giving birth in a farm

381
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Will it come out with a ring?

382
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I don't think so

383
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I put it on when I'm breastfeeding

384
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I don't care if you put it on

385
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Why is it coming out with a ring?

386
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I've been wearing it for a long time

387
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I'm sorry

388
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I'm going to continue this story

389
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I got it

390
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
That's right

391
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Why do you think it's a ring?

392
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,000
It's a round ring

393
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Why do you think it's a ring?

394
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
You can only see half

395
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
But that's all

396
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
You can't see it

397
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
You can see it

398
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
That's not true

399
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
It's not like this

400
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
It's like this

401
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I don't know if it's stuck

402
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
But if you just put it in

403
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
You pull it

404
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
That's scary

405
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
That's not true

406
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Why?

407
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,000
It's like a hairpin

408
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,000
If you put it in, it will come out

409
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,000
You have to bend it

410
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I've never seen a cow like that

411
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
You have to bend it

412
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
That's the black part

413
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
What?

414
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:12,000
If it comes out white, you have to put it in again

415
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
If it comes out black, it's black

416
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Why do you have to put it in for so long?

417
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
That's not true

418
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
That's not what I'm saying

419
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
It's a ring

420
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I wanted to say that it might be

421
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
You can't see what you see

422
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
But if you go near the cow

423
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,000
You can't see it

424
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I'll ask you

425
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
How far are you going to go near the cow?

426
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
You can't see it

427
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
It's not close to the cow

428
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
But you can see the nose

429
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
You can't do that

430
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
You can't do that

431
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
You can't do that

432
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
You can't do that

433
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
How far have you gone near the cow?

434
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I've gone really far

435
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Imagine that I'm really close to the cow

436
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
I'm closer than that

437
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,000
It's usually around here

438
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
It's usually around here

439
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
How far have you gone?

440
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I've gone really far

441
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Really?

442
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
You've gone really far

443
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
You've seen it here

444
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
It's a ring

445
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I don't like you that much

446
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
That's why I'm telling you

447
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
You've been with me for a long time

448
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I've been with you for a long time

449
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
But that's different

450
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Everyone knows that

451
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Everyone knows it's a ring

452
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
It's a ring

453
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
When I saw it up close it was a ring

454
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
But it's a ring

455
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Don't say it's a ring

456
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I'm really angry that it's a ring

457
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Today I'm going to do it all

458
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
What are you going to do?

459
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I'm going to take off my underwear

460
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I'm going to take off everyone's underwear

461
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
I've decided

462
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I'm going to take off everyone's underwear

463
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I'm going to put it in the mouth of the person next to me

464
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:17,000
What's so fun about just floating in the sea all day?

465
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I know

466
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I really know

467
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
You know how it feels?

468
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I know

469
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
For example, last week you skied

470
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Yes

471
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Was it fun?

472
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
For someone who can't skid, it's not that fun

473
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
It's not

474
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
It's the same for everyone

475
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
But for a sport you've never done before

476
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
What's so fun about it?

477
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I think so too

478
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
If you do it a few times

479
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
If you do it once a day

480
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
You'll gradually understand that it's fun

481
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
When it comes to wakame

482
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
When you really become wakame

483
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
You'll understand how fun it is

484
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,000
I'm going to get the right clothes for that

485
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
For that

486
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I'm going to get the right clothes for that

487
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
No, no, no

488
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
What kind of clothes are you going to get for that?

489
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I'm going to get clothes that are easier to do in the sea

490
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
I'm going to get clothes that are easier to do in the sea

491
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
It's hard to get

492
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
If you don't try it

493
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
You'll understand that

494
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Right?

495
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
If you look at it from the outside

496
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,000
You'll think it's not fun

497
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
That's why next week

498
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
You're going to be wakame for the opening

499
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Why?

500
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
I'm going to put my foot in between Iwa and Iwa

501
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
No, no, no

502
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
In about two and a half months

503
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
It's going to get more and more fun

504
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
That's not fun

505
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
No

506
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
I don't want to be wakame

507
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
I don't want to understand the feeling of wakame

508
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
I'm talking about skewers and jet skis

509
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
It's a sport that's as fun as wakame

510
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
It's really fun

511
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I'm sorry

512
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Earlier

513
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I understand

514
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
I'm having a lot of fun going down Yudofu

515
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I don't understand what you're saying

516
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Going down Yudofu

517
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
We've been talking about going down Yudofu

518
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
It's fun going down Yudofu from a place where there's nothing

519
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Matsumoto-san

520
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I heard that you can sing with the most interesting expression in the world

521
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Please show us

522
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
It's okay

523
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
It's a laugh

524
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Really?

525
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
I'll laugh because I'm bad at it

526
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Please

527
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
For example, you try it

528
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
It's terrible

529
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
It's a joke

530
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
You can't earn money with that

531
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
I'm sorry

532
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I've been to Europe or something

533
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Sensei, I'll leave it to you

534
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Really?

535
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
For the people who come here

536
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Wait a minute, why are you crying?

537
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Why are you crying?

538
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
I just didn't like this feeling

539
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Please

540
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
I'll really do it

541
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Wait a minute

542
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:45,000
When you sing with an interesting expression, you have to move like that

543
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
It's okay if you don't have it

544
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
But I want to rely on you

545
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Really?

546
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,000
It's okay, I don't need this

547
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Like a firefly

548
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Huh?

549
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Huh?

550
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Huh?

551
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Huh?

552
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Huh?

553
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
You know

554
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:27,000
It's okay if you can't laugh like that

555
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Wait a minute

556
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
It's fast

557
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Don't look at me

558
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
I'm not a guest

559
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
I can see your eyes

560
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Can I come out?

561
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
You can come out, but it depends on how you move your body

562
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,000
That's right, I've been doing this for 18 years

563
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Huh?

564
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
I'm just looking at you

565
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:10,000
I'm looking at you with white eyes, so I don't even know that you're coming
