1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Even today, a storm rages.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Help me!

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Help me!

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Help me!

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Help me!

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Stop!

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Stop it!

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Help me!

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I can't go any further!

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Help me!

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Help me!

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Help me!

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Help me!

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I want to be a fish!

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I want to be a fish!

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I want to be a fish!

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm so scared.

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'm so scared.

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Hey, shake it.

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I'm so scared.

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm so scared.

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
What are you doing?

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Shoot faster.

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm so scared.

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I'm so scared.

26
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm so scared.

27
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
You were great.

28
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I'm so scared.

29
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
How are you scared?

30
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I'm so scared.

31
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I don't know.

32
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I'm so scared.

33
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I'm so scared.

34
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I'm so scared.

35
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Throw it Osomatsu.

36
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Throw it.

37
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I'm so scared.

38
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I'm so scared.

39
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
What are you doing?

40
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:33,000
What are you doing?

41
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
What are you doing?

42
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,240
Save me!

43
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,280
Oh, Collection.

44
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,600
ook Reporter

45
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,160
rain

46
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:50,940
That's right

47
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,700
game

48
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:52,240
Oh

49
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,980
Tsu

50
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:56,500
Bon

51
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:04,140
독

52
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,160
Tokto

53
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,160
Takano

54
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:39,160
There is nothing to pick up in the forest.

55
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:55,160
This program is brought to you by the following sponsors.

56
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:15,160
Hey!

57
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:20,160
Hey!

58
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,160
Hey!

59
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,160
You're not a butterfly!

60
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,160
You guys say, hey!

61
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,160
Say it!

62
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,160
Today, I think I should say this.

63
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,160
There are many people who spread rumors.

64
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,160
What?

65
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:41,160
For example, the fact that I'm gay is obvious.

66
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,160
It's obvious?

67
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,160
What's good about it?

68
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,160
Your behavior is bad, isn't it?

69
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,160
No, no.

70
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,160
What do you mean by behavior?

71
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,160
You say, hey!

72
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,160
No one does that.

73
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,160
Say it!

74
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,160
Why?

75
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,160
You say, hey!

76
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,160
That's not good.

77
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:07,160
The reason why I'm angry is because I'm doing drugs right now.

78
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:10,160
That happens to both of you, doesn't it?

79
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:15,160
I get angry and when I watch TV, I can see it.

80
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:20,160
I can't calm down.

81
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,160
That's possible.

82
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:25,160
When I hear that, I get angry.

83
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,160
Look!

84
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:32,160
I can't show it to you.

85
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,160
I'm not that proud.

86
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,160
Hey!

87
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:40,160
I'm not proud.

88
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,160
So...

89
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:44,160
Don't say that!

90
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,160
I was told that on your show.

91
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,160
Yes, you were told that too.

92
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,160
I don't care.

93
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,160
My manager said,

94
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,160
Osaka people don't say that.

95
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,160
Tokyo people don't say that.

96
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,160
That's terrible.

97
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:58,160
Osaka people have been watching us for a long time.

98
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,160
They went to drink and said,

99
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:06,160
Hama-chan, you have a mole on your face.

100
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,160
You have a mole on your face.

101
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:12,160
I'm sure I don't have a mole on my face.

102
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,160
You don't know.

103
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,160
I have a little.

104
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,160
You have a little.

105
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,160
I don't have a mole on my face.

106
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,160
You have a little.

107
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:25,160
I've been doing this.

108
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,160
I've been making a super powerful joke.

109
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,160
You are using the power of medicine.

110
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:32,160
You don't know why I'm doing this.

111
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,160
You don't know.

112
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,160
When I'm talking,

113
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:39,160
Hey!

114
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,160
Say that!

115
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,160
Hey!

116
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:45,160
What is it?

117
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:50,160
I have a little mole on my face.

118
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,160
That's a insult.

119
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:57,160
If you say that, it's an insult.

120
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:00,160
No, no!

121
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,160
I'm not going to say that.

122
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,160
I'm doing it because I'm going to say that.

123
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:10,160
I can accept this kind of thing easily.

124
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,160
I don't know if it's true.

125
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,160
If I say I'm an angel,

126
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,160
I can't believe it.

127
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,160
That's why I'm saying that.

128
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,160
I'm an angel.

129
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,160
I can't say that.

130
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,160
I can't say that.

131
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,160
I have a lot of real stories.

132
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,160
I have a story like Kappa.

133
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,160
It's a real story.

134
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,160
I can't believe it.

135
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,160
I can't believe it.

136
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,160
Where did you see it?

137
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:38,160
I saw it in the bathroom of my house.

138
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,160
Kappa in the bathroom.

139
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:44,160
It's not fresh yet.

140
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,160
Do you understand?

141
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,160
It's a cold hand.

142
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:51,160
It's coming out.

143
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:54,160
Don't say that.

144
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,160
I don't know what to say.

145
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,160
What are you?

146
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,160
Let me say it with a face like a mountain man.

147
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,160
I really look like a mountain man.

148
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,160
A mountain man doesn't look like this.

149
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,160
It's true.

150
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,160
This is true.

151
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,160
I can't believe it.

152
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,160
I'm rude to Kappa.

153
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,160
I don't know what to say.

154
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,160
It's not Kappa.

155
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,160
Don't force yourself.

156
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,160
I'm sorry, Kappa.

157
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,160
Kappa is different.

158
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:26,160
I'm sorry, Kappa.

159
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,160
It's true.

160
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,160
It's not Kappa.

161
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,160
It's really coming out.

162
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:34,160
Why are you falling down?

163
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:36,160
I fell down.

164
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,160
Where?

165
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:38,160
What?

166
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:40,160
Where did you fall?

167
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:42,160
I fell down.

168
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:44,160
Where did you fall?

169
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:46,160
I was in the bathroom.

170
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:50,160
I was in someone's ass.

171
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,160
It's true.

172
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,160
Stop it.

173
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,160
What?

174
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,160
Stop it.

175
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:58,160
It's a book.

176
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,160
This is a real story.

177
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,160
I'm scared.

178
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:05,160
My brother was studying in the book.

179
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:11,160
A dead old man said to my brother,

180
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:16,160
Takahiro.

181
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,160
That's obviously the old man's voice.

182
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,160
That's the old man's voice.

183
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:24,160
I don't know if that's true.

184
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,160
That's true.

185
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:32,160
You don't believe that the ancestors come back to the book.

186
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:38,160
It's like Gachapin.

187
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,160
I was watching it the other day.

188
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,160
Let's go to the uninhabited island.

189
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,160
An animal came out.

190
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,160
It's an animal I've never seen before.

191
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,160
Gachapin.

192
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,160
That's right.

193
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,160
Muku.

194
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:54,160
You guys.

195
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,160
That's right.

196
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,160
What were we talking about?

197
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,160
Do you believe it?

198
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,160
Do you believe it?

199
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,160
The ancestors come back.

200
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,160
The ancestors.

201
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,160
I don't think so.

202
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,160
That's when we're dumb.

203
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:12,160
I don't think I've seen anything like that before.

204
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,160
To someone?

205
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,160
To someone.

206
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,160
I can't do anything bad.

207
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:20,160
During that period.

208
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,160
I can't do it if I want to.

209
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,160
What do you want to do?

210
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:30,160
What are you talking about?

211
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:34,160
It's something that you can enjoy by yourself.

212
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,160
What do you mean by that?

213
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:43,160
If you think you're old and you're not sure what to do, you'll do it.

214
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:48,160
A jigsaw puzzle?

215
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,160
You're really tired.

216
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:55,160
I'm tired from work. I'm all alone.

217
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,160
Bring me to a place where you're tired.

218
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:59,160
I'm all alone.

219
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,160
I'm back.

220
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,160
I'm tired.

221
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,160
I'm tired.

222
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,160
I'm all alone.

223
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,160
I'm all alone. What are you going to do?

224
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,160
Don't sleep!

225
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,160
That's true.

226
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,160
That's true.

227
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,160
Don't sleep.

228
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,160
That's true.

229
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,160
Wait a minute.

230
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,160
What is it?

231
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,160
Listen to me.

232
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,160
I'm tired.

233
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,160
I'm tired.

234
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,160
I'm tired.

235
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,160
What is it?

236
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,160
My lower body is...

237
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,160
It's hot.

238
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,160
It's hot. What are you going to do?

239
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,160
What are you going to do?

240
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,160
I'm all alone.

241
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:33,160
Don't take it off!

242
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:36,160
It's hot.

243
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,160
That's enough.

244
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,160
Take it off.

245
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,160
Take it off.

246
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,160
Take it off.

247
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,160
I'm all alone.

248
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,160
Take it off.

249
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,160
Take it off.

250
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,160
Take it off.

251
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,160
Take it off.

252
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,160
Hey, come here.

253
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,160
This is Mr. Kaoru.

254
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,160
He's 20 years old.

255
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,160
He's currently on the Omron racing team.

256
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,160
He's a circuit lady.

257
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,160
Did you go to the race?

258
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,160
Yes.

259
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,160
Did you run?

260
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,160
No, I went to F3000.

261
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,160
Oh, that one.

262
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,160
Yes.

263
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,160
Do you have a favorite racer?

264
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,160
A racer from Omron.

265
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,160
Who?

266
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,160
Mr. Jan Lammers.

267
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,160
What?

268
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,160
Mr. Jan Lammers.

269
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:14,160
It's like Mr. Jan Luke Pancham.

270
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:20,160
Thank you very much.

271
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,160
Everyone has long legs.

272
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,160
Let me introduce you.

273
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,160
How to get home.

274
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,160
We've always thought about how to get home.

275
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,160
From a different point of view.

276
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,160
Oh, really?

277
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:36,160
I don't have a name for it.

278
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:41,160
You smoke a cigarette and spit it out.

279
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:44,160
You're making me go home.

280
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,160
We're here.

281
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,160
I can't get out of here.

282
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,160
That's right.

283
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:53,160
We're looking at things from a different point of view.

284
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,160
That's right.

285
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,160
We don't have to go home.

286
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,160
The customers can go home.

287
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,160
Oh, really?

288
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,160
That's good.

289
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:02,160
I think this is a good idea.

290
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,160
Let's try it.

291
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:05,160
Can I try it?

292
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,160
The customer was good today.

293
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:09,160
They didn't do it.

294
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:12,160
Then I'd like to introduce you to the postcards.

295
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,160
Why do you always put a tie in your pants?

296
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,160
Don't you hate it?

297
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,160
Do you think it's cool?

298
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:26,160
But does the world see it that way, Matsumoto?

299
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,160
I'm not responsible.

300
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,160
Hamada, what do you think?

301
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,160
What's wrong with you?

302
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,160
Don't show me.

303
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:38,160
I think I'll have to talk about this someday.

304
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:43,160
When the time comes, I'll have to talk about it.

305
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,160
I'm definitely going to do this.

306
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:47,160
Why?

307
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:52,160
It's just a policy.

308
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:56,160
I want to tie it in a narrow place.

309
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,160
I understand that.

310
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:00,160
I want to tie it as narrow as possible.

311
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,160
I don't like it thick.

312
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:06,160
It's going to be a little long.

313
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,160
That's right.

314
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:09,160
You can take it out.

315
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,160
You can take it out.

316
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:19,160
What do you call it?

317
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,160
This?

318
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,160
No, it's not.

319
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:25,160
It's better to cut it.

320
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:28,160
So, look.

321
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:34,160
No one can keep up with this year.

322
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:37,160
No, it's not like this.

323
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:41,160
I'll tell you a serious story.

324
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:48,160
If it's like this, your eyes look longer.

325
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,160
It's an illusion of the eyes.

326
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,160
If you do this, your eyes look longer.

327
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,160
This is the long part.

328
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:58,160
No, it's not like that.

329
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,160
It's an illusion of the human eye.

330
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:06,160
So, if you put it like this,

331
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:11,160
It's from 18-year-old Mr. Kaoru of Kannan Kibo.

332
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:14,160
The pen name is Hamada Nisei.

333
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,160
It's a story from a long time ago.

334
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,160
Thank you.

335
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,160
When I got on the train home from school,

336
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:23,160
When I got on the train home from school,

337
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,160
An old man got on and I just looked at his face for a moment.

338
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:27,160
I didn't know at that time.

339
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:30,160
When I looked at him closely, he was an old man.

340
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,160
He was wearing a skirt.

341
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,160
He was wearing a beret.

342
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,160
He was holding a bag from his shoulder.

343
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:39,160
He was wearing high heels.

344
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,160
I was surprised by that.

345
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:44,160
He was talking to two foreigners on the same train.

346
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,160
And it seemed like they were talking to each other.

347
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,160
I was surprised.

348
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:50,160
Have you ever met such a strange person?

349
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:53,160
There is such a strange person.

350
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,160
What is that?

351
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,160
Isn't that a woman?

352
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,160
I think so.

353
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,160
His face is like an old man.

354
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,160
He was wearing a skirt.

355
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,160
And he spoke English.

356
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,160
He is cool.

357
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,160
He is cool.

358
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,160
He is cool.

359
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,160
He is handsome.

360
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,160
He is handsome.

361
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,160
In that sense.

362
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,160
In that sense.

363
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:13,160
There are many such people.

364
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:17,160
Have you ever seen such a strange person?

365
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:21,160
He is wearing strange clothes.

366
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:26,160
He was talking to a vending machine at a station.

367
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:29,160
He was saying, give me 10 yen.

368
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,160
This is my brother.

369
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:33,160
Give me 10 yen.

370
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,160
That's right.

371
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,160
He was saying, brother, give me 10 yen.

372
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,160
There was such a woman.

373
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,160
Oh.

374
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:42,160
It happened in the underground of Umeda.

375
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,160
That's right.

376
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,160
Give me 10 yen.

377
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,160
Yeah.

378
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:48,160
When I told him no, he said, give me 100 yen.

379
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,160
Why did you say that?

380
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:51,160
Why?

381
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:53,160
Give me 10 yen.

382
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:57,160
Minari is doing it properly.

383
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:02,160
I don't know if this will be used in the broadcast.

384
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:06,160
In the past, there was a person like that.

385
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,160
He was sleeping at the station.

386
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,160
He saved my life.

387
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,160
In the underground of Umeda?

388
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,160
In the underground of Umeda.

389
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:17,160
There is a Koshien stadium, right?

390
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,160
There is an idol baseball tournament there.

391
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:21,160
About once a year.

392
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,160
Johnny's.

393
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:26,160
We were working.

394
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,160
We were working.

395
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,160
There is a place called Umeda month.

396
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:32,160
I was in a hurry to go through the underground of Umeda.

397
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,160
Because I couldn't make it in time.

398
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,160
The flow of Koshien stadium.

399
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,160
That Gya Gya Gya Gya.

400
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,160
Middle school students and high school students.

401
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,160
Because it is a half train.

402
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,160
I went out to Umeda.

403
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,160
I fell in love with the underground of Umeda.

404
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,160
I was in a hurry.

405
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,160
I saw it.

406
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,160
I don't like it.

407
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,160
I was like this.

408
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,160
I was like this.

409
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,160
I ran away.

410
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:02,160
I was caught.

411
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:06,160
That was amazing.

412
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,160
I fell in love.

413
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,160
I fell in love.

414
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,160
I couldn't stand it.

415
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,160
From above.

416
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:16,160
I was riding.

417
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,160
I couldn't breathe.

418
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,160
I was in a hurry.

419
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,160
I was about to be pushed.

420
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,160
At that time.

421
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,160
I was sleeping at the station.

422
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,160
The man was shining.

423
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,160
I dug a cardboard box.

424
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,160
I dug it.

425
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,160
No.

426
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,160
I can't do that.

427
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,160
No.

428
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:36,160
I was holding this.

429
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,160
It was dirty.

430
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:40,160
I dug it.

431
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,160
It was so beautiful.

432
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,160
There was a flower path.

433
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,160
There was a flower path.

434
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,160
I was holding it like this.

435
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,160
I was holding it like this.

436
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:54,160
It's true.

437
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,160
I wanted to thank him.

438
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,160
But he wasn't there.

439
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,160
He is cool.

440
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,160
He is a man.

441
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,160
He didn't tell me his name.

442
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:05,160
He only told me cardboard box.

443
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:08,160
He didn't say cardboard box.

444
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,160
It's true.

445
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,160
It's true.

446
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,160
It's true.

447
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:16,160
It was so beautiful.

448
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,160
That's all.

449
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,160
Shall we go home?

450
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:21,160
Let's go home.

451
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:26,160
Let's go home.

452
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,160
Let's go home.

453
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,160
Goodbye.

454
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,160
Goodbye.

455
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,160
Goodbye.

456
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,160
One.

457
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,160
Two.

458
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,160
Three.

459
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:03,160
Hello.

460
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:09,160
I have a nice present for you.

461
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,160
Really?

462
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,160
Yes.

463
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,160
Look at this.

464
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:17,160
I made something like this on my show.

465
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,160
What is it?

466
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:22,160
This is famous in the streets.

467
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,160
Really?

468
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:26,160
It's a power man No.2.

469
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:29,160
I made this panel.

470
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:32,160
I want to give it to you on TV.

471
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,160
It's from our mouth.

472
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,160
Really?

473
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:38,160
I want you to take it from our mouth.

474
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:43,160
Here you are.

475
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:49,160
The youngest one.

476
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:53,160
Where did it come from?

477
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:57,160
It's from Mr. Kitaizo's mouth.

478
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:02,160
Please take it from our mouth.

479
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:06,160
This is a photo of this panel.

480
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:11,160
This is a power man No.2.

481
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:14,160
If you want a photo of this panel,

482
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:18,160
it's on the bottom of the screen.

483
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:23,160
Please send it to us.

484
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,160
That's the kind of person he is.

485
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,160
Really?

486
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:29,160
I want you to come and take it.

487
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,160
Thank you.

488
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,160
I'm waiting for you.

489
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,160
I'm waiting for you.

490
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:38,160
I'm waiting for you.

491
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:41,160
I'm waiting for you.

492
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,160
Sign it.

493
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:46,160
I'm signing it as always.

494
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:51,160
I'm waiting for you.

495
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:58,160
The person is signing it in front of me.

496
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:02,160
I'm waiting for you.

497
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,160
There are a lot of lies about the fire.

498
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,160
That's right.

499
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:10,160
What if it didn't happen?

500
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,160
What would you do if it didn't happen?

501
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:16,160
So, while you're waiting for the fire,

502
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:20,160
you can put it on the desk of the maid.

503
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,160
The maid?

504
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,160
Yes.

505
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:24,160
What would you do if it didn't happen?

506
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:26,160
What would you do if it didn't happen?

507
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,160
What would you do?

508
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:30,160
If it didn't happen,

509
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:33,160
you can put it on the desk of the maid.

510
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,160
That's good.

511
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:37,160
That's a good warning.

512
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,160
By the way,

513
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:40,160
I can't use you for the next time.

514
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:43,160
Bye.

515
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:46,160
I'm really waiting for you.

516
00:22:46,160 --> 00:23:02,160
Start.

517
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:05,160
It's really hot.

518
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:15,160
Yamanagi, stand here.

519
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:20,160
Fried butter, fried butter.

520
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:23,160
It's hot.

521
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:43,160
