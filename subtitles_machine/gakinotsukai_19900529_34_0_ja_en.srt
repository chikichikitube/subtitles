00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Good evening, everyone. This is the first episode of the Chikichikyousero Meijin battle at the Gaki no Tsukaiya Ara.

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Let's welcome the two Meijin.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Hamada Meijin.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Matsumoto Meijin.

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Please roll the dice to decide who goes first.

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Please roll the dice.

7
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Hey! That's too early!

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
That's too early!

9
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Matsumoto Meijin has 10 seconds left.

10
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
That's too early.

11
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Gono-san.

12
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
What's that?

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
It's black.

14
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
What's this?

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
It's a water ball.

16
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
A black water ball?

17
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Yes.

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:52,000
This program is brought to you by Sunluck and the following sponsors.

19
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Tokuno-san.

20
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Painless.

21
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
What's that?

22
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
You're pretty strong.

23
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I can't see you.

24
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Thank you very much.

25
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Thank you very much.

26
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Seven, five.

27
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
It's a love piece.

28
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
A love piece?

29
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
You call this a love piece?

30
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Eight, five.

31
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
It's white.

32
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Meijin.

33
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
What's this?

34
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Huh?

35
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
What are these five lines from this corner?

36
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,000
What is it?

37
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
It's chance time.

38
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Don't do that.

39
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Are you going to lose?

40
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I'll calm down after death.

41
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
This is the only one.

42
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Two, one, white.

43
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
It's my win if I lose.

44
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Is that so?

45
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Yes.

46
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I didn't know that.

47
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Meijin is doing it.

48
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I didn't know that.

49
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
What is it?

50
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
What is it?

51
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
What is it?

52
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Five lines.

53
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Thank you very much.

54
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I don't want to come to such a far place.

55
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
This is the second time.

56
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
That's right.

57
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Let's go somewhere closer.

58
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
That's right.

59
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
You don't have to come to such a far place.

60
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I can't do it in the neighborhood.

61
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
You can't do it in the neighborhood.

62
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Whose convenience is this?

63
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Whose convenience is this?

64
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
It's all over the place.

65
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
That's right.

66
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
We went to Yokohama.

67
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Where did we go the other day?

68
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
We went to a very far place.

69
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
That's right.

70
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
This is the neighborhood, right?

71
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
That's right.

72
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Everyone.

73
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Is this a neighborhood?

74
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
That's not it.

75
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Yokohama?

76
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Where is Yokohama?

77
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
It's the same.

78
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I'm from Hamako too.

79
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
You're lying.

80
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Hamako Yagana.

81
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
It's sticky.

82
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Hamako Yagana.

83
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
That girl.

84
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
It's like a cartoon.

85
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I'm sorry from the opening.

86
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
What?

87
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Everyone, look at it today.

88
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
There's something that's changed, right?

89
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
What's changed?

90
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
That's right.

91
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
You understood.

92
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I thought no one would notice.

93
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
That's true.

94
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
This is what changed.

95
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
This is.

96
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
That's true.

97
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
It changed.

98
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
It's been the same all the time.

99
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
The set has finally changed.

100
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
That's right.

101
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Speaking of which.

102
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
The previous set was just like this.

103
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
This set is just like this.

104
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
It's the same as the previous set.

105
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
It's true.

106
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
It's true.

107
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I didn't dare say this.

108
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I've seen the previous set.

109
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
This set?

110
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
That's right.

111
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
It's not funny.

112
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
It's not funny.

113
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
This is the only set in this program.

114
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I bought that shiny one.

115
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
It's a bugi-ugi band.

116
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
You're lying.

117
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
It's true.

118
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Did you still have it after this?

119
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I had it.

120
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
It's a bugi-ugi band.

121
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
It's true.

122
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
It's true.

123
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
It's true.

124
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
It's true.

125
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I'm telling you.

126
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I didn't spend any money on this program.

127
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,500
We didn't spend any money.

128
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,000
LIkely.

129
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
You only spent money on renting the venue.

130
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
You must know such a thing.

131
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
ON SHOCK hoy...

132
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
It's cheap to write the name of regional manager in enthalpy.

133
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
It's...

134
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
It must be expensive like IOMA's name.

135
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
The show behind us.

136
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
They stole the money from the wallet that the chairman lost.

137
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
It's true.

138
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Really.

139
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
It's pocket money.

140
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
It's not just pocket money, it's money that we slow down like we sucked.

141
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Hey.

142
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
What should I talk about today?

143
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Shall we talk about that?

144
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:45,500
What do you want to talk about?

145
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:48,500
What kind of story do you want to hear from me?

146
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,500
I want to hear everything about you.

147
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,500
Why? There must be something you want to hear.

148
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,500
If the audience wants to hear this, that's for sure.

149
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,500
But I don't want to hear anything about you.

150
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:01,500
Everyone who came here is the same.

151
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,500
Is that so?

152
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:05,500
Even when they told me not to take off my underwear, I took it off.

153
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,500
Yeah.

154
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,500
Right?

155
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,500
Yeah, but you know...

156
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:12,500
I remembered that I had to get used to Tokyo a little more.

157
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,500
You did?

158
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

159
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,500
Why did you remember that?

160
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:18,500
Osaka is already dead.

161
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:22,500
The other day, I thought I'd play in Osaka for the first time in a while.

162
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,500
But there was no one there.

163
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,500
That's just a coincidence, right?

164
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,500
No, I'm sure you don't know.

165
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:32,500
So you're hiding in a store somewhere?

166
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:33,500
No, I'm not hiding in a store.

167
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,500
Hey, Matsumoto is here.

168
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:38,500
I was wondering if you'd come if you got caught.

169
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,500
I'm not hiding in a store.

170
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,500
I went to 10K85.

171
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:45,500
Don't go to 10K after looking for a woman.

172
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,500
Show me the store.

173
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,500
I can't tell you the name of the bridge, but it's a crane car.

174
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,500
10K is...

175
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,500
It goes like this.

176
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,500
It goes like this.

177
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,500
It goes like this.

178
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,500
No, it doesn't break.

179
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,500
Oh, really?

180
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:01,500
It used to be called a hook bridge on the bridge of Dotonbori.

181
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,500
There was a signboard like this.

182
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

183
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,500
There was a bridge and the river of Dotonbori was flowing.

184
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

185
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,500
It was called a hook bridge.

186
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,500
That's right.

187
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,500
There's no one there.

188
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,500
Oh, really?

189
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:21,500
When I was walking around, I saw a big marimo in the west.

190
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,500
It's quiet in front of the bridge.

191
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

192
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,500
I don't know.

193
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,500
There's a big marimo in the west.

194
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:31,500
The round grass is breaking up in the snow.

195
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,500
Run and then bang, bang, bang.

196
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,500
What was the situation like before?

197
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:39,500
Oh, I was surprised.

198
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:43,500
There's always a young man walking in the south.

199
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,500
Yeah.

200
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,500
The strike zone is here.

201
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,500
Yeah.

202
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,500
They were selling it.

203
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:50,500
Well, it was about 12 years ago.

204
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,500
You're lying.

205
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:54,500
It's been three years since I started shooting.

206
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,500
I started shooting in the strike zone.

207
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:59,500
Well, when the time is late, the strike zone is...

208
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,500
I think it's okay around here.

209
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

210
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,500
I think so, too.

211
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,500
It's getting worse.

212
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,500
Well, it's already sold out at this time.

213
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

214
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:09,500
There wasn't even that.

215
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:14,500
I was walking with three men, but at 5 o'clock in the morning, I couldn't even find a broken ball.

216
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,500
That's not good.

217
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:19,500
I thought I'd pull it out with a broken ball, but I couldn't find it.

218
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,500
There was no one to use it.

219
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,500
Because there was no one.

220
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:27,500
So where did your grumpy feelings go?

221
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:35,500
I have no choice but to go borrow adult videos that I've been doing until 5 o'clock.

222
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,500
It's empty, isn't it?

223
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:39,500
What are you guys doing? Don't pull adult videos.

224
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:42,500
I'll watch it.

225
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:45,500
What are you talking about?

226
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:46,500
Adult videos, too.

227
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,500
But Tokyo is a difficult place to borrow.

228
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,500
Oh, yeah?

229
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,500
Everyone's so tense.

230
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,500
Why is that?

231
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,500
Have you ever written it here?

232
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,500
I have.

233
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,500
Isn't it weird? Osaka is more like this.

234
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,500
It's like, yeah, it's bad.

235
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,500
You can say that.

236
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:06,500
No, it's like this guy is pretending not to see anything.

237
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:09,500
I'm sure he'll come back and hit me later.

238
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,500
It's kind of like this.

239
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,500
I don't want him to come back.

240
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,500
No, I don't get that kind of rain.

241
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:18,500
I went to the store, and my brother was a college student.

242
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,500
Yeah.

243
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,500
I went to the store and said, yeah.

244
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,500
Yeah.

245
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,500
Yeah.

246
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,500
I was wondering if there was anything nice.

247
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,500
Please come.

248
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,500
We went to the store together.

249
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,500
This is it.

250
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,500
Oh, yeah. In Tokyo?

251
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,500
That's right.

252
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,500
That's not true.

253
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,500
This is weird.

254
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,500
There's a place with a ranking.

255
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,500
It's called the best store of the week.

256
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,500
One on the shelf.

257
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,500
It's in the band.

258
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,500
Hey, is that true?

259
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,500
No, it's a lie.

260
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,500
That's the store manager's preference.

261
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:48,500
This is the truth.

262
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:52,500
I don't know why he said that.

263
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:57,500
Well, you know, I don't think he's as bad as people in Osaka.

264
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,500
That's not true.

265
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,500
Is that so?

266
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,500
That's the same for everyone.

267
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:06,500
Which man in Japan is the worst Osaka guy?

268
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:10,500
All of Osaka's alcohol is on rent.

269
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,500
Oh, is that so?

270
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,500
Tokyo is pretty much free to choose, right?

271
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,500
It's pretty much free to choose.

272
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,500
Isn't it?

273
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,500
That's true.

274
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,500
How many years have you been in Osaka?

275
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,500
It's not open at all.

276
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,500
Why is that?

277
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,500
Well, that's because I rent a lot.

278
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,500
One person.

279
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:29,500
You rent it for about five minutes a time, right?

280
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

281
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,500
No, that's not true.

282
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,500
You.

283
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,500
Damn it.

284
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:37,500
You rent it for five minutes and you can't finish it.

285
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,500
That's not true.

286
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:42,500
What is this?

287
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,500
I'm listening.

288
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,500
Idiot.

289
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,500
I'm listening.

290
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:50,500
No one is listening.

291
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,500
You.

292
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:54,500
I'm listening like this.

293
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,500
That's not true.

294
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,500
What is this?

295
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,500
What is this?

296
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,500
You can't say that.

297
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,500
You can't listen like this.

298
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,500
That's not true.

299
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:08,500
Even if you're a student, you're a sushi restaurant owner.

300
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:11,500
That's not true.

301
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,500
But that's true.

302
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:15,500
That's not true.

303
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:18,500
I usually rent it for about five minutes.

304
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:21,500
That's not true.

305
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:27,500
But it's a waste more than you've rented it, so don't you think you should do it for the time being?

306
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,500
Isn't that something to see?

307
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:34,500
Shut up.

308
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,500
Then what are you going to do with five minutes?

309
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,500
What?

310
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:40,500
What are you going to do with five minutes?

311
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,500
I looked at it and it was 45 minutes.

312
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,500
That's not true.

313
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,500
You should have written it in the first place.

314
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:50,500
It's difficult to go back when you've rented it for about five minutes.

315
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,500
What's difficult?

316
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,500
What's difficult?

317
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,500
I rented it for five minutes.

318
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:58,500
I have to return it in good health at that time.

319
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:02,500
If you go to a tired Kaose, you'll be like this.

320
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,500
I did something.

321
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,500
That's right.

322
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:08,500
You can't make a bear in front of you.

323
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:13,500
You have to return it in good health and say, thank you very much.

324
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,500
I've already rented it, but we're not that tired.

325
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,500
That's right.

326
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,500
We just saw it.

327
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,500
You have to return it in good health.

328
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,500
I don't rent movies that are completely different from dummy movies.

329
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,500
I often rent dummy movies.

330
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:28,500
If you rent three adult movies, you can rent one dummy movie.

331
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,500
Because it's normal.

332
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:35,500
There are many people who suddenly go to the adult corner.

333
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:38,500
That's right.

334
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:42,500
Even if it's a lie, I've seen a masterpiece once.

335
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:45,500
This is too obvious.

336
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,500
I know.

337
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,500
You came to the adult corner.

338
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:51,500
You don't have to say it.

339
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,500
What have you been doing recently?

340
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,500
What are you talking about?

341
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:58,500
I haven't been able to do anything recently.

342
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,500
You're lying.

343
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:03,500
Don't say anything.

344
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:08,500
You're more handsome than me.

345
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:12,500
I'm disappointed.

346
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,500
What are you talking about?

347
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:17,500
You don't have a rental video that you haven't seen in Minami.

348
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,500
I have a rental video.

349
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:23,500
You don't have an adult movie that you haven't seen.

350
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:26,500
You and I are cute.

351
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,500
I think I'm cuter.

352
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,500
What do you mean?

353
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:34,500
You often go to the adult corner.

354
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:38,500
That's you.

355
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,500
That's you.

356
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:45,500
Where did you get the money for the adult movie this year?

357
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:49,500
What are you doing?

358
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:55,500
I'm going to Osaka.

359
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,500
You're worse.

360
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,500
I've never been there.

361
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:06,500
When he was in junior high school, he asked me to go to the girls' room.

362
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,500
I refused.

363
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,500
Wait.

364
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:15,500
That's what we planned.

365
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,500
Why is it my fault?

366
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,500
Did I tell you what happened after that?

367
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,500
I'm angry.

368
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:26,500
I'm going to get hit.

369
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:32,500
When I went into the girl's room, there were a lot of shelves.

370
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:35,500
There were a lot of clothes.

371
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:41,500
There were two girls who took a nero.

372
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:44,500
They said, hey, hey, hey.

373
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:48,500
There was a bra, but there were no pants.

374
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,500
I said, what is this?

375
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:59,500
I went up the stairs and saw a fat woman.

376
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:03,500
I hated her.

377
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,500
I hated her.

378
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,500
I hated her.

379
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,500
I hated her.

380
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,500
I hated her.

381
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,500
I hated her.

382
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,500
I hated her.

383
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:22,500
When I got out of the room, there was a table tennis table on the right.

384
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:31,500
There was a lot of dust on the table.

385
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:35,500
I went under the table.

386
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,500
I went under the table.

387
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,500
I went under the table.

388
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:42,500
I went under the table.

389
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:47,500
As I went under the table, what did this girl do?

390
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:53,500
She took from that dirty shirt.

391
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:57,500
I thought, bring this.

392
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:05,500
When it is very hot in summer, who will bring this dusty woman?

393
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:08,500
This is a Mr. Hamada.

394
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:16,500
When you were in middle school, you went to see girls, didn't you?

395
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,500
That too!

396
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,500
When I was in elementary school

397
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:38,500
When I opened the window, there were about 50 or 60 girls. They called me Mr. Joe.

398
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:42,500
When I opened the window, there were about 50 or 60 girls. They called me Mr. Joe.

399
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,500
You look like Moroni!

400
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:47,500
Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

401
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,500
Mr. Joe was amazing!

402
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,500
Let's go to the post office.

403
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,500
Oh, hello.

404
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:02,500
Today, the general office came to see you.

405
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,500
They said you were preparing for the meeting in Inagawa.

406
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,500
What do you mean preparing?

407
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,500
Ms. Takada.

408
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:10,500
What is the contact place for you?

409
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:14,500
What is the contact place for you?

410
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,500
Is it a company?

411
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:18,500
You look like you are working for a big company.

412
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,500
Do you watch this program every week?

413
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,500
Yes.

414
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,500
Which one are you a fan of?

415
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,500
I like both of them.

416
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:28,500
Which one are you a fan of?

417
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,500
It's obvious.

418
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,500
I'm not popular.

419
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,500
Which one are you a fan of?

420
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:40,500
I'm not popular.

421
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:43,500
I'm not popular.

422
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:46,500
Thank you very much.

423
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,500
Please keep watching.

424
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:53,500
I'd like to introduce you to my brother.

425
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,500
Which one should I choose?

426
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,500
Please listen to my story.

427
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,500
When I was working part-time at KFC,

428
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:03,500
I was taking orders for a drive-thru.

429
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:08,500
Suddenly, my aunt came into the drive-thru with a bicycle instead of a car.

430
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,500
She said loudly,

431
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:13,500
Give me five KFCs.

432
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,500
I asked her again,

433
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:18,500
Is five KFCs okay?

434
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:19,500
She said,

435
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,500
No, five KFCs.

436
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,500
She said,

437
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,500
Five KFCs.

438
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:26,500
I came into the drive-thru with a bicycle

439
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,500
and asked her to give me five KFCs.

440
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,500
I couldn't stop laughing.

441
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,500
That's right.

442
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:36,500
I thought that's the name of the product.

443
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,500
That's right.

444
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:40,500
My aunt is really stupid.

445
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:44,500
I was talking to my friend the other day.

446
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:47,500
When I was a kid,

447
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,500
I went to my friend's house to play.

448
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,500
My aunt was angry.

449
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:58,500
My brother was more angry than my aunt.

450
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,500
What are you thinking?

451
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,500
She said,

452
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,500
Don't be angry.

453
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,500
My aunt was very angry.

454
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,500
She was very excited.

455
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:08,500
Don't be angry.

456
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,500
Bring me some butter.

457
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:15,500
Butter.

458
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:19,500
What do birds do?

459
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,500
What?

460
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,500
Birds.

461
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,500
Birds are very difficult.

462
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:25,500
Birds?

463
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:26,500
Birds.

464
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,500
I quit.

465
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,500
You quit?

466
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,500
I quit.

467
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,500
I quit.

468
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:32,500
I didn't want to be on TV.

469
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:36,500
I was told to fly from 10 meters above.

470
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:40,500
That's a plane you made, isn't it?

471
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,500
I wanted to quit.

472
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,500
So,

473
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,500
I said I would do it on TV.

474
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,500
I did it.

475
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,500
There are still many problems.

476
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,500
It's complicated.

477
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,500
So,

478
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,500
I said I would go to see it.

479
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,500
She said,

480
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:58,500
You did it very well.

481
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,500
You were very excited.

482
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:05,500
You didn't make a flying plane.

483
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,500
I was 10 meters above.

484
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,500
You said you would fly with your clothes on.

485
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,500
You were very excited.

486
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:15,500
You were very excited.

487
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:16,500
So,

488
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,500
staffs.

489
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:18,500
You were very excited.

490
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,500
Sorry.

491
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,500
Staffs said,

492
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,500
Stop it.

493
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:26,500
You should have flown while you were wearing it.

494
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,500
You should not have done that.

495
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:32,500
Three people from the start will ride it.

496
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:36,500
Order them to do that.

497
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,500
They were saying they wanted to fly with it.

498
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,500
Yes.

499
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:43,500
They said no.

500
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:44,500
Just let them fly.

501
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:47,500
It was about 15 meters.

502
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:52,500
Order them to do that out there.

503
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,500
There're a lot of cars going over there.

504
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,500
I didn't think Hamada would be there.

505
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,500
What about the old man?

506
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:00,500
The old man?

507
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:01,500
Yeah.

508
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,500
Gyoza, is he here?

509
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,500
Well, I think he's here.

510
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,500
I don't think he's going to send the old man.

511
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,500
I wonder if he sent the old man.

512
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:13,500
What are you going to do?

513
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,500
Are you going to do it?

514
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,500
Not really.

515
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,500
Then don't do it.

516
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,500
I don't think so.

517
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:24,500
I think there's no end to making more and more of these things.

518
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:25,500
Yeah.

519
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,500
It's worth it that there's no end to it.

520
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,500
I don't know when it'll be.

521
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,500
There's going to be an event for Japanese television.

522
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:34,500
It's going to be the...

523
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:37,500
America's Greatest Ultra Quiz.

524
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,500
Yeah.

525
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:47,760
And in the fall, the

526
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:39,760
And in the fall, the

527
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,500
No, it's the Ultra Quiz.

528
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,500
I can't go.

529
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:45,500
You're not going?

530
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:46,500
You're not going?

531
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,500
I'm not going.

532
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:50,500
I can't go.

533
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:53,500
What do you want to do?

534
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:59,500
I don't know what to do.

535
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:02,500
I should think about it.

536
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,500
I'll answer you here.

537
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:05,500
Yeah.

538
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,500
That's it.

539
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:11,500
And today, the lady who came in the public.

540
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,500
I've been ignoring her.

541
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:16,500
I haven't been to the public in a long time.

542
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:23,500
I've been observing the public, so I've really been following.

543
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:19,500
I've been watching.

544
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,500
I've never been to the public and I've never.

545
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:26,500
I've been by myself.

546
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,500
I've never been to the public.

547
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:23,500
I've never been.

548
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:27,500
I've never seen her.

549
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:26,500
The day I saw her, I thought,

550
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,500
The day I saw her, I thought,

551
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:29,500
I'm gonna be so nice, my wife.

552
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:25,500
I'll always be here.

553
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,500
I'm gonna be so nice...

554
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:29,500
