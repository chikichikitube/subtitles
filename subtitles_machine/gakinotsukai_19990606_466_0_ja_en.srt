1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Next, we will be giving away 1,000,000 yen!

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
The 1st KAKU RENBO tournament!

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
This is the 3rd time.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
This is the 1st time.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
The 1st time was during the winter.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
The 2nd time was for various reasons.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
We couldn't do it.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
The 1st KAKU RENBO tournament was held in December last year.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
We will be giving away 1,000,000 yen!

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
The 2nd KAKU RENBO tournament was held 3 months ago.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:49,000
We will be giving away 1,000,000 yen!

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Who will get the 1,000,000 yen this time?

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Today, we will be giving away 1,000,000 yen!

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
What?

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
What's wrong?

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
It's terrible.

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
A baby was caught during the Heisei era.

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The microphone can't record the cry.

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
You can take it with you.

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
You were caught during the Heisei era, too.

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
What's wrong with that?

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
You were wearing a T-shirt.

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
You were caught during the Heisei era, too.

24
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
That's right.

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Matsumoto-san really likes it.

26
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
You can like me, but don't come to my house and fold my pajamas.

27
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Please don't do that.

28
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
It's a baby.

29
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
It's a baby.

30
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
It's a baby.

31
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
You can't hide it.

32
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
That's right.

33
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
What's wrong with that?

34
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
It's a baby.

35
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
You can't hide it.

36
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
He's crying.

37
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
It's hot!

38
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
It's cold.

39
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
It's hot!

40
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
It's hot!

41
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
It's hot!

42
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
It's hot!

43
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Everyone, look at this.

44
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
It's cold.

45
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
You can look at this.

46
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Wait for a while.

47
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I've done many things, but I can't do this.

48
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
It's a baby.

49
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
It's a baby.

50
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Is it a baby?

51
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
It's a baby.

52
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I can't help it.

53
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
It's a baby.

54
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I can't help it.

55
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
If it's a baby...

56
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:47,000
This program is brought to you by the following sponsors.

57
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
This is a big problem.

58
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:59,000
You shouldn't be doing this. You should call the police.

59
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Why are you doing this to a baby?

60
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
It's cold.

61
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Why are you doing this to me?

62
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
You're the one who did this.

63
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
We're still single.

64
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
We're still single.

65
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
It's sad that you're crying.

66
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Pocchan is so happy.

67
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Pocchan!

68
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Pocchan!

69
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
He's getting closer.

70
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Wait a minute.

71
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I feel sorry for him.

72
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
He's getting older.

73
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
He's a Pikachu.

74
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
He must like Pikachu.

75
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Pocchan, show us how you do it.

76
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I'll do it.

77
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I'll do it.

78
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Welcome.

79
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
It's scary.

80
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
It's scary.

81
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
You should look at the camera.

82
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000
If he's embarrassed, he won't look at the camera.

83
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Pocchan, one, two, three.

84
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
It's scary.

85
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
It's scary.

86
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
It's scary.

87
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
It's scary.

88
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
It's scary.

89
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
It's scary.

90
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
It's scary.

91
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
It's scary.

92
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Pocchan.

93
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Look at that.

94
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Look at that.

95
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
It's scary.

96
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
It's scary.

97
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,000
He's just an old man.

98
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
What are the parents thinking?

99
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
It's terrible.

100
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
It's terrible.

101
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Such a cute child.

102
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Such a cute child.

103
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Excuse me.

104
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Excuse me.

105
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
What?

106
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Did you leave your mom with my dad?

107
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I don't know.

108
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
There's a lot in there.

109
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
What's in here?

110
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I'm not sure.

111
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I'm sure it will make them happy.

112
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I think so too.

113
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Pocchan.

114
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I wonder if it'll make them cry.

115
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Kou-chan, don't do it!

116
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Kou-chan, your head will fall off.

117
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
He doesn't like it.

118
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
He doesn't like it.

119
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
He doesn't like it at all.

120
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
This is really...

121
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Let's change the diaper.

122
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Let's change the diaper.

123
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Ah, this is bad.

124
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
The poop is coming out.

125
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
It's coming out.

126
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
It's coming out.

127
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
It's coming out.

128
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
It's coming out.

129
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
This is a diaper player.

130
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Kou-chan, hang in there.

131
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Kou-chan, hang in there.

132
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
It's cute.

133
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Kou-chan, it's cute.

134
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
It's cute, isn't it?

135
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
You're a fool.

136
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
What is this?

137
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
It's not even a toy.

138
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I wonder if he's hungry.

139
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
You like this, don't you?

140
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I like this.

141
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Ah, yes, yes.

142
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
What is this?

143
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Did you like this?

144
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Did you like this?

145
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Everyone likes this.

146
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Let's go, Kou-chan.

147
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Ah, it's delicious.

148
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Kou-chan, eat a lot.

149
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Kou-chan, eat a lot.

150
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
It's scary.

151
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
It's really scary.

152
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Kou-chan, this is delicious.

153
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Kou-chan, today...

154
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Kou-chan, today...

155
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Thank you.

156
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Kou-chan, Kou-chan, Kou-chan, Kou-chan.

157
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
It's scary.

158
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Kou-chan, Kou-chan, Kou-chan, Kou-chan.

159
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Did you kick that?

160
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Everyone likes this.

161
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Did you kick that?

162
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Ah, he's crying.

163
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
He's crying.

164
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
He's crying.

165
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I understand.

166
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
He wants to go to the bathroom.

167
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I see.

168
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
He wants to go to the bathroom.

169
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
He wants to go to the bathroom.

170
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I see.

171
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
It's dirty.

172
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Kou-chan, you can lie down here.

173
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I'll put you in.

174
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
You can face this way.

175
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Kou-chan, you can go in by yourself.

176
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Kou-chan, what are you doing?

177
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
It's dangerous.

178
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Kou-chan, Kou-chan, Kou-chan, Kou-chan.

179
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Kou-chan.

180
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Kou-chan.

181
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Kou-chan.

182
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Kou-chan, you move fast.

183
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
That's Kou-chan.

184
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
If you get scared, you can...

185
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Kou-chan.

186
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
If you get scared, you can...

187
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Kou-chan.

188
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
...you can get sick.

189
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Here you go.

190
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Kou-chan.

191
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Here you go, Kou-chan.

192
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
It's a good chance.

193
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
You'll get well soon.

194
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Kou-chan.

195
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
You'll get well soon.

196
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
You're getting prettier.

197
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Yes, you're getting prettier.

198
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
You're getting bigger.

199
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Ko-chan, you're getting prettier.

200
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Ko-chan, let's open the box.

201
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Let's open the box.

202
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
What's wrong, Ko-chan?

203
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
What's wrong, Ko-chan?

204
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,000
After all, O-Numa is his father.

205
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
That's right.

206
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
O-Numa is cool.

207
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Totally different.

208
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Oh, it's good, isn't it?

209
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Ko-chan, look!

210
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
This is no good!

211
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Mama!

212
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Mama!

213
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Mama!

214
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Mama!

215
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Mama!

216
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Mama!

217
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,000
What is that?

218
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
That's the suspicious one.

219
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Is that so?

220
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
We don't understand that!

221
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
You can't go with someone you don't know.

222
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,000
You can't go with someone you don't know.

223
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Po-chan went with someone he didn't know.

224
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
He's a very bad kid.

225
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Mama is very worried.

226
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
But when Po-chan came back, Mama was relieved.

227
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Mama and Po-chan were always together.

228
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
But it's the opening of the first one.

229
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Po-chan and Mama

230
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Po-chan and Mama

231
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I've been thinking about this lately.

232
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I don't want to say it now, but...

233
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I used to do a lot of acting, didn't I?

234
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I remember it well, but...

235
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
It would be interesting if there was a pearl like this.

236
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
There was something like that, right?

237
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I remember the answer I wrote.

238
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I wrote a panda.

239
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,000
It's a panda with a lot of heat.

240
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
It was pretty funny, so I remember it well.

241
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Do you remember?

242
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I don't remember.

243
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Do you remember?

244
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Recently, there's a little bit of a boom on the streets.

245
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Tare panda!

246
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
That's definitely my partner!

247
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Is there such a thing as a Tare panda?

248
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
It's a Tare panda, but it's a little bit dirty.

249
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
That's definitely my partner!

250
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Don't make your face so red!

251
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Right?

252
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
That might be the case, but it's cool if it's a stone.

253
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I was so skinny for a moment.

254
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
It's not the same panda!

255
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
It's not a giraffe or a deer.

256
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
It's a panda.

257
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
It's a stone.

258
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I've told you everything.

259
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
It's okay.

260
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I'm not angry.

261
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Well, well.

262
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I borrowed a little bit of your wisdom.

263
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Come and say hello to me.

264
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
It's hard to say hello.

265
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
It's hard to say hello.

266
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

267
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Hey, hey!

268
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
What is it?

269
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I don't think so.

270
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Well, that's right.

271
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
It all starts with a compliment.

272
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Yo-san, you've been ripped off.

273
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I'm angry.

274
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
But that's a character.

275
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,000
It's cute, so I don't think it's going to sell.

276
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:33,000
My bad Mickey Mouse picture.

277
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,000
There was a time when I printed it on a T-shirt and sold it.

278
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
No way!

279
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I'm the only one who can print that.

280
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I don't know.

281
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I mean, in a good way.

282
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:52,000
It's dirty in the toy industry.

283
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
In the toy industry.

284
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
You know what?

285
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Furby.

286
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
The one who talks.

287
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
The one who talks.

288
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
That's definitely a lie.

289
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
What do you mean by a lie?

290
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:08,000
You know, if you stay at home and talk, you'll gradually learn the words.

291
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
It's definitely a lie.

292
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
You can't be fooled.

293
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Why can't you say that?

294
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Here it comes.

295
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Well, then.

296
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
No, you win.

297
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Yes, yes, yes.

298
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Even for a month.

299
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
All right, all right.

300
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
If we live together, we'll do it.

301
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Okay, okay.

302
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
That's a good assist.

303
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Well, then.

304
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Why is that a lie?

305
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I'll tell you in a word.

306
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Go ahead.

307
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I'm not lying.

308
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I see.

309
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
If you hear this.

310
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I see.

311
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
You're really something.

312
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Shut up.

313
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Say it.

314
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Why can't you say that?

315
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Say it again.

316
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
And I'll tell you in a word.

317
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I see.

318
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I'll decide.

319
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Okay, I understand.

320
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Oh, you.

321
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
That man.

322
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Why can't you say that?

323
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
If you say something, you'll say,

324
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Machan is the best.

325
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
You don't have to say that no matter what the answer is.

326
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
It's obvious.

327
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I'll say it.

328
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:25,000
If you hear Machan is the best, you're going to lose your mind.

329
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
And then.

330
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
And then you.

331
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Are you still going to say that?

332
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Please be my partner forever.

333
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I can decide that easily.

334
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
You.

335
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Yes.

336
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I'll say it.

337
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Harvey.

338
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
It's selling well.

339
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
It seems to be selling well recently.

340
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
What is that?

341
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
What is that?

342
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
It's popular in America.

343
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
What is that?

344
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
If you ask, they say it's a new toy.

345
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
They remember what they're talking about.

346
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Harvey himself starts talking.

347
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Yes, he does.

348
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
He went to America and was brought to Japan.

349
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
It's going to be a boom in Japan.

350
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Everyone's going to buy it now.

351
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
They say it's sold out.

352
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
That's amazing.

353
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Don't be fooled.

354
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
That's definitely a lie.

355
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Why can't you say that?

356
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Because it's true.

357
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:24,000
What is that?

358
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Exhibition.

359
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
What is that?

360
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Exhibition.

361
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Why can't you say that?

362
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Exhibition.

363
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
You're the only one who doesn't understand that.

364
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
How am I supposed to follow that?

365
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Exhibition.

366
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
You can't say it in one word.

367
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
If you don't like it, you can't say it.

368
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Okay, okay.

369
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I got it.

370
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Please.

371
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I got it.

372
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I'll definitely say it.

373
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I'll definitely say it, but I'm a little worried.

374
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
What do you mean?

375
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I'm worried if you can do it.

376
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I can do it.

377
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Can I practice?

378
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Maybe if you can't do it, you have to buy a new one.

379
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
You have to buy it.

380
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
It's going to be a big deal, right?

381
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Let's get this going.

382
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
The numbers are going to go boom.

383
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Two Sugachans.

384
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Let's practice.

385
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Please let me practice.

386
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
What? What? What?

387
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Yeah.

388
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Is that what you want to say?

389
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Yeah.

390
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,500
That's the way to say it, right?

391
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,500
What, what, what, what is it?

392
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,500
Right?

393
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,500
Mak-chan is the best!

394
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,500
I'm going to faint!

395
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,500
Hey, wait a minute!

396
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,500
After that, I'm not going anywhere!

397
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,000
What are you saying?

398
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Until when are you going to be my friend?

399
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I'm begging you, Sakai!

400
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
And then I'll be like, ah, ha, ha, ha!

401
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
What are you doing?

402
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
It's up to you.

403
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
No, it's...

404
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
If you bite this, it'll be the worst.

405
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
You'll be a comedian.

406
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
What?

407
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
You'll be a comedian.

408
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Is it really that bad?

409
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Okay, I got it!

410
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Let's go!

411
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I don't care about that!

412
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I don't care about that!

413
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Let's go!

414
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
And then we'll start.

415
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Let's go!

416
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
And then we'll start.

417
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
It's called Furby, right?

418
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
It was a hit in America.

419
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
It's a stuffed animal.

420
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
When you talk to it, it gradually remembers those words.

421
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
And it starts to talk to itself.

422
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
That's right.

423
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
It sold a lot.

424
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
And then Japan did that again.

425
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
When it started selling in Japan, it sold out immediately.

426
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
That's right.

427
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
It's really popular.

428
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
You can't be fooled by that!

429
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Why not?

430
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,000
You can't be fooled by the existence of a Japanese version of that!

431
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I'll do it.

432
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
This is the only solution.

433
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,880
A

434
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:15,000
A

435
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
A

436
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
A

437
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
A

438
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,000
A

439
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
A

440
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
A

441
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
You're doing well.

442
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I'm doing well.

443
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
It's like that.

444
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
What?

445
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
There are a lot of parts.

446
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Furby is popular.

447
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
It's popular.

448
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
I want that, too.

449
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:59,000
This is a question for Mr. Matsumoto, who has read out a number of predictions from various animals.

450
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
That's true.

451
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,000
A live animal predicts the weather.

452
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Yes.

453
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
What does a live animal predict?

454
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Oh?

455
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Oh?

456
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
What?

457
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Oh?

458
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Oh?

459
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
It's a cry.

460
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Oh?

461
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Oh?

462
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
That's what it predicts.

463
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
What does that mean?

464
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Do you understand the meaning of prediction?

465
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Prediction is something you understand before it happens.

466
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
That's right.

467
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:36,000
They predict the weather before they say it.

468
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Why are you making such a frowning face?

469
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Are you Fuji-san's sixth eye?

470
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
You can't do that.

471
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
What do you mean?

472
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Everyone has a prediction ability.

473
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Well, maybe.

474
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Yes.

475
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Do you know what psychokinesis is?

476
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Do you know what pyrokinesis is?

477
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
I don't know, I don't know.

478
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
It's a fire flower.

479
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Oh, I see.

480
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,000
It's an energy radiation ability.

481
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,000
If you think of it like that, for example, your head will burn.

482
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
That kind of power?

483
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
This is called pyrokinesis.

484
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
There are also psychokinesis and other types of nexus.

485
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
I also have a little bit of it.

486
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
What do you have?

487
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
But my ability is very simple.

488
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,000
It's not a very powerful ability.

489
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
It's an ability that's hard to believe.

490
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
You can just move it a little bit in front of your eyes, right?

491
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
For example, you have a stroller, right?

492
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Please push this.

493
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Like this.

494
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Push the stroller.

495
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I'll push it?

496
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Please push it lightly and softly.

497
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Really, don't move!

498
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:54,000
The truth is, with the power you just pushed, you can only move this much.

499
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
But what moved a little more was my...

500
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
...wagokinesis.

501
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
What's a wagokinesis?

502
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Well, it's a wagon, right?

503
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:14,000
You don't have to get caught in a wagon.

504
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
This is my wagokinesis.

505
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
But you can't prove that, can you?

506
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
See?

507
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
If it was true, you could only move this much.

508
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Ah, that was my wagokinesis!

509
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Hey!

510
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Look at me!

511
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
With that,

512
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
wagokinesis...

513
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
...is it normal to move like this?

514
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Ah, it's still a wagokinesis!

515
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
You're too slow!

516
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
After you fall, you do this.

517
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Before you fall, you do this.

518
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
What do you want to say?

519
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Originally, there's this here, and you're here.

520
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,000
If you move like this,

521
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
everyone will say, oh!

522
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
If you push that, the power after that will be broken.

523
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
But isn't this important?

524
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
What do you mean?

525
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Isn't this important?

526
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Who are you?

527
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Originally, you're pulling out your power by adding my power.

528
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
That's hard to understand.

529
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,000
What's easy to understand is that you can move it like this.

530
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
You can reverse it.

531
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
What are you talking about?

532
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
You push it.

533
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
You push it.

534
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,000
You push it.

535
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

536
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
What are you doing?

537
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
You're pulling out your power.

538
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Why are you making such a dirty face?

539
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
That's because,

540
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,000
right now,

541
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
I used reverse wagokinesis.

542
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
What do you mean?

543
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
If I didn't use that, I would have said more.

544
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
You stopped it?

545
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
I stopped it.

546
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
That's not good.

547
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Move this!

548
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
That's not good.

549
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Move this!

550
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Leave it like this.

551
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
It's stopped.

552
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:37,000
I'll protect you!
