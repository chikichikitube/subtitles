1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The day of the New Year's party has come!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:08,000
The 12th Gaki no Tsukariya Line's Chiki Chiki Welcome New Year's Party!

3
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:18,000
This year too, without any evidence, has started!

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
The usual New Year's party!

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I can't do it anymore.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
This year too, I'm the host of the New Year's party!

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Yoshimoto's Mikako Nii Hikobu vs. Yomazaki Hosei!

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
And today, we have invited a special guest.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
First, we have Mr. Hotohara who wants to end the rainy season!

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Mr. Hotohara!

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Nice to meet you!

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Mr. Hotohara, your partner, Mr. Miyasako, isn't here today.

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Yes!

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Mr. Miyasako...

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:57,000
He's at Charity Soccer, so I'm worried about his future.

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
What?

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Excuse me!

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Excuse me!

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Mr. Yamashita Shioda!

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Mr. Yamashita!

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Mr. Yamashita!

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Idiot!

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Excuse me!

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Mr. Yamashita Shioda!

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Are you serious?

26
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Grandma!

27
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Mr. Yamashita Shioda!

28
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
And the first participant this year is...

29
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Mr. Yamada!

30
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Mr. Yamada!

31
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
That's not him.

32
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
That's definitely not him.

33
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
That's not Yamada.

34
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
That's not Yamada.

35
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
That's not Yamada.

36
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
That's not Yamada.

37
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Oh, he said it.

38
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
And the producer of the show, the master of young comedians.

39
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Mr. Tsuga, please say a few words.

40
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Thank you!

41
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
This year...

42
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Unfortunately, it's not an unfavorable situation.

43
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
But I hope you enjoy it.

44
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Thank you again this year.

45
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Thank you!

46
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Next, we have the two mascots of this show.

47
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
From Downtown.

48
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
No, no, no.

49
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
What?

50
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
You're just a mascot.

51
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Thank you.

52
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Please look at the mirror and say hello.

53
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Thank you.

54
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Thank you.

55
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Do you have the last one today?

56
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
What's the last one?

57
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
What?

58
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Do you have the last one?

59
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Of course.

60
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
That's the main thing.

61
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Even if you come out, there are people who say it's cold.

62
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
You can't stop that.

63
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Yamazaki's manager is a girl, right?

64
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I don't know what to say.

65
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
That's the main thing.

66
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I don't know what to say.

67
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
It's pretty tough.

68
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Let's wrap it up.

69
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Let's wrap it up.

70
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Thank you.

71
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Everyone, please say hello to the mirror.

72
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
What?

73
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
What?

74
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
One, two.

75
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Mirror.

76
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
What?

77
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
You're going to say hello to the mirror, right?

78
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
What?

79
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Please take care of us this year as well.

80
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Thank you.

81
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Thank you.

82
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
This program is brought to you by these sponsors.

83
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Everyone, please make a decision.

84
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I'll still take it.

85
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
It's the annual Gaki no Tsukai new year party.

86
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
A delicious drink and a delicious meal.

87
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Everyone takes a sip.

88
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
But in the midst of all this, a single man

89
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
sneaks into Matsumoto.

90
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
It's a bit strange.

91
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I don't know what beer is.

92
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
What kind of mark is that?

93
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
The mark on your chest.

94
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
The mark of the maker.

95
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
That's normal.

96
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
That's normal.

97
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Well, this year is your year, so do your best.

98
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I'm really looking forward to it.

99
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
The 4th Yami Rotsukai.

100
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Chikiduki.

101
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
The 21st Hakuwarai Manzai.

102
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
The 5th.

103
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
This time as well as this time.

104
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Really?

105
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I'm thinking about it.

106
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
And I...

107
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
What are you going to do?

108
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Are you going to join?

109
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I'm a mystery.

110
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Why?

111
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
What's your skill?

112
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I don't know!

113
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I don't know!

114
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
The new year's fun project.

115
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Manzai Dai Gassen.

116
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Out of 25 talent staff members,

117
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
5 teams will be chosen by lottery.

118
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Each team will perform an original manzai.

119
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
First, we will draw lots for the number.

120
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
The first round of the new year.

121
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Thank you!

122
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I don't like it anymore.

123
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I don't like it at all.

124
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Number 3!

125
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Who is it?

126
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Who is it?

127
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
The number 3.

128
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
It's been a while since I saw you.

129
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
It's been a while since I saw you.

130
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
You look cool today, Naguri-san.

131
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Thank you.

132
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Then, Naguri-san,

133
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
please choose the number.

134
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
That's right.

135
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Please.

136
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Who is it?

137
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Number 12.

138
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Who is it?

139
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Number 12.

140
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Thank you.

141
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Thank you.

142
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
And the second round of the lottery.

143
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Number 11.

144
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Who is it?

145
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Number 11.

146
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Thank you.

147
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Thank you.

148
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Thank you.

149
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Thank you.

150
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Thank you.

151
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
The second round of the lottery.

152
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Who is it?

153
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
The director, Otomo.

154
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Then, I will choose the number 3.

155
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Number 9.

156
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Oh, Matsumoto.

157
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Yes.

158
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Number 11.

159
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Number 11.

160
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
It's been a while since I saw you.

161
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Amazing.

162
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
It's been a while since I saw you.

163
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
What do you think of this?

164
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
It's not like that.

165
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
It's not like that.

166
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
It's not like that.

167
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
It's not like that.

168
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
It feels good.

169
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
The way you touch me, it's really soft.

170
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
The side of my belly is really soft.

171
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Does it feel good?

172
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
It feels good.

173
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Then, after this, we will be alone for about an hour.

174
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
We will be alone.

175
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
We have to have a discussion.

176
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Yes.

177
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
It's really scary.

178
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
It's okay, right?

179
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I will do my best.

180
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
What are you talking about?

181
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
What are you talking about?

182
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I am the star of the 21st century.

183
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
The fourth group is Yamashita, a former Jeryzm.

184
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
The fourth group is Yamashita, a former Jeryzm.

185
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
The fourth group is Yamashita, a former Jeryzm.

186
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
This is Hamada.

187
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
This is Hamada.

188
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
And this is Kogoriko.

189
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
And this is Kogoriko.

190
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Good.

191
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
And this is a burnt tennis ball.

192
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
That's right.

193
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Number 10.

194
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Yes.

195
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Tanaka will do it again.

196
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
If Tanaka does it...

197
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I remembered.

198
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I forgot.

199
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Last year, Kogoriko did it.

200
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
That's right.

201
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
It was the most slippery.

202
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
That's right.

203
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
It was the most slippery.

204
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
It was the most slippery.

205
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
It was the most slippery.

206
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
It was the most slippery.

207
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
It was the most slippery.

208
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Tanaka.

209
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Number 14.

210
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
It's me.

211
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
You.

212
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
You're able to take it.

213
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
It's got to be a patriotic fight.

214
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Yeah.

215
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
You need to raise one more person.

216
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Yeah?

217
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Raise the two of them.

218
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Yeah?

219
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
We were standing like this.

220
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
You need to comb your face see it with three of them.

221
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Yes.

222
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Do it like this or two of them.

223
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Like it, huh?

224
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
It's important.

225
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Like it, huh?

226
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
It's important.

227
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Something is interesting.

228
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Someone, Three-Four-Sports get it to me.

229
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
No. 7, Lucky Seven!

230
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
If that was the case...

231
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Can Tanaka and Endo do it?

232
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
No!

233
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Please don't do it!

234
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Please don't do it!

235
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
To be honest, after that...

236
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Amata Hamada wants to do it with me.

237
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Okamaya!

238
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I don't want Okamaya!

239
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I don't want Okoge!

240
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
It's not Okoge. It's the opposite.

241
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
It's Okoge, right?

242
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
It's the opposite.

243
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
It's not Okoge.

244
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
It's Okoge becoming a man.

245
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
It's the same as Tsukagata.

246
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
It's completely different.

247
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Please wait a moment.

248
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
What should we do?

249
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
It's already decided.

250
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Me and Endo...

251
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Please let me do it again.

252
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Please let me do it again.

253
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
This is fine.

254
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
This is fine.

255
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Why?

256
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
If I had to decide,

257
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I'd let one person do it.

258
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
But Amata's Tanaka-san...

259
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
No, you can't do P.

260
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Really.

261
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Really.

262
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Really.

263
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Really.

264
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Really.

265
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Really.

266
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Really.

267
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Really.

268
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Really.

269
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
No P.

270
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
You can do it.

271
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
You can do it.

272
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
You can do it.

273
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
You can do it.

274
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
You can do it.

275
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Tanaka is determined to do the nightmare P.

276
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
And Endo Hamada is determined to do the Tsukkomi-Konbi.

277
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
In addition, Matsumoto and Okamashi Shirono are full of expectations.

278
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
The combination of the director Otomo, Amiagari, and Hotohara.

279
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Hanazeka Yamashita and the natural director, Sakamoto, are entering.

280
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
And the dangerous 120% staff combination.

281
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
For the sake of a peaceful fight, the third person is chosen.

282
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Number 21.

283
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Number 21 isn't here.

284
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Please wait a moment.

285
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
You again.

286
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Yamazaki-san.

287
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
You again.

288
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Yamazaki-san.

289
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,000
The sixth group is decided by Yamazaki's entry into the trio.

290
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
The six groups that have been entered.

291
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Let's start the meeting of the famous story.

292
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
It's a new year's party, but it's the first stage of the 21st century.

293
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
You can't slip.

294
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Everyone is fighting against that pressure.

295
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
After all, it seems that there are various ideas depending on each group.

296
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
It's just squeezed.

297
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I'm Hiroshi Fujiwara of Yoshimoto Industrial Co., Ltd.

298
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I'm sorry.

299
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Fujiwara, I can't stop you.

300
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I'd like to start the first group.

301
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Hamada-san and Endo-san.

302
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
The theme is snake year.

303
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Please.

304
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
It's the 21st century.

305
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I'm going to do my best in the 21st century.

306
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Everyone is talking about 2001.

307
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
What are you talking about?

308
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Everyone is talking about 2001.

309
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
What are you talking about?

310
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Everyone is talking about 2001.

311
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Do you know the theme of this year?

312
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Of course I know.

313
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:15,000
This year is the year of the snake.

314
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
This year is the year of the snake.

315
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
But if it's the year of the snake, it's the year of the mouth.

316
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
The mouth is a hot topic.

317
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Really?

318
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
The mouth is a hot topic.

319
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
If you catch it, it will be money.

320
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Who is dirty?

321
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I don't know.

322
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I don't know.

323
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
The prize money has changed.

324
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Let's go catch it.

325
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Okay.

326
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Endo-kun.

327
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Yes.

328
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
That hole is suspicious.

329
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
It's in that hole.

330
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
There are 600 coins in that hole.

331
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Okay.

332
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Let's go catch it.

333
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Can you take a look?

334
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
This is...

335
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
This is...

336
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
There is a rock.

337
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Hamaya-san.

338
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Yes.

339
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
There seems to be a rock on the hole.

340
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I see.

341
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I'll hold this rock.

342
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Please look at this hole.

343
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I see.

344
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
There may be a rock.

345
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Please.

346
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Let's go.

347
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
How is it?

348
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Endo-kun.

349
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Yes.

350
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
It's hard to run.

351
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Is that so?

352
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
That's strange.

353
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
The rock is perfect.

354
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Endo-kun.

355
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Yes.

356
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Don't move too much.

357
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I understand.

358
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I'll push the rock.

359
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Endo-kun, get up.

360
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Yes.

361
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
It's better to go inside.

362
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I don't know, Endo-kun.

363
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
It's strange.

364
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
What?

365
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Endo-kun.

366
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
What is that hole on the top?

367
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
There must be a piece of dirt.

368
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Is that so?

369
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
There must be a piece of dirt.

370
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Endo-kun, please take a look.

371
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Me?

372
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I'm fine.

373
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Wait a minute.

374
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Endo-kun, please take a look.

375
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Hamaya-san, please take a look.

376
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
No, I can't.

377
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Endo-kun, please take a look.

378
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Hamada-san, please take a look.

379
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Endo-kun, please take a look.

380
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Hamada-san is good.

381
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Endo-kun, I'll support you.

382
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Are you sure?

383
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Yes.

384
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Please take a look.

385
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I'm here.

386
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I'm here.

387
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Endo-kun.

388
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Endo-kun.

389
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Yes.

390
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
What's wrong?

391
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Hamada-san, what's wrong?

392
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Endo-kun.

393
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Yes.

394
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Endo-kun, I'm here.

395
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I understand.

396
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I'm not here anymore.

397
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Let's go home.

398
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Let's go home.

399
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Please take care of me.

400
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I want to catch you somehow.

401
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Yes.

402
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
If you could do a shoulder-wheel, I might be able to see you.

403
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Shoulder-wheel?

404
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Yes.

405
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Are you sure?

406
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Then, it's fine.

407
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Then, just a little.

408
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Yes.

409
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Here we go.

410
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Then, please.

411
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Endo-kun.

412
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Yes.

413
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Behind you.

414
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Behind.

415
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
The shoulder-wheel is behind.

416
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
The shoulder-wheel is behind.

417
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Please.

418
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Then, let's go.

419
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Endo-kun.

420
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Endo-kun.

421
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Endo-kun.

422
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Endo-kun.

423
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Endo-kun, don't move too much.

424
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Yes.

425
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Endo-kun, don't move.

426
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Endo-kun, don't move.

427
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Endo-kun, don't move.

428
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Endo-kun.

429
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
What's wrong?

430
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
There's a moon child.

431
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Hamada-san.

432
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
This is ***.

433
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Thank you very much.

434
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Thank you very much.

435
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Thank you very much.

436
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Thank you very much.

437
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Hotohara-san and Otomo-san.

438
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
The theme is Kimo-Taku and Kudo Shizuka.

439
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
It's a marriage.

440
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Please.

441
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Hello.

442
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Hello.

443
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I'm Hotohara.

444
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I'm Otomo.

445
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Together with Spain.

446
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Don Tacos.

447
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Don Tacos.

448
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Don Tacos.

449
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Don Tacos.

450
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Don Tacos.

451
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Don Tacos.

452
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Don't dance.

453
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Don't dance.

454
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Don't dance.

455
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
There were many stories of the 20th century.

456
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
But the most memorable one is...

457
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
What are you looking at?

458
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Where are you looking?

459
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
What are you thinking?

460
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Why do you talk?

461
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Really?

462
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Really?

463
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
What was the most memorable?

464
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Kimutaku and Kudo Shizuka got married, right?

465
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
That's amazing

466
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Right?

467
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
They got married

468
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
They got married, right?

469
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
That was the most memorable

470
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
That's right

471
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
What was the most memorable?

472
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
The press conference

473
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
The press conference

474
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
That was great

475
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Excuse me, do you have any comments?

476
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
What are you talking about?

477
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
It's not about who did it

478
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
No, it's about Kimutaku

479
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Right?

480
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Do you have any comments?

481
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
It was great

482
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
That's your personal opinion

483
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Don't do that

484
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Thank you

485
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Thank you

486
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Don't do that

487
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Don't do that

488
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Don't do that

489
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
It took an hour

490
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
What was that?

491
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
You guys are not good

492
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
You should have said that

493
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Let's move on to the third question

494
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Yamashita and Sakamoto

495
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
The topic is Ichiro Major

496
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Please

497
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Hello

498
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I'm Zomo

499
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I'm Zomara

500
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Two people plus alpha

501
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
We started

502
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Last year, many people participated

503
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
But this year, in the 21st century

504
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
The person who will be active

505
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
It's Ichiro

506
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
It's tough

507
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
No, you are the one who is tough

508
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
You are Ichiro

509
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Do you know Ichiro?

510
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I know him

511
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
It's you

512
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I lost to loneliness

513
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,000
No, I lost to the world

514
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Don't do that

515
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
What are you doing?

516
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Yamazaki, Irie and Heipo

517
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
The topic is the 21st century

518
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Please

519
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I'm Fukun

520
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I'm Raku

521
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Don't hit me

522
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
The 21st century

523
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
The zoo will change

524
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
The zoo will have more people and animals

525
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Let's go to the zoo

526
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
It's a monkey mountain

527
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I don't like monkeys

528
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
What?

529
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
That monkey

530
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
What?

531
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Is it active?

532
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:26,000
It's a female

533
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I'm angry

534
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Let's see more

535
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Why did you do that?

536
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,000
It's a female monkey

537
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
What are you doing?

538
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I'm sorry

539
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I don't like monkeys

540
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Let's go to another place

541
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
What is this?

542
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Gorilla?

543
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
It's a male gorilla

544
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
What is the topic?

545
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,000
The 21st century

546
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,000
The zoo will have more people and animals

547
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Let's go to the zoo

548
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Matsumoto and Shiono

549
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
The topic is the Sydney Olympics

550
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Please

551
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Matsumoto

552
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I'm Matsumoto

553
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I'm Shiono

554
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Let's see more

555
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I don't like it

556
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Let's see more

557
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I don't want to turn off the lights

558
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I don't want to wear gloves

559
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I don't like this character

560
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I'm sorry

561
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
What are you talking about?

562
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
You are so funny

563
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Let's do our best

564
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
There were many things last year

565
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
I'm worried about the Olympics

566
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
It was amazing

567
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
It only opens once every four years

568
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,000
It only opens once every four years?

569
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Compared to that

570
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Every night

571
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I don't care who it is

572
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:17,000
I don't care

573
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I swatted

574
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
What?

575
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
You are talking too cute

576
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
That's not true

577
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
I don't say things like that

578
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
When you look at the Olympics

579
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
There are many people

580
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,800
in theamię

581
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:38,800
I remember that. Who else do you remember, Shiono-kun?

582
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:42,800
I remember the strongest man on the ground.

583
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:43,800
Yes, yes, yes.

584
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:44,800
Carl Lewis.

585
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,800
That's Carl Lewis.

586
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,800
What are you talking about? That's not him.

587
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,800
I remember the other guy.

588
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:53,800
He was a swimmer.

589
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,800
He's become a buzzword.

590
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,800
He said, I'm so frustrated.

591
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:57,800
Tajima, right?

592
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,800
Who else do you remember, Shiono-kun?

593
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,800
I remember the strongest Russian wrestler.

594
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:03,800
Yes, yes, yes.

595
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,800
Alexander Karelin.

596
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:06,800
That's Karelin.

597
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,800
Kibusaki Akiyama is all about Kare.

598
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:14,800
It's so embarrassing in front of people.

599
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,800
I made a mistake with the salt.

600
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,800
I put salt on it.

601
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,800
Your voice is too loud.

602
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,800
It's kind of realistic.

603
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,800
It's really different.

604
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:33,800
I can't help but be angry.

605
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,800
There was a Japanese judo player.

606
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:38,800
He won by one point.

607
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:40,800
Shinohara.

608
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:44,800
I think that was Shinohara's one point win.

609
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:48,800
I think that was Doie's one point win.

610
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:49,800
That's not true.

611
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:50,800
That was Shinohara's one point win.

612
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,800
That's exactly right.

613
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:52,800
Okay, I got it.

614
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:55,800
Let's do it again in slow motion.

615
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,800
Then you can see it clearly.

616
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:58,800
Let's do that.

617
00:21:58,800 --> 00:21:59,800
I'm Shinohara.

618
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:00,800
I'm Doie.

619
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,800
Okay, let's do it.

620
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,800
Let's do it.

621
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,800
You're quite a technician.

622
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:22,800
You lost.

623
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,800
Why did you lose?

624
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:27,800
But that was completely one point.

625
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,800
What are you doing?

626
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:30,800
Stop it.

627
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,800
I'm Tanaka.

628
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,800
The topic for today is

629
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:43,800
the IT revolution and me and Tonbo.

630
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:44,800
Please.

631
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:49,800
The IT revolution and me and Tonbo

632
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,800
Let's do it one more time.

633
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:02,800
You're high tension.

634
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:03,800
You're high tension.

635
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,800
The IT revolution.

636
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:12,800
The IT revolution and me and Tonbo

637
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:22,800
The IT revolution and me and Tonbo

638
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:30,800
Tonbo

639
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:32,800
That's not true.

640
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:37,800
I'm sorry.

641
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,800
We did it again this year.

642
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:46,800
How was it?

643
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,800
Well, there were many things.

644
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,800
The combination of the top batter was

645
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:53,800
not only cowardly,

646
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:56,800
but also dirty.

647
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:59,800
I don't like it when it's so difficult.

648
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:00,800
To be honest.

649
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,800
When Shiho came here,

650
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,800
he smelled like shampoo.

651
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:29,800
What is this?
