00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,400
Yōkan-kan

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:06,400
Yōkan-kan

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:12,200
Yōkan-fusai wa nakayoshi da

4
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:16,400
Itsumo futari de mitsuyōkan

5
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,600
Yōkan no dana

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,400
Yōkan no yome

7
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,400
Yoru wa kuriyōkan

8
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:31,400
Ha-ha!

9
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:32,400
Well, everyone.

10
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,900
Well, that's it.

11
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:34,400
What?

12
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,900
Do you want to call it an industry term or an entertainer term?

13
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:37,400
Yes.

14
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,400
Well, the audience doesn't laugh that much.

15
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,900
Even if they laugh, they don't have the endurance.

16
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:45,900
It's like, ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-ha.

17
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:49,400
We say, well, today's guest is heavy.

18
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,400
Yes, yes.

19
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:54,400
Well, today's guest is heavy.

20
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:57,400
Hey, you said it first.

21
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,400
Hey, you're not here today.

22
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:02,400
You're fat.

23
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:05,400
You can't do that.

24
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,400
You're shiny.

25
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,400
I've been blowing.

26
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,400
You're really shiny.

27
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:15,400
When he said, I'm water and oil,

28
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:18,400
you definitely said, you're oil.

29
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,400
Ha-ha-ha-ha.

30
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,400
You shouldn't have made such a mistake.

31
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,400
No, no, that's not true.

32
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,400
Even though you're fat.

33
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,400
Shut up.

34
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,400
Shut up.

35
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,400
Well, there's a lot of things.

36
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,400
Let's do our best.

37
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,400
Let's do it.

38
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,400
What is it?

39
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,400
You seem to be very angry these days.

40
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,400
Who are you?

41
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,400
I'm not angry at all.

42
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:50,400
It seems that you want to say something about your master's lover.

43
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:53,400
Well, it's a rare thing.

44
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,400
I don't talk much before the show,

45
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,400
but Hamada came over and said,

46
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:00,400
I want to talk about my master today.

47
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,400
Ha-ha-ha-ha.

48
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,400
Give me some time.

49
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:07,400
I want two hours.

50
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,400
Ha-ha-ha.

51
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:12,400
I can't give you that much time.

52
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,400
Here you are.

53
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,400
I can't say anything.

54
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,400
Don't you have anything to say?

55
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,400
I don't have anything to say.

56
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,400
That's right.

57
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,400
It's okay.

58
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,400
I can't use this kind of story.

59
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,400
I can't use this kind of story.

60
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,400
I'm serious.

61
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,400
I'm talking about Go Hiromi.

62
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:34,400
Ha-ha-ha-ha.

63
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,400
I want three hours.

64
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:40,400
Do you have more than three hours?

65
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,400
I don't know.

66
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,400
What's going on?

67
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,400
Nothing.

68
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,400
I don't want to talk about my master anymore.

69
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,400
Why?

70
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,400
The audience is dark.

71
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,400
Ha-ha-ha-ha.

72
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,400
It's all in the show.

73
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,400
Really.

74
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,400
Don't drink alcohol.

75
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,400
You look like a bourgeois.

76
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,400
Ha-ha-ha-ha.

77
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,400
Who are you?

78
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,400
I want to invite a comedian to my house.

79
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,400
Shut up.

80
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:08,400
I saw a comedian today.

81
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,400
You shouldn't drink alcohol.

82
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,400
I went to see a comedian in Kansai today.

83
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,400
It's boring.

84
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,400
A comedian.

85
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,400
A comedian is no good.

86
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,400
It's like that.

87
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,400
Ha-ha-ha-ha.

88
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,400
The person who was late today is this person.

89
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,400
Why are you booing at that time?

90
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,400
Ha-ha-ha-ha.

91
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,400
You're always booing at that time.

92
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,400
It's a fate.

93
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,400
This is good.

94
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,400
It's good to be fast.

95
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,400
The comedian is fast.

96
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,400
Don't drink alcohol.

97
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,400
You're late.

98
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,400
I'm not late.

99
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,400
I was late.

100
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,400
I'm not late.

101
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,400
What time did you wake up?

102
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,400
1 o'clock.

103
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:58,400
What is the time?

104
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,400
I woke up at 1 o'clock.

105
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,400
It's boring.

106
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,400
I woke up at 1 o'clock.

107
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,400
It's disgusting.

108
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,400
Why is it disgusting?

109
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,400
I woke up at 1 o'clock.

110
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,400
It's cold.

111
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,400
It's cold.

112
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,400
My eyelids went up.

113
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,400
Your eyelids went up.

114
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,400
Ha-ha-ha-ha.

115
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:28,400
This thin skin went up.

116
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,400
I knew what happened.

117
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,400
I was surprised.

118
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:37,400
Ha-ha-ha-ha.

119
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,400
Is it like this?

120
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,400
I really don't do my best.

121
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,400
Your neck will be scratched.

122
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,400
It's okay.

123
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,400
Why?

124
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,400
I like it.

125
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,400
I don't think it's hard.

126
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,400
I don't think it's hard.

127
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,400
I think it's hard.

128
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,400
Really?

129
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,400
If you move to another show, the show will collapse.

130
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,400
It's okay.

131
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:09,400
It's okay.

132
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:13,400
I talked too much.

133
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:23,400
Chef Matsumoto, who graduated from Hattori Cooking School with the highest grade in history.

134
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:36,400
Please tell me about the new standard of cooking, Akasatana, which is said to be more important than the basics of cooking.

135
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,400
Do you do the basics?

136
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,400
I do.

137
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:43,400
Please tell me.

138
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,400
I don't want to tell you today.

139
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,400
Please tell me.

140
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,400
Sugar.

141
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,400
Salt.

142
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,400
Vinegar.

143
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,400
Soy sauce.

144
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,400
Why soy sauce?

145
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,400
Is it the standard of cooking?

146
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,400
Yes.

147
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,400
Is that so?

148
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,400
That's right.

149
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,400
Soy sauce.

150
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,400
Vinegar.

151
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,400
Miso.

152
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:06,400
It's Miso.

153
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,400
It's Miso.

154
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,400
It's Miso.

155
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:12,400
Is that all you know?

156
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,400
I can't forgive such a thing.

157
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,400
It's impossible.

158
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,400
I don't know who decided it.

159
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,400
I want to make a lot of money.

160
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,400
And I thought.

161
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,400
Please tell me.

162
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:32,400
Sashizusaso is about all the seasonings.

163
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,400
This is different.

164
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,400
I see.

165
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:40,400
Akasatana is about the tools related to it.

166
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,400
Is that so?

167
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,400
That's right.

168
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,400
This will be a great lesson.

169
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,400
What is it?

170
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,400
What is it?

171
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,400
What is it?

172
00:06:51,400 --> 00:07:08,400
What is it?

173
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:14,400
What is it?

174
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,400
Please tell me the tools.

175
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,400
Tools?

176
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,400
Akasatana.

177
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,400
A net.

178
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,400
When you grill fish.

179
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,400
Without a doubt.

180
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,400
Can you grill fish without a net?

181
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,400
Can you grill fish without a net?

182
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,400
Why are you saying it again?

183
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,400
Just say it once.

184
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,400
Skin?

185
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,400
What?

186
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,400
Oh, oh, oh.

187
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,400
Kama.

188
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,400
Kama?

189
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,400
It's Kama.

190
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,400
You need a Kama to make rice.

191
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:51,400
You need a Kama to make rice.

192
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,400
Sa?

193
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,400
What?

194
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,400
Sa.

195
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,400
Just say it once.

196
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:01,400
Saibashi.

197
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,400
What?

198
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,400
If you don't have a saibashi, it will be too hot.

199
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,400
It will be too hot.

200
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,400
Saibashi, saibashi, saibashi.

201
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,400
It will be too hot.

202
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,400
Sa.

203
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,400
Ta.

204
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,400
What?

205
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,400
Just say it once.

206
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,400
Ta.

207
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,400
What do you think it is?

208
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,400
I don't know.

209
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,400
It's a net.

210
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,400
It's a tool, right?

211
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,400
That's right.

212
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,400
Ao.

213
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,400
That's right.

214
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,400
I remembered.

215
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,400
It's a shelf.

216
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,400
A shelf?

217
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,400
A shelf.

218
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,400
Why a shelf?

219
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:37,400
When you can't use what you've said before.

220
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,400
A shelf is okay.

221
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,400
It's a shelf.

222
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,400
That's the point.

223
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:44,400
When you can't use what you've said before.

224
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,400
It's a tool, right?

225
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,400
Yes.

226
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,400
It's a shelf.

227
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,400
It's a shelf.

228
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,400
A net.

229
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:52,400
A Kama.

230
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,400
Saibashi.

231
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:58,400
A shelf.

232
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:17,400
Na-do.

233
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:23,400
Are you crying?

234
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:31,400
Matsumoto-san has the image of walking for 12 minutes.

235
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,400
Are you ready?

236
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,400
I didn't know that.

237
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:37,400
I'll do my best.

238
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,400
When you walk home.

239
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,400
Yes.

240
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:43,400
The part of the heel of the shoe often comes forward.

241
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,400
Matsumoto-san.

242
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,400
Whose work is this?

243
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:57,400
In the world, they say that there is no criminal who hates people and hates sin.

244
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,400
That's all a lie.

245
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,400
No matter what happens, there is a criminal.

246
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,400
There is a criminal.

247
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,400
There is a criminal.

248
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,400
I don't want to be a criminal if there is no criminal.

249
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,400
I see.

250
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,400
Even if you are said to be a genius.

251
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:12,400
In the end, it's a small pile of sins that humans have committed.

252
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,400
Right?

253
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,400
Hespo Kasparu.

254
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,400
I'm scared.

255
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,400
Tell me who did it under the shoe.

256
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:22,400
Let's say it in English.

257
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,400
I stopped speaking English.

258
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:26,400
What?

259
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,400
Who did it?

260
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,400
For example, a cat.

261
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:32,400
It's not a cat.

262
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,400
I know.

263
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,400
It's not a cat.

264
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,400
A cat did it.

265
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,400
I know if a cat did it.

266
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:39,400
I know if a cat came and did this.

267
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:42,400
But the answer is a cat.

268
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,400
It's not a cat.

269
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,400
Let's do it properly.

270
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,400
What is it?

271
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:50,400
I said it's not a cat.

272
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:55,400
This is a question for Mr. Matsumoto who defeated his father and entered the entertainment world.

273
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,400
Yes.

274
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,400
He says that he will surpass his parents someday.

275
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:01,400
Does he have a time to surpass his seniors?

276
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:04,400
This is difficult.

277
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:08,400
What do you mean?

278
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,400
I don't understand at all.

279
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:15,400
It's better to say it under the shoe.

280
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:20,400
You're not doing it properly.

281
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,400
I don't understand.

282
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,400
Why?

283
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:31,400
In the case of work, when a junior surpasses a senior, there is such a number of work.

284
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,400
That's right.

285
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,400
It's strange to ask such a question.

286
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,400
That's right.

287
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,400
I think so.

288
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,400
I think so.

289
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:43,400
I can't make a mistake like this.

290
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:47,400
I think it's better to say it under the shoe.

291
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:50,400
But there is no such thing as under the shoe.

292
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:53,400
There is no such thing as under the shoe.

293
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:58,400
I said that the rubber was loose, so I was walking.

294
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,400
Who is laughing?

295
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,400
No.

296
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,400
No.

297
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,400
Wait a minute.

298
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:07,400
That's too honest.

299
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:11,400
What is your job?

300
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:16,400
What is your job?

301
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:20,400
What is your job?

302
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,400
Why are you here?

303
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:24,400
What is your job?

304
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,400
I'm just fooling around.

305
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:28,400
You can't say it loudly.

306
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:31,400
You can't say it loudly.

307
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,400
I'm just fooling around.

308
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:41,400
I'm just fooling around.

309
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:44,400
I'm just fooling around.

310
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,400
I'm just fooling around.

311
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,400
I'm just fooling around.

312
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:54,400
Say it out loud.

313
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:59,400
What is your attitude?

314
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:05,400
What is your attitude?

315
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:08,400
What is your attitude?

316
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:17,400
What is your attitude?

317
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:20,400
I'm scared.

318
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,400
Are you?

319
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,400
Yes.

320
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:30,400
I'm scared.

321
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,400
I'm so nervous.

322
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:54,400
I'm so nervous.
