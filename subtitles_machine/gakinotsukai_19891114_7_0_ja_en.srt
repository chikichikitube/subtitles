1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Now, in the downtown area,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
From the Philippines?

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
No.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
We are in Shinjuku.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
What are you doing?

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Are you from Osaka?

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Can you speak a little Japanese?

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I can't speak at all, you idiot.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Good evening.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
You are younger than the old lady.

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I'm older than her.

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Do you want it?

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Give it to me.

14
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Thank you.

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I'll take it.

16
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Thank you.

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Can I put it on your chest?

18
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
No.

19
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Where can I put it? It's so long.

20
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
All right.

21
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
This is the first time I've done this.

22
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
It's not open.

23
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
It's good.

24
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'll take it.

25
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Thank you very much.

26
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
This program,

27
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I'll give you a bouquet of flowers.

28
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Good.

29
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Hey, look at him.

30
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
He's walking with his butt out.

31
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Isn't it surprisingly interesting?

32
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
What?

33
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
A black man comes out of a barbershop.

34
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'm from Anse.

35
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
That's right.

36
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
If you want, you can come here.

37
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm impressed by the gold leaf that glitters.

38
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
This is the comedy theater.

39
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Is it on the fifth floor of this building?

40
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Yes.

41
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
This is the comedy theater.

42
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
It's the seventh time.

43
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
It's the seventh time.

44
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I'd like to know how you're doing.

45
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Ladies and gentlemen.

46
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Hello.

47
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I feel like I've been in the city for a long time.

48
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I've been a little off until now.

49
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
It's the biggest one so far.

50
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
That's right.

51
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
The hut.

52
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Isn't it a hut?

53
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
There were quite a few customers in Jeju.

54
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
That's right.

55
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Everyone is calm today.

56
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
There's a lot of people here.

57
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
It's like an experimental mall.

58
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
It's like saying something funny.

59
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
What will happen?

60
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I don't know if it's going to be a hard fight.

61
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
There is a boom now.

62
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
There is a lot.

63
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
It's a little bit of a boom, but it's called a psychic boom.

64
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
That's amazing.

65
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Mr. Marikku is still a figurehead.

66
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
He's a great guy.

67
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
He's just doing that.

68
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Do you know? Well, you know it, don't you?

69
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Recently, Yuigera used to say something like this, right?

70
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Not recently.

71
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Mark.

72
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Just watching.

73
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
He just looked at me and did a little, and then...

74
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
He threw a cigarette at the endama.

75
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
After he threw it, he inhaled it.

76
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:41,000
It's amazing.

77
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
What's with that face?

78
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Put 200 yen in a cup, and if you do something to the bottom, it will fall down.

79
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Anyway, it's amazing that you can break the spoon just by looking at it.

80
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
You're a curly pear, aren't you?

81
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
What are you talking about?

82
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
What's so great about it?

83
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
What's not?

84
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
What's so great about it?

85
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
You're breaking the spoon, aren't you? You're breaking the spoon just by looking at it.

86
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
That's right.

87
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
That's right. Why don't you try it? Can you do it?

88
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
You're breaking the spoon just by looking at it.

89
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
You shouldn't do that.

90
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
What?

91
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
You shouldn't break the spoon.

92
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
No.

93
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
You shouldn't do that.

94
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
You're breaking it.

95
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Go home and break all the spoons in the house.

96
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
You'll get angry.

97
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
You're breaking the spoon.

98
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I think you shouldn't do that.

99
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I can't accept it.

100
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Don't do it.

101
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
You'll get angry if you look at the spoon maker.

102
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
You made it so hard.

103
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
You're so surprised.

104
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
You have superpowers.

105
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
You're so popular that you're going to eat curry all over Japan.

106
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
What?

107
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
You have superpowers.

108
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
You're so popular that you're going to eat curry all over Japan.

109
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I can accept that.

110
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
That's right.

111
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
What?

112
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Ki.

113
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Everyone knows that I laugh.

114
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Ki.

115
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
He's an old man from Nishino.

116
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Do you know that old man is amazing?

117
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
He doesn't touch people.

118
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
He's an old man.

119
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
He's jumping over the wall.

120
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
He's not a normal person.

121
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Judo, Karate, Aikido.

122
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
He's a wrinkle.

123
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
He's a wrinkle.

124
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
He's a painter.

125
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
He's a painter.

126
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
He's so strong.

127
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
He doesn't touch people.

128
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Ha!

129
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Tunga!

130
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Did this guy call you an old man from Nishino a fool?

131
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Ha?

132
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
What?

133
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Did he call you an old man from Nishino a fool?

134
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
No.

135
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Then you shouldn't do that.

136
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
You didn't do anything.

137
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Don't you feel sorry for being called an old man from Nishino?

138
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Ki.

139
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
He's just saying that he'll jump over the wall.

140
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
He's a trouble maker.

141
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
He's a friend.

142
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
He's a friend.

143
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
He's a person who was thrown over the wall.

144
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
If you're so popular that you're going to eat curry all over Japan, what can you do?

145
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
You're so popular that you're going to eat curry all over Japan, what can you do?

146
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
That's right.

147
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
He's talking about Ki.

148
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
He's talking about that he'll jump over the wall.

149
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I'll admit it.

150
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
If you admit it, I'll admit it.

151
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Everyone will be surprised.

152
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
It's over now, but Tsumura Illusion.

153
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Huh?

154
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Did you see it?

155
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
He's the only white tiger in the world.

156
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Yeah.

157
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Did you know that?

158
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
He's the only white tiger in the world.

159
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I'll get rid of him in an instant.

160
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
It's close.

161
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Why?

162
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
What's so important about it?

163
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
What's so important about it?

164
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I don't want to erase it forever.

165
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I'll get rid of him in an instant.

166
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
It's discrimination.

167
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
It has nothing to do with it.

168
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
It's strange.

169
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Don't say things you don't mean.

170
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
What are you talking about?

171
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I don't like that kind of boom.

172
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
You don't like it?

173
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
You're talking about the fortune-telling boom, right?

174
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Yeah.

175
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I have a fortune-teller.

176
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
It's not about winning.

177
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Fortune-telling is endless.

178
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Even if it starts with a nose fortune-telling,

179
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Seiza,

180
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Tokuro,

181
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Ketsueki,

182
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I like fortune-telling these days.

183
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Fortune-telling is...

184
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
What?

185
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
You should think about a new fortune-telling.

186
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I'm thinking about it.

187
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
This is a boom.

188
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Seiza, fortune-telling, Ketsueki, Tokuro,

189
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
These are all new fortune-telling.

190
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
New fortune-telling.

191
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
What kind of fortune-telling?

192
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Ko-ranger fortune-telling.

193
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
What kind of ranger do you like?

194
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
How about this?

195
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
If you like Momo ranger, what is it?

196
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
If you like Momo.

197
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
It's the same!

198
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
If you like Akari ranger, what is it?

199
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Akari ranger.

200
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
You like it so much that you can't speak.

201
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
If you like Momo ranger, you like Momo.

202
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
What are you talking about?

203
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I'm talking about the gourmet boom.

204
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
There is such a thing.

205
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
There is such a thing.

206
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
So, from a far away, from a countryside.

207
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I think I'll eat the food of the land.

208
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Good evening, everyone.

209
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I am not in a good mood.

210
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Today...

211
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I'm in Gunma prefecture.

212
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Gunma prefecture is a otaku of Mr. Hitoshi Matsumoto.

213
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
What will he eat today?

214
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Hello, Masumoto-san.

215
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Good evening.

216
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Thank you for coming today.

217
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Really, how should I put it...

218
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I'm surrounded by this great nature...

219
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,000
In this great environment...

220
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:07,000
This is a great environment, isn't it, otaku?

221
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
No, it's not.

222
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I'm surrounded by this great nature, isn't it?

223
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Isn't it a great environment, Masumoto-san?

224
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Wait, stop it.

225
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Masumoto-san.

226
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Yes?

227
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
You can't do that.

228
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
The camera is rolling, you know.

229
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
What's with that look?

230
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I'm going to hit you.

231
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
This is a program, you know.

232
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I'm going up.

233
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Please give it back, as usual.

234
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
You can just talk normally.

235
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I'm begging you, really.

236
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I'm going through this in a short period of time.

237
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Good evening, everyone.

238
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I'm going through this in a short period of time.

239
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I'm going through this in a short period of time.

240
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Today, I'm Masumoto's otaku.

241
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Hello, Masumoto-san.

242
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Good evening.

243
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
You're surrounded by this great nature, aren't you, otaku?

244
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,000
It's not true.

245
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
What are you doing?

246
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
It's not true.

247
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Wait, stop it.

248
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
It's not true.

249
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Is that so?

250
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Be humble.

251
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
It's not true if you don't praise me.

252
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Be humble.

253
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I'm begging you.

254
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Again?

255
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Again?

256
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Yes, yes, yes.

257
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Good evening, everyone.

258
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Good evening, both you and me.

259
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Good evening.

260
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
You're surrounded by this great nature, aren't you, otaku?

261
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
It's not true.

262
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
It's not true.

263
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Is that so?

264
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I'm going through this in a short period of time.

265
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I'm already on the table.

266
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Masumoto-san, what is this?

267
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
It's a rag.

268
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Wait, stop it.

269
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Don't mess with me.

270
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Why are you putting out a rag?

271
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
It's true.

272
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I'm angry.

273
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Put it out.

274
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Put out something else.

275
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Are you waiting?

276
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
It's this, isn't it, Masumoto-san?

277
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
What is this, Masumoto-san?

278
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
It's a grandpa.

279
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Wait, wait.

280
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Don't mess with me.

281
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:36,000
It's not true.

282
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Why are you putting out a rag?

283
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
It's true.

284
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Put it out.

285
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Put out something else.

286
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I'm going through this in a short period of time.

287
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Are you waiting?

288
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Good evening, both you and me.

289
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Good evening, both you and me.

290
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
It's this, isn't it, Masumoto-san?

291
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Today, I'm going to check if the pig is cooked.

292
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I'm a big fan of it.

293
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I've been cooking it since last night.

294
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I've been simmering it.

295
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
You've been simmering it?

296
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:21,000
This is a pig called Hanako that I've been keeping for about 15 years.

297
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I see.

298
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
You've been simmering it a lot, haven't you?

299
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
When I call it Hanako, it's always, boom.

300
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
It was cute, Hanako.

301
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Look, the meat is so tender.

302
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
That's Hanako's leg.

303
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I wrapped it around her when she was injured.

304
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Oh, excuse me.

305
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Hanako's ribbon is in it.

306
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Everyone, I'm going to try it.

307
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Hanako.

308
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I wonder what it tastes like.

309
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Boo.

310
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Hanako, boo.

311
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Yoshio, move!

312
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Yoshio, move!

313
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Hanako, give it back!

314
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Hanako, give it back!

315
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Give it to me!

316
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Give it to me!

317
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Hanako, give it to me!

318
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Hanako, give it to me!

319
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Hanako, give it to me!

320
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Hanako, give it to me!

321
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Hanako, move!

322
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Now, I'm going to try it.

323
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Her chest is a bit small.

324
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I'm going to try it.

325
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I'm going to try it.

326
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I'm going to try it.

327
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I'm going to try it.

328
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I'm going to try it.

329
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I'm going to try it.

330
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Well, you've been living in Tokyo, haven't you?

331
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Yes.

332
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Tokyo is a great city, isn't it?

333
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Why?

334
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
You can't get a parking lot.

335
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Oh, that's right.

336
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I'm looking for a parking lot, too.

337
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
There's a mansion, but there's no parking lot.

338
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
And there's no surroundings, right?

339
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
That's right.

340
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
It's completely packed.

341
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
And if you stop for a moment, you'll be transferred to another place right away, right?

342
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Yeah.

343
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I've been thinking about it.

344
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
There's no way for me to get a parking lot, you know.

345
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:36,000
building up one's own Secondary School

346
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:48,000
You can't get a parking lot anymore.

347
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Today is a little different from the previous program.

348
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
That's right.

349
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Please explain a little.

350
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Today, as usual, the story ends, right?

351
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:03,000
We talked a little like a free talk and said goodbye.

352
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Today, I put out a monitor here.

353
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:13,000
In fact, from 7 o'clock on this Japanese TV, from Saturday, every Saturday, from 7 o'clock, everyone laughs.

354
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:19,000
One hour, other than us, B-21, Pink's phone, we are doing various things together.

355
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
In the meantime, wait!

356
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
How many years are you waiting?

357
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
In the meantime, I did a skit.

358
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
That's right.

359
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
So, in terms of time, I didn't fit in this skit.

360
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
The skit that didn't become a comedy show.

361
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
It's a waste, isn't it?

362
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Even though I'm doing my best.

363
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Look at that today.

364
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I'm going to die!

365
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Hey!

366
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
The water won't come out!

367
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Hey.

368
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Someone!

369
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Help me!

370
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
The water won't come out!

371
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Help me.

372
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Someone!

373
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
The water won't come out!

374
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Help me!

375
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
The water won't come out!

376
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Help!

377
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Give me some water!

378
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Who will help me?

379
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Who will help me?

380
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Everyone!

381
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Someone help me!

382
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Everyone!

383
00:16:49,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Someone help me!

384
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Someone help me!

385
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Today's child is the most beautiful among the staff.

386
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Really?

387
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Really?

388
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
It's a little heavy.

389
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Then,

390
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I asked you to bring a postcard instead.

391
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
For example,

392
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I have been doing Osaka dialect lectures recently.

393
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
By the way,

394
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
In Osaka dialect, Hama-chan often says,

395
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Ite-ma-u-do.

396
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
What does it mean?

397
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Are you stupid?

398
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Is it strange?

399
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Is that Ite-ma-u-do?

400
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Is that Ite-ma-u-do?

401
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Ite-ma-u-do.

402
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Ite-ma-u-do means,

403
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Shiba-kudo.

404
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
What is Shiba-kudo?

405
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
What is Shiba-kudo?

406
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
So,

407
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Kamasu-zo.

408
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
What is Kamasu-zo?

409
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
What does Shiba-kudo mean?

410
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Do it properly!

411
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Where do you get the idea of Shiba-kudo from?

412
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Everything!

413
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
If you say Shiba-kudo,

414
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
it means to hit the ground.

415
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I'll hit the ground, too.

416
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
How can you say that?

417
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
How can you say that?

418
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
How can you say that?

419
00:18:48,000 --> 00:19:00,000
It means that you can turn around.

420
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
How can you say that?

421
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
How can you say that?

422
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I'm not ready yet.

423
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
How can you say that?

424
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
So,

425
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
it means that you can do everything,

426
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
including hitting the ground.

427
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
You can do everything!

428
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
You can do everything!

429
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
You can do everything!

430
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
By the way,

431
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
you know Yasu-san from Yokoyama, right?

432
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
His words,

433
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
even in Osaka dialect,

434
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
are quite cruel.

435
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
It's quite weird in terms of grammar.

436
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
It's a special case.

437
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
It's his words.

438
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Yes, yes.

439
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Like,

440
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I'll get angry,

441
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I'll get angry,

442
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
but...

443
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
But what?

444
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I'll get angry,

445
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I'll get angry,

446
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
but...

447
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
but...

448
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
It means that you can do everything.

449
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Yes.

450
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
How can you say that?

451
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I'm not ready yet.

452
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
How can you say that?

453
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
How can you say that?

454
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
He's a cartoon character.

455
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Right?

456
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
He's a cartoon character.

457
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
But if it's normal,

458
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
There's no way I'll get angry.

459
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:01,000
You won't hate

460
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
you won't hate

461
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
when someone said something like that

462
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
At a once,

463
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
you can't say

464
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
but...

465
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
What?

466
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
What?

467
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I can see that part.

468
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
It's really difficult.

469
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
How is it difficult?

470
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
There's a guy in Tokyo called Harutatsu recently.

471
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I've said this before.

472
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
When I'm doing my make-up,

473
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
I sometimes say the opposite.

474
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Then,

475
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
I say,

476
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Laugh! Laugh! Laugh!

477
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
After that,

478
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I say,

479
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:38,000
It might be strange.

480
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Are you laughing now?

481
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Why? Why are you laughing?

482
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
I'm just asking.

483
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
I'm not just saying it.

484
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I'm just saying it.

485
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
I'll be happy if I get it.

486
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
I don't think I'll get it.

487
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
It might be strange.

488
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Laugh! Laugh! Laugh!

489
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
I've said this before.

490
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
In this program,

491
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
we're going to make a present.

492
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
What?

493
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
About two sets.

494
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Huh?

495
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
I think everyone will pull this.

496
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
I'm sure the motor will be happy.

497
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Don't say that.

498
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
I'm sure the motor will be happy.

499
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
What?

500
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
I like it.

501
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
What?

502
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I like it.

503
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
I don't know if you said it once.

504
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Say it twice.

505
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Two sets.

506
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Why two sets?

507
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
My face is written on it.

508
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
It's the best.

509
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
I'm happy if I get it.

510
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Why are you happy?

511
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
I'm happy.

512
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Who's happy?

513
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
What?

514
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Are you happy with the other side?

515
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Or are you happy with the other side?

516
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I don't care.

517
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
It's fashionable.

518
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
My face is written on it.

519
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
If I get it, my face will be bigger.

520
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Laugh! Laugh! Laugh!

521
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Laugh! Laugh! Laugh!

522
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Hello.

523
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Hey.

524
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Hey.

525
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Laugh! Laugh! Laugh!

526
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Good morning, Allen.

527
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
It's over.

528
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
It's over.

529
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Today was your first attempt.

530
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
What?

531
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Showing off your skits.

532
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I think I got a lot.

533
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
How was the assistant?

534
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I was taught the dirtiness of the entertainment world.

535
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
With the assistant?

536
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Yes.

537
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
What?

538
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
I don't know where the good guy went.

539
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Who?

540
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Someone hid the envelope somewhere.

541
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
The guy who sent it?

542
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Yes.

543
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
My manager, Nitta, is secretly keeping it.

544
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
It's funny.

545
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
But it's okay.

546
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Everyone is young.

547
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,000
It's normal for a man and a woman to be in such a relationship.

548
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,000
At that time, you should not wear what you wear.

549
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
For that?

550
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
I like it.

551
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Laugh! Laugh! Laugh!

552
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
A piece of tissue.

553
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
This is it.

554
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
I want to keep it.

555
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
This is a real present.

556
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I think it's good.

557
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
It's good.

558
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Yes.

559
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I'll be a little more smart.

560
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
I'll be a little more smart.

561
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I'll be a little more smart.

562
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
You're a fool.

563
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Laugh! Laugh! Laugh!

564
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
What is it?

565
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
If you can, try it.

566
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I'll use it.

567
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Which one?

568
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
What?

569
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Your face?

570
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
I don't care about your face.

571
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
What?

572
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
I don't care either.

573
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
I don't care about your face.

574
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
But it's pathetic.

575
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
After you go, it's messy.

576
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:20,000
I think you can have sex with a fun atmosphere while laughing.

577
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
That's right.

578
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
It's called Japanese sex.

579
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
What?

580
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
What is this face?

581
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
We laugh together.

582
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
What are you saying?

583
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Laugh! Laugh! Laugh!

584
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
You can think of ideas.

585
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
If you make something like this on the show and send it to me.

586
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Yes.

587
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
I'm thinking about that.

588
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
I'm thinking about that.

589
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,000
This program is brought to you by Oyama International Products,

590
