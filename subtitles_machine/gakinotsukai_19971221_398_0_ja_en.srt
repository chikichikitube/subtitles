00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
In the 1st episode of Gaki no Tsukai, Chikichi, the world's name, Anki Gasshoen, Gaijin-san, welcome!

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Hello.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
This is easy.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Gaijin-san will appear, so you just need to remember their names.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
That's it?

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
That's right.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
The person who remembers the least will be punished.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
This is really simple and clear.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
10 people will appear, right?

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Yes, 10 people will appear.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
That's how it is.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
What about Anki Gasshoen, Yamaaki-san?

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I'm really good at Anki Gasshoen.

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I used to be an old man.

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
When I went to college, I was an old man.

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I was doing all kinds of Anki Gasshoen.

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
If you were good at Anki Gasshoen, you wouldn't be an old man, right?

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
No, but I was an old man.

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
It's not fun at all even if you're a wife.

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Endo Shodo-san.

21
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Nice to meet you.

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
What's your name?

23
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
It's Ganjin-san's name.

24
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Ganjin-san?

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The last one.

26
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Naoki Tanigawa.

27
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Nice to meet you.

28
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Wait a minute.

29
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Your tongue is weird.

30
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I can't talk.

31
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
It's okay.

32
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I can't talk.

33
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Let's do our best.

34
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
10 people will appear.

35
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
After that, we'll randomly choose.

36
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
For example, I remember perfectly.

37
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
For example, Yamazaki-san.

38
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Yes.

39
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I think Endo lost this.

40
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Please name it right away.

41
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
He probably can't say it.

42
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
He can't say it.

43
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
But if Endo-san can say it,

44
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Yamazaki-san, who named it, will lose.

45
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
This is a minus.

46
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I see.

47
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Hana-san, are you okay?

48
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
You're still laughing like this.

49
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
It can't be helped.

50
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I have to do more.

51
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
This program is brought to you by these sponsors.

52
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
The first one.

53
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Go ahead.

54
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Hello.

55
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Hello.

56
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
The first one.

57
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
My name is Mohamed Raju.

58
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Please show us.

59
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
My name is Mohamed Raju.

60
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Mohamed Raju-san.

61
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
It's okay.

62
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
It's okay.

63
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I'm okay.

64
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I'm okay.

65
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Let's go.

66
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
The next one.

67
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Hello.

68
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Hello.

69
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
My name is Edmond Bridgewater.

70
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
It sounds like a name with a lot of words.

71
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Edmond Bridgewater-san.

72
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Okay.

73
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Are you ready?

74
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Let's go.

75
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Hello.

76
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Hello.

77
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
That's good.

78
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
My name is Rainford Reed.

79
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Rainford Reed-san.

80
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
That was good.

81
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Is it okay if I ask you questions?

82
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Are you wearing sunglasses?

83
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I took them off.

84
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
They have nothing to do with me.

85
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
That was a terrible interruption.

86
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Can I ask you something?

87
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
How do you pronounce my name?

88
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
We can't understand Japanese.

89
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
We can't ask questions.

90
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I want you to have a good time.

91
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
My name is Mohamed Saad Kisra.

92
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Mohamed Saad Kisra.

93
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
My name is Moni Hoshin.

94
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
This is good.

95
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Moni Hoshin.

96
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
My name is Bernard Edrington.

97
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Edrington.

98
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Edrington.

99
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Bernard Edrington.

100
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
My name is Joe.

101
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
What's your name?

102
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I don't remember your name.

103
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
My name is Hasein.

104
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I don't remember your name.

105
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I'm from Indonesia.

106
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Thank you very much.

107
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Thank you very much.

108
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Next person, please.

109
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Hello. Hello.

110
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
My name is Mishiwaki Twimasebe.

111
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Mishiwaki Twimasebe.

112
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
If you remember, the one on top is Nishiwaki.

113
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Mishiwaki Twimasebe.

114
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I remember.

115
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
That's good.

116
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
This is the last one.

117
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
The 10th person is this person.

118
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Hello. Hello.

119
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
My name is Ahmed Griev.

120
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
What?

121
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Ahmed Griev.

122
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Griev.

123
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
It's a difficult name.

124
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
It's a difficult name.

125
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
It's a difficult person.

126
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
It's like a nickname.

127
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Is there a nickname like that?

128
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Ahmed. Ahmed.

129
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
All of them seem to be difficult names to remember.

130
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Who is the one who has forgotten the name of a foreigner in Yamazaki Kokoriko?

131
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
First of all, this person.

132
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Hello. Hello.

133
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Yamazaki-san.

134
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Yes.

135
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Are you okay?

136
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I'm okay.

137
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Endo-san.

138
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I'm okay.

139
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Takakawa-san.

140
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I'm okay.

141
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Takakawa-san, do you think you remember the other two?

142
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Yamazaki-san has lost his sight.

143
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Yamazaki-san.

144
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
He has lost his sight.

145
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
He has lost his sight.

146
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Yamazaki-san.

147
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Edward Bridget Water.

148
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
What is it?

149
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Edward Bridge...

150
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Bridge Water.

151
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Is this correct?

152
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Yes, it's correct.

153
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I think both of you are incorrect.

154
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
It's Edward Bridge Water.

155
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Oh, Endo-san.

156
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Edmont Bridge Water.

157
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
That's correct.

158
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
That's amazing.

159
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
That's correct.

160
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
This person.

161
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Hello. Hello.

162
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Yes, Yamazaki-san.

163
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I'm Endo Music.

164
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Endo-san, are you okay?

165
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Yes, I'm okay.

166
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Then please call his name.

167
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Edward Water-san.

168
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Hello. Hello.

169
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Yes, yes, yes.

170
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Then, Endo-san.

171
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Tanaka-kun.

172
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I think he has lost his sight.

173
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I see.

174
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Wait a minute.

175
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I'm sure he has lost his sight.

176
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
The reason why they raised their hands like that is probably because they don't know each other.

177
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Tanaka-san, please call his name.

178
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Mohammed Saad Kisra-san.

179
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
That's correct.

180
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
That's amazing.

181
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
That's correct.

182
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Endo-san, it's your turn.

183
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Oh, it hurts.

184
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Kiyo Sebak-san.

185
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
It's the same as mine.

186
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Mohammed Raz-san.

187
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
That's correct.

188
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Let's go.

189
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
This person.

190
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Hello. Hello.

191
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Hello.

192
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Yamazaki-san.

193
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Endo-san, please call his name.

194
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Then please call his name.

195
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Let's go.

196
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Cornelius Savanna-san.

197
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I think he has lost his sight.

198
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
But like Endo-san, he has the spirit to say something even if he doesn't remember anything.

199
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
That's what Kin-chan likes.

200
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Hello. Hello.

201
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Where did you get this from?

202
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
No, no, no.

203
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Tanaka-san, it's your turn.

204
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Endo-san, please call his name.

205
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Andreda Giant-san.

206
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
No, no, no.

207
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
There wasn't a second one, right?

208
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I don't get it at all.

209
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Is it possible to reverse the last one?

210
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Of course, it is.

211
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
It is?

212
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Wait a minute.

213
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Why is it of course?

214
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
If you don't get the next one right, you get 4 points.

215
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
4 minus.

216
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
The last one is this person.

217
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Hello. Hello.

218
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
What kind of actor is this?

219
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I really know this person. I really know this person.

220
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I think everyone knows this person.

221
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I see, I see.

222
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Endo has no chance of winning if he doesn't say anything.

223
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
That's right.

224
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Yes.

225
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Yes, Endo-san.

226
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Yes, Endo-san.

227
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I wonder if Tanaka-kun knows this person.

228
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Tanaka-kun.

229
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I think he has lost sight of it.

230
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
If Tanaka-san doesn't get it right, it's a reverse.

231
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Then, Tanaka-san.

232
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
What is the name of this person?

233
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Griez.

234
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
He did it.

235
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Really?

236
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
He did it.

237
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
No.

238
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Kase-no-san.

239
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
What was Kase-no-san?

240
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Then, Kase-no-san.

241
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Kase-no-san.

242
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I remember Serano.

243
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Serano.

244
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Serano.

245
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
The punishment game is Tanaka-san.

246
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Tanaka-san.

247
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
As a result of the name test, the punishment game will be decided by these 8 people.

248
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Please take these 8 people home for the night.

249
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
A night spent with foreigners. The punishment game will be in the second half of the program.

250
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Ladies and gentlemen.

251
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I'm grateful that you're cheering for me like this.

252
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
But I don't know if I can respond to this cheering.

253
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
We are.

254
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
We are.

255
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I'm sorry that I'm not feeling well.

256
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Are you okay?

257
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I have dry skin.

258
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I can't help but scratch my body.

259
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Are you okay?

260
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I've been living here for more than 30 years.

261
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I have a lot of phlegm.

262
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Why do you say that?

263
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
If a person has phlegm once,

264
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
If a normal person has experienced phlegm 20,000 times,

265
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I think I have a lot of phlegm.

266
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
That's because you happen to have phlegm at this time of the year.

267
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
No, no.

268
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
If you say you have phlegm, I have phlegm too.

269
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I have phlegm.

270
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I always have phlegm.

271
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Wait a minute.

272
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Do you always have phlegm?

273
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I always have phlegm.

274
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Really?

275
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I still have phlegm.

276
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I always have phlegm.

277
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I have a little bit of phlegm.

278
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
That's how it is.

279
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I see.

280
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
It's Christmas.

281
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Christmas.

282
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Do you buy something for your children?

283
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Is it a gift?

284
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I don't know what to say about children.

285
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
It's a child.

286
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
It's not a child, it's a child.

287
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
If you have a family, there are times like that.

288
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Don't you give anyone a Christmas present?

289
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
What is it?

290
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
A Christmas present.

291
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I'll give it to you.

292
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Really?

293
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Yes.

294
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
To whom?

295
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
After all,

296
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
To my girlfriend.

297
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Well, I promised her in the future.

298
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I promised her that I would run away with her hand in my hand.

299
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
That's enough.

300
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Why are you running away?

301
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
What are you going to give her?

302
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Well, I'm wondering what I'm going to give her this year.

303
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Do you have anything good?

304
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
No, I've given her the same thing as before.

305
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Well, I gave her a ring.

306
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
A gold ring?

307
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Wait a minute.

308
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
What?

309
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
What is it?

310
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
What is it?

311
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Do you have it?

312
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Do you have it?

313
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Yes, I have it.

314
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
It's not expensive.

315
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
If you give her something expensive, she'll become a star like me.

316
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:12,000
People often say that a diamond or a wedding ring is worth a few months.

317
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Of course, there may be something like that.

318
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I want to give her a diamond that is as bright as me.

319
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
A blue ring?

320
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
That's right.

321
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
There's a blue ring here.

322
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I want to give her a ring that is as bright as me.

323
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
A blue ring?

324
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
A ring?

325
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
What kind of ring are you talking about?

326
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
A ring?

327
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
You didn't know?

328
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,000
What ordinary citizens buy is a ring.

329
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
A ring?

330
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
From a certain point, she'll become a character.

331
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
A character?

332
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
She'll become a character.

333
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
A character.

334
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
A character?

335
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
She'll become a character letter.

336
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I want to give her 30 character letters.

337
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
That sounds amazing.

338
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Yes, it's amazing.

339
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Is it big?

340
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Yes, it's big.

341
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
It's a special order.

342
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
She'll eat noodles.

343
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,000
If you think it's a lie, you can go to a jewelry store and ask for 30 character letters.

344
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
If you ask for 30 character letters, she'll eat noodles.

345
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
She'll eat noodles.

346
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
She'll eat noodles.

347
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
She'll eat noodles.

348
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
What about this year?

349
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
This year, I want to give her a wine opener.

350
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I want to give her a cork.

351
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I want to give her two of those.

352
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
For me.

353
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
It has nothing to do with you.

354
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
You want to give her two?

355
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Yes, a cork.

356
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
A cork and a wine opener.

357
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
That's it.

358
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
That's it.

359
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
What are you?

360
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
You can't do it for your wife?

361
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:16,000
If you have time.

362
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
If you have time.

363
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Time?

364
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
It's almost like my birthday.

365
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,000
It's not because it's Christmas.

366
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
It's not because it's Christmas.

367
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:36,000
You're thinking it's okay to be shy, right?

368
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
That's what I'm thinking.

369
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
You're thinking it's okay to be shy, right?

370
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
My question to you, Masumoto-san.

371
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
You were working at a place where the bowling pins were coming out.

372
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
What exactly were you doing inside?

373
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Also, what happened inside?

374
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I worked part-time really hard.

375
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
How many did you do?

376
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I don't really remember working part-time.

377
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I'm sure you can tell from the way we're talking, but we have a different life experience.

378
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
It's like the thickness of a man's chest.

379
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
It's so thin.

380
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
We do a lot of things.

381
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Is this one of those things?

382
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
The bowling thing. I did it.

383
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
What were you doing in there?

384
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
There's a triangle with a hole in it.

385
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:36,000
You put a pin in there and go gaga gaga gaga gaga.

386
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Do you have that much time?

387
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
If you break it, it'll just fall off.

388
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
At that time, you drop it like gaga gaga gaga gaga.

389
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
This is 200 yen for a time machine.

390
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
200 yen for a time machine?

391
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I also did the ball-pulling thing.

392
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
You pull out the ball?

393
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
There's a place where the ball comes out.

394
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
It's spinning, isn't it?

395
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

396
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
It's spinning down there.

397
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
If you pull out a little more, you can see it.

398
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
It's spinning like this.

399
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
That's a difficult way to do it.

400
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
And when the ball comes, it goes like this.

401
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
You can't get your hand out?

402
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
You can't get your hand out.

403
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
You have to train it first.

404
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
And when the ball comes, it goes like this.

405
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
When it comes out, the air is here.

406
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
It goes in and out.

407
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Look at how it moves.

408
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Like this?

409
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Yeah, yeah.

410
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
This time machine is 800 yen.

411
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
That's too cheap!

412
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
This one is cheaper.

413
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
That was a lot of work.

414
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
You did a lot of things.

415
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
You did the ball-pulling thing.

416
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
The ball-pulling thing?

417
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Yeah, the ball-pulling thing.

418
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Oh, the ball-pulling thing?

419
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Yeah, the ball-pulling thing.

420
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
What?

421
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
You mean the stainless steel thing?

422
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
That's a lot of work.

423
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
You're always talking about the ball-pulling thing.

424
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Recently, many banks and securities companies have gone bankrupt.

425
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:24,000
From now on, please find a way to keep your money safe.

426
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I don't know what's going to happen even if I leave it in the bank.

427
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Who would do that?

428
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
It used to be safe a long time ago.

429
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,000
But the bank says it's going to collapse.

430
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Who would do that?

431
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
It's accumulated.

432
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Let's protect our money.

433
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
This is a spear.

434
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
We have to protect it with a spear.

435
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

436
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

437
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
It hurts.

438
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
You took the gum, didn't you?

439
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I didn't take the gum.

440
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I didn't take it.

441
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
You always come.

442
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
You always do the ball-pulling thing.

443
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
You have to protect your money.

444
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:17,000
What are you guys doing?

445
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
How do you protect your money?

446
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Why can't you guys talk?

447
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Go home.

448
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Die. Go home and die.

449
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I'm being told to go home and die.

450
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
What?

451
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Drink two different kinds of cold medicine and die.

452
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
What's that?

453
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I don't know.

454
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
What?

455
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
What?

456
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
In a way, you're worse than Yamasaki.

457
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Why are you so angry?

458
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I have a document on this show.

459
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
You read it and I'll answer it.

460
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Really?

461
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
That's right.

462
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Answer it properly.

463
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
You're being told to protect it with a spear.

464
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
What's wrong with that?

465
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
If you die, you die.

466
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
You'll be stuck in a compressor.

467
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
A compressor?

468
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
You'll be stuck in a compressor.

469
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
What's wrong with you?

470
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
What's wrong with you?

471
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
What's wrong with you?

472
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
You, you, you, you, you.

473
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
You're a little smart.

474
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Just a while ago, I turned on the TV.

475
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Oh, really?

476
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I turned it on because the show was about to start.

477
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Why did you turn it off?

478
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
What's wrong with you?

479
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
What's wrong with you?

480
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
What's wrong with you?

481
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
What's wrong with you?

482
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
What's wrong with you?

483
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
What's wrong with you?

484
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
What's wrong with you?

485
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Die. Die.

486
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,000
If you have a lot of business cards, you'll have a lot of business cards.

487
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
That's not business card.

488
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I'm trying to say something for people here.

489
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
That's right.

490
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
It's a good thing if you listen to it and accept it.

491
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
We have to reflect on it.

492
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
I'm sorry to apologize to everyone.

493
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I'm really sorry.

494
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Okay, okay, okay.

495
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Bring me a hammer.

496
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Why?

497
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
It's okay.

498
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I don't need it.

499
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
You don't need it?

500
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Please.

501
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Okay, I got it.

502
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Yutaro.

503
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Please.

504
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Money.

505
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Stop talking.

506
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
If that's the case, I can't sell it.

507
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Please.

508
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
You guys are really stupid.

509
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
I'm stupid.

510
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I'm sorry.

511
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Okay, okay.

512
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
How to protect your own money.

513
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
That's right.

514
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
That means you can't leave it in the bank.

515
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
That's the current situation.

516
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Let's get rid of it. Let's get rid of all the savings.

517
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Let's get rid of all the savings.

518
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Let's get rid of all the savings.

519
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
And let's put money in your own house.

520
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Let's put money in my own house.

521
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
There's a thing called stealing.

522
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
There's a thing called money laundering.

523
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
It's dangerous.

524
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
It's because you go on a trip.

525
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Don't say things you don't need.

526
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Don't say things you don't need.

527
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
How to protect.

528
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
How to protect is the best thing.

529
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
That's the point of today's talk.

530
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
That's the point.

531
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
How to protect.

532
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
How to protect.

533
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
For example, put it on your desk.

534
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Right?

535
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Put it on your desk?

536
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
For example, Yutan.

537
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
That's not it.

538
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I'm sorry.

539
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
That's right.

540
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
That's right.

541
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
I'm usually like, put it somewhere.

542
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
That's what I'm talking about.

543
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
How far are you going?

544
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
How far are you going?

545
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
I want to walk along the road.

546
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
What is it?

547
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Do you want to go home?

548
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
You're so harsh.

549
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Let's go home.

550
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
I'm sorry.

551
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I don't have money.

552
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
You're not resisting, are you?

553
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Wait a minute.

554
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Wait a minute.

555
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Wait a minute.

556
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
You're so easy-going.

557
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Wait a minute.

558
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Wait a minute.

559
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
You know what?

560
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
If he tells you to go home...

561
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
I've been holding out my hand all this time.

562
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
I want to stay here and do it.

563
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
If he tells you to go home, you won't listen to me.

564
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
I wonder if I can get in.

565
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
What is it?

566
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000

No shoes.

572
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
No shoes.

No shoes.

00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Put it in the room.

584
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Put it in the room.

Listen to me.
