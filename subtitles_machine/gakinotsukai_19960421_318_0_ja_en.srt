1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
It's time for the 1st Gaki no Tsukai Arahen, Chikitsuki Gendo Kai Babanuki Senchiken!

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
It's been a long time.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
It's been a long time since we've had an opening like this.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
It's nice.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Today, Yamagata-san will be in charge, so we haven't been told anything.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Yes. Today, we're going to have the Gendo Kai Babanuki Senchiken.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Did you say it?

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Yes, I did.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Did I say it out loud?

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Yes. From now on, there will be 31 pictures of the celebrities on the cards.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Ah, so each of them will be given out.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Yes, each of them will be given out to two people.

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Yes.

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Then, based on the capacity of the Babanuki Senchiken, one will be taken out one by one.

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Yes, yes.

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Then, the celebrities with the same common interest will be shown here.

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I see.

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Do you understand?

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Yes, yes.

20
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
And if they really have the same common interest, they will be called Babanuki Senchiken.

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
So, the big treasure will be taken out.

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Yes, it will be taken out.

23
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
It will be taken out.

24
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Then, there will be one left, right?

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Yes, yes.

26
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
That person will be the Babanuki of the entertainment world.

27
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I see.

28
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
That's how it is.

29
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
That's right.

30
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
He's not the Babanuki, though.

31
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
This person is not needed in the entertainment world.

32
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
No, he's not needed.

33
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
That's your interpretation.

34
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
That means he doesn't belong here.

35
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
He doesn't belong here.

36
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Why does this person have a grudge against the entertainment world?

37
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
It's forced.

38
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
It's forced.

39
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
It's forced.

40
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
It's forced.

41
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
It's forced.

42
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
This program is brought to you by the following sponsors.

43
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Please take a look, me?

44
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Of course, take a look.

45
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Have a look, please.

46
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Please take a look, one after the other.

47
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Stiff.

48
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Stiff.

49
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
There's a whole lot that you dislike.

50
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I'm just not good.

51
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
There's a whole lot of stuff you don't like about me.

52
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm wasn't.

53
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I can be properly êµ¿ on the stage.

54
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Yes, go ahead.

55
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I don't like this game.

56
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I'm having a lot of fun too.

57
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
It's not fun at all.

58
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I'm having a lot of fun.

59
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Everyone used to sit like this a long time ago.

60
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
You drew a good one.

61
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
You drew a good one.

62
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
In a way, he's an idiot.

63
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
You drew a good one.

64
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Did you find it?

65
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Yes, I found it.

66
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
This is...

67
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
What?

68
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Hamada Masatoshi appeared.

69
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
What do you mean?

70
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
It's hard to wrinkle.

71
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Safe!

72
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I wrinkled!

73
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
It's very safe.

74
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
You're an idiot.

75
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
You're an idiot.

76
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
That's right.

77
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
We do our best to wrinkle.

78
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Because it's a game.

79
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Here it is.

80
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
This.

81
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Here it is.

82
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
What is it?

83
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Oh!

84
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Okay!

85
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Let's go.

86
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Please draw a good one.

87
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Okay.

88
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
You drew a good one.

89
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Did you draw the best one?

90
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
You drew a good one.

91
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
You drew a good one.

92
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
But in my hands...

93
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
There's no one who can transform.

94
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
This is not good.

95
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
It's easy to understand.

96
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
It's easy to understand.

97
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
It's not common.

98
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
It's supposed to be like this.

99
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Okay.

100
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I want to say something good.

101
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
It's true.

102
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
There's nothing good.

103
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
It's hard.

104
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
This is...

105
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Hinagata Akiko.

106
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Here it is.

107
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Matsumoto Hitoshi.

108
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
What does this mean?

109
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
It's supposed to be like this.

110
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Ukeuchi.

111
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Shakure.

112
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Here it is.

113
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
You drew a good one.

114
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Matsumoto Hitoshi.

115
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
You drew a good one.

116
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Nagabuchi Tsuyoshi.

117
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I remembered a good one.

118
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Here it is.

119
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Matsuyama Chiharu.

120
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
What does this mean?

121
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
This is...

122
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Please judge.

123
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Shut up!

124
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I don't know.

125
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
What is this?

126
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
What should I say?

127
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
This is good.

128
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Mokkun.

129
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Both of them are handsome.

130
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I would definitely do that.

131
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I would definitely do that.

132
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Shut up!

133
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I would definitely do that.

134
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Moriwaki.

135
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
A character who is loved from young to old.

136
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Please do it.

137
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
This is a great battle.

138
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Really?

139
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Here it is.

140
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
This is it.

141
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Safe!

142
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
This is a big safe.

143
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
This is a big safe.

144
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Please draw.

145
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
This is bad.

146
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
This is bad.

147
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Wajima Sensei.

148
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Sensei?

149
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Why Sensei?

150
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Moriwaki Kenji.

151
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
That was easy.

152
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
That was easy.

153
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
That was easy.

154
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Fujita Tomoko.

155
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Please put it down.

156
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
That was it?

157
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
That was it?

158
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I don't think so.

159
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
No, no, no.

160
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
There is no problem.

161
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
There is no problem.

162
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Drink it.

163
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Drink it.

164
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Who will it be?

165
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Who will it be?

166
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
There is a problem with your hair.

167
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Safe!

168
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Safe!

169
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Safe!

170
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Safe!

171
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
What a great combination.

172
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
My old lady!

173
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Old lady!

174
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
It was something inside of my head.

175
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I see.

176
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
That's what it means.

177
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
That's right.

178
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
It is a great opportunity.

179
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
It is a great opportunity.

180
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Do you want to do it?

181
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I can't do it.

182
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I can't.

183
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I'm not that kind of guy.

184
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I'll do it if it's easy to get on.

185
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I'll do it if it's easy to get on.

186
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I'll do it if it's easy to get on.

187
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Easy to get on.

188
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Wait a minute.

189
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
What is it?

190
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
This is interesting.

191
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
It's been a while.

192
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
It's been a while.

193
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I'm not that kind of guy.

194
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Hello.

195
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
It's been a while.

196
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
It's been a while.

197
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
It's a nice place.

198
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Is it nice?

199
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
If you look at this.

200
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
You're not motivated.

201
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
You're not motivated.

202
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I'm not motivated.

203
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I'm not motivated.

204
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
You're not motivated.

205
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
You're not motivated.

206
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
You're not motivated.

207
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I'm not motivated.

208
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Hey.

209
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
What was it?

210
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
It's okay.

211
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Why is it okay?

212
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I was about to forget.

213
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
No, no, no.

214
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Somehow, you two are getting along badly.

215
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Are you showing that shit again?

216
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
It's often written in magazines

217
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
When I put it in my decree

218
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,000
It's a disgusting piece of shit.

219
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I understand.

220
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
It's terrible.

221
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I'm a really unpleasant group.

222
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
And you, you know,

223
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I said too much.

224
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Wait a minute.

225
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
You've become a mess.

226
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
It was too much.

227
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
And Hamada, you know, I was too much in his eyes.

228
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I didn't say it.

229
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I said it.

230
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I said, you're such a fool!

231
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Why did you get caught?

232
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
And we got along.

233
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,000
The reason we got along was because I was the one who was bad.

234
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
And you were always following me around.

235
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
It was like you were tired.

236
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Yeah, I was tired.

237
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
That's why when I came out, it was like this.

238
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
The other day, you were doing it like this.

239
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I thought it was terrible.

240
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
No, it's not that.

241
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
It's because you didn't say it properly.

242
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
What are you talking about?

243
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
You didn't say that there was no such thing.

244
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I didn't say anything.

245
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Because I was told.

246
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
100,000 yen, 50,000 yen.

247
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
What?

248
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
You didn't say that.

249
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
What are you talking about?

250
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
You didn't say that there was no such thing.

251
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
You didn't say that.

252
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
You didn't say that.

253
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
You're always like this.

254
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
No, no, no.

255
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Let's do it again.

256
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Earlier, you said it in the dressing room.

257
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Really, how many years have I been doing this?

258
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
What?

259
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
How many years have you been doing this?

260
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
How many years have I been doing this in this world?

261
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
15 years.

262
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
It's been 15 years.

263
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I've been doing this for 15 years.

264
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I've never complained to the AD or the staff.

265
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
That's not true.

266
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
That's not true.

267
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
You're like Kodama-san.

268
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
That's not true.

269
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
That's not true.

270
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I've never complained to the AD.

271
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I've never complained to the AD.

272
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Let me tell you this.

273
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
If there's a mistake with the AD,

274
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
if complaining is love,

275
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
then maybe there's no love.

276
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Wait.

277
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Wait, wait.

278
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I'm not that kind of person.

279
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I'm not that kind of person.

280
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Right?

281
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
That's not true.

282
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Why?

283
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I've never complained to the AD.

284
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
That's not true.

285
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I've never complained to the staff.

286
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I've never complained to the staff.

287
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
It's hard to complain.

288
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
It's hard to complain.

289
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
That's not true.

290
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I don't want people to think I'm a good person.

291
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I'm not a good person at all.

292
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
That's true.

293
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I do my best to make people laugh.

294
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
But I don't like people who are bad at lying.

295
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
What?

296
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
For example,

297
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
in Downtown Deluxe,

298
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
there's a poll of 1,000 people, right?

299
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Yes, yes.

300
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Out of all the talented people,

301
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
this guy is in 5th place.

302
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
4th place.

303
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
He's in 4th place.

304
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
But out of the 1,000 people, he's in 1st place.

305
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
He was in 1st place.

306
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
He was in 1st place.

307
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
He's a villainous talent.

308
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
That's why.

309
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Please stop it.

310
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I might not be able to say I'm a good person or a bad person.

311
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
But,

312
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
but,

313
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I'm not.

314
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I'm not that kind of person.

315
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I'm a great old man.

316
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
That's not true.

317
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
That's not true, old man.

318
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Why not?

319
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Downtown Deluxe...

320
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
This makes me angry.

321
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Listen to me.

322
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Downtown Deluxe bullying.

323
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
There's a poll like this.

324
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
There's a picture on the side of the poll.

325
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:03,000
This is my picture.

326
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
We're walking together.

327
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
We're walking together.

328
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:26,000
We're riding the same bullet train together.

329
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
This is strange.

330
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
That's strange.

331
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Why?

332
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
That's strange.

333
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:49,000
It's okay to take a picture of me, but it's okay to take a picture of a normal person.

334
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
That's strange.

335
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
It's like that.

336
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
That's a bad choice.

337
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
That's right.

338
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,000
So it's okay to be a bad person with two people.

339
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Okay.

340
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Okay.

341
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Okay?

342
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
You have to treat me like that.

343
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I feel that way.

344
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
What?

345
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I'm really sorry.

346
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Ah, you scared me!

347
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Don't be scared.

348
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
You look like you're the one who's calling the staff and saying,

349
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Hey!

350
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
You look like you're doing it.

351
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I see.

352
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I've never hit anyone since high school.

353
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I don't know anything about that.

354
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I don't know anything about that.

355
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I've never hit anyone.

356
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
No, it's not that.

357
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
You do this kind of thing at work, right?

358
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Yeah.

359
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
It's nothing more than that.

360
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
No way.

361
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
You're being ridiculous.

362
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I'm not.

363
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Say something!

364
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
What do you want me to say?

365
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Last week, after Kangaroo, you twisted your neck, right?

366
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I didn't do anything.

367
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Why did I twist my neck?

368
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I don't know.

369
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Everyone was calling the staff.

370
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Why did you do that?

371
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Kangaroo, you twisted your neck!

372
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
You twisted your neck.

373
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
But the staff didn't see it.

374
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I can't believe it.

375
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Oh, I remember.

376
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
There's a pachinko, right?

377
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Our?

378
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Our downtown theater.

379
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
This makes me angry again.

380
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Why?

381
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Your pachinko is too thick!

382
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Right?

383
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I don't know if I did it or not,

384
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
but Hamada's pachinko is too thick!

385
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I always get in the way.

386
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Please don't do that.

387
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
It's not good for my image.

388
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
You don't care about your image.

389
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Yesterday, when I was eating at this restaurant,

390
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
you said,

391
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Hamada is often on the show, but you don't come.

392
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Even if you say that...

393
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I don't care.

394
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I made it like that.

395
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Why am I always on the side that gets in the way?

396
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Please don't do that.

397
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I'm glad.

398
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I came out properly.

399
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I'm glad you said that.

400
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I didn't do anything wrong.

401
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
But you have to apologize.

402
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I have to apologize.

403
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I can't read it.

404
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I can't read it.

405
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Hey, hey, hey.

406
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Hey, hey, hey.

407
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Hey, hey.

408
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I always get in the way.

409
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I didn't get in the way.

410
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
You're elegant.

411
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I don't care.

412
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
It's funny, so it's okay.

413
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
It's not funny.

414
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Don't worry about it.

415
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Give me your hand.

416
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Look at this guy.

417
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Get out of the way.

418
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
You're laughing behind my back, too.

419
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Love professional Matsumoto-san.

420
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I'm wearing glasses.

421
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I'm always worried when I kiss.

422
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
What?

423
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I'm going to kiss you.

424
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:28,000
There's no way for a woman to take off her glasses while she's in the mood.

425
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Take off your glasses and kiss me.

426
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Let's talk in the dressing room.

427
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I'm wearing glasses.

428
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I can kiss you lightly.

429
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,000
It's hard to kiss when I'm wearing glasses.

430
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
That's why...

431
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
It's obvious.

432
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
It's obvious, but it's very natural.

433
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:58,000
For example, when you're having sex, you take a bath, right?

434
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
When you take a bath, you take off your glasses.

435
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Of course.

436
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,000
You take a shower and take off your glasses.

437
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Why do you have to wear glasses?

438
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I don't know where my girlfriend is.

439
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
She's a new girl.

440
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I can't wear glasses yet.

441
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Why do you always wear glasses?

442
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Why do you always wear glasses?

443
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,000
When I take my girlfriend to the dressing room, I wear glasses.

444
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Otherwise, I'll hit the wall.

445
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I don't have a girlfriend like that.

446
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I don't know how to drink.

447
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
That's why you have to wear glasses.

448
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I'll hit the wall.

449
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I take off my glasses.

450
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Of course, I take off my glasses at that time.

451
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
But it's hard to take off my glasses at that time.

452
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I don't know how to take off my glasses.

453
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
It hurts.

454
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I don't know how to take off my glasses.

455
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
In the past, there was an actor named Kenta Oka.

456
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
He was wearing glasses.

457
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
He was wearing glasses.

458
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
He was wearing glasses.

459
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
He was wearing glasses in the morning.

460
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
He was wearing glasses.

461
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
That's cheating.

462
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
You can see it even if you don't wear glasses.

463
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,000
It's annoying that you can't concentrate.

464
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
It's annoying that you have to do this all the time.

465
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
My father is doing this, but I'm doing this.

466
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
There are also women who wear glasses.

467
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
There are also couples who wear glasses.

468
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I win! I win!

469
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I wonder if men take off their glasses.

470
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
You're kind.

471
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:02,000
But I let them lie down and take them off.

472
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
That's where it starts.

473
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
That's right.

474
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Otherwise, if you take off your glasses before you take off your female glasses, you won't be able to see your female glasses.

475
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Youkihi, Cleopatra, and Ononokomachi are the three most beautiful women in the world.

476
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Matsumoto, who are the three most beautiful men in the world?

477
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Who are the three most beautiful men in the world?

478
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
What do you think of beautiful men?

479
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
What do you think of beautiful men?

480
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:37,000
If you think about the world, the first thing you can't get rid of is Alain Delon.

481
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
I see.

482
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Next is America.

483
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Who is America?

484
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
That's it.

485
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Ah, John Lone!

486
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
I'm not in America.

487
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Alain Delon, John Lone...

488
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
You like Alain Delon, don't you?

489
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Next is Kato Goh.

490
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Among you, Kato Goh is definitely the most beautiful.

491
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:13,000
The fact that your male image is Kato Goh is...

492
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I can't throw away these three.

493
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
The Japanese representative is Kato Goh.

494
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Wait, wait, wait.

495
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Who is the most handsome man in Japan?

496
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Kato Goh, and then there's Tani Hayato.

497
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
What is it?

498
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
What is it?

499
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
What's so funny?

500
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
No, no, I can't say it's ugly.

501
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Who is it?

502
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Who is the most handsome man in Japan?

503
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Who is the most handsome man in Japan?

504
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:47,000
In the world, it's said that it's Kimura Takuya.

505
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Yes, yes.

506
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Who is it?

507
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Among you, Kato Goh is more handsome than Takuya.

508
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
That's true.

509
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
He has a beautiful face.

510
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
It's a big face, isn't it?

511
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Kato Goh.

512
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
The price doesn't matter.

513
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
But it's a big face.

514
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
I've seen it at the supermarket.

515
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Whether it's big or small, it doesn't matter.

516
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
It's the last box of your underwear.

517
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:23,000
It's hard to tell if it's big or small.

518
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
It's big, so it doesn't matter.

519
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Don't look at me like I'm a sub.

520
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Who is the most handsome man in Japan?

521
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:38,000
I'm doing it with you, but Sorimachi is the most handsome man.

522
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,000
No, it's not Sorimachi.

523
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:47,000
It's Sorimachi.

524
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,000
He's 33 years old.

525
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
He's still 22 or 23 years old.

526
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
His skin is smooth.

527
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,000
He's as chubby as us.

528
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Bring Sorimachi here.

529
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
I'll bring Kato Goh.

530
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:14,000
What kind of connection do you have with him?

531
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Team Zero.

532
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Hey, Team Zero.

533
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Your eyes are long.

534
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Okay, pull it out.

535
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Okay, Shinobu.

536
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,000
This is dirty.

537
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Okay.

538
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Pull it out.

539
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Oh, this is...

540
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Ichihara-san.

541
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
This is it.

542
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Who is the most nutritious?

543
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Yes.

544
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Why?

545
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:06,000
I'm looking forward to it.

546
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:29,000
