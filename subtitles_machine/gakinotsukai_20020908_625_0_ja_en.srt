1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Next time on Gachi no Tsukai Ara! Chikitsuki! Fukawa Ryoshichi Hengen!

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
This is amazing!

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
This is amazing, isn't it?

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Fukawa!

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
The five of you are here!

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Nice to meet you!

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
In the past, our talent and staff...

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Well, most of them.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
They came from other places, right?

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Yes, so really...

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I don't know what to say about myself.

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Why?

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
As a comedian, I wanted to do what I had to do to get here.

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I wanted to throw everything away to get here.

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
But it takes years.

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
That's right.

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I've been watching him for a few years, and I thought,

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
this kid can't do what he has to do.

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
This is the current score.

20
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Yes.

21
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Where should we go today?

22
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Well, for now...

23
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I want to be in the top 10.

24
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
He doesn't seem very confident.

25
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Before that, can you introduce the one who has changed his position?

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Really?

27
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
This is probably the first time he's been on TV.

28
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
If you don't introduce him earlier, his eyes will be different.

29
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
That's right.

30
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
This is my brother.

31
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
See?

32
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Fuka, don't do it like this.

33
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
This program is brought to you by the following sponsors.

34
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
What should we do?

35
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
What should we do?

36
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
But Hamada-san has also changed his position.

37
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Yes, I've changed my position.

38
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
You've changed your position.

39
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Endo, you've also changed your position.

40
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I'm not aware of changing my position.

41
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
What do you think about Endo's head position?

42
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I've changed my position.

43
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I've changed my position.

44
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I've changed my position.

45
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I want to make it short.

46
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I'll stop.

47
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I'll stop.

48
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I've been caught many times.

49
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
What?

50
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Speak properly.

51
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Has Kanaka-san changed his position?

52
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Yes, he has.

53
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
You are really...

54
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
He has become straight.

55
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Yes, he has grown.

56
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Speak properly.

57
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Kanaka has become neutral.

58
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Really?

59
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Yes.

60
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
He is 50 years old.

61
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
He is close.

62
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Let's decide on the movie.

63
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I can't say it.

64
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Yes, you can't say it.

65
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
What is it?

66
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
What is it?

67
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Let's do it.

68
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
What is it?

69
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:08,000
What is it?

70
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
What is it?

71
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
What are you doing?

72
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,000
It took me a long time to change my clothes.

73
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
But when I came back, they were normal clothes.

74
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I just changed my clothes.

75
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
It was just a normal pose.

76
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
You can do it even if you change your clothes, right?

77
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
You have a car, right?

78
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I don't have a car.

79
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I'll go to the back seat.

80
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Sushi.

81
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Sushi.

82
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Tuna.

83
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Tuna.

84
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Tuna.

85
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Tuna.

86
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Shrimp.

87
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Is this okay?

88
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I'm sorry.

89
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I'm sorry.

90
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I'm sorry.

91
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
The clay and the shelf were dangerous.

92
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I was attacked from a distance.

93
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I don't know if I'm scared.

94
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I was attacked from a distance.

95
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Maybe it's because we're close.

96
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I was attacked from a distance.

97
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
It's amazing.

98
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Thank you.

99
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I ate a lot.

100
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I'm sorry.

101
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I don't know what happened.

102
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Have you decided on the meeting?

103
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Have you decided on the project?

104
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Do you still want to do it?

105
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Fukawa.

106
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Please say something.

107
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I can't do it now.

108
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Fukawa.

109
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Please say something.

110
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I'm in the middle of a meeting.

111
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Please say something.

112
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Fukawa.

113
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Don't get angry because I used the corner of the eraser.

114
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
The corner of the eraser.

115
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
The corner of the eraser.

116
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Don't get angry because I used the corner of the eraser.

117
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
The corner of the eraser?

118
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I'm sorry.

119
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Don't get angry because I used the corner of the eraser.

120
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
The corner of the eraser?

121
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Please say something.

122
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Don't get angry because I used the corner of the eraser.

123
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Put it in.

124
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
It's not a safe car.

125
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I ate it.

126
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Really?

127
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:19,000
It's tough.

128
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Please do it.

129
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Please do it.

130
00:07:44,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Please do it.

131
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,000
What should I do to change this?

132
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
This way.

133
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Put it in.

134
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I thought he was stupid.

135
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I thought he was stupid.

136
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I'll give you 5,000 yen.

137
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
What the hell are you doing?

138
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Damn it!

139
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
No way...

140
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Stop!

141
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I can't do it.

142
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,500
I can't do it.

143
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I can't do it.

144
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Do it.

145
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,000
You're so persistent.

146
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I can't do it.

147
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
That guy...

148
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Yama-chan is so lame.

149
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
He's so clingy!

150
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
He's so clingy!

151
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
He's so clingy!

152
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
He's so clingy!

153
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I didn't do anything.

154
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
That's true.

155
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Huh?

156
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Huh?

157
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Huh?

158
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I didn't do anything.

159
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I didn't do anything.

160
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I didn't do anything.

161
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I didn't do anything.

162
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
If I did, would you call me?

163
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I'm close to you.

164
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
You're such an idiot.

165
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
He's starting to get into it.

166
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
He's starting to get into it.

167
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
He's starting to get into it.

168
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
He's starting to get into it.

169
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
For example, if I did...

170
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Yeah?

171
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
You did?

172
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I got a message.

173
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
It's strange.

174
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Huh?

175
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Here?

176
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Where is it?

177
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
What is this?

178
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I'm doomed.

179
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I'm doomed.

180
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I'm doomed.

181
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
It's strange.

182
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I'm doomed.

183
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Hey!

184
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Hey!

185
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
It's done!

186
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
It's done!

187
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
It's done!

188
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
It's done!

189
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Fukawa-san's prize is...

190
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Fukawa-san's prize is...

191
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
It's 31,000 yen.

192
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
It's 31,000 yen!

193
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
It's 31,000 yen!

194
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
It's 31,000 yen!

195
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Thank you!

196
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Thank you!

197
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:10,000
To be honest, I didn't know how it would be until the third one.

198
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
It was terrible.

199
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Is this...

200
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Is this a step-up?

201
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
What are you talking about?

202
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
No, no, no.

203
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
It's not a strange meaning.

204
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I wonder if it's okay to encourage yourself.

205
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I don't want to watch it.

206
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I'll watch it again next time.

207
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I'll watch it again next time.

208
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I'm a kid's servant.

209
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Gaki Gaki-kun Gaki Gaki-kun

210
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Gaki Gaki-kun Gaki Gaki

211
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Gaki Gaki-kun Gaki Gaki-kun

212
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
When was it?

213
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
When we had the last talk.

214
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
The audience was terrible.

215
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Terrible.

216
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Was it today?

217
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
It was really terrible.

218
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
My heart was breaking.

219
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I was really depressed.

220
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I didn't do anything bad.

221
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I was really angry.

222
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Angry?

223
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Speaking of angry,

224
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I was having a meal at a bar.

225
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
And now,

226
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I was young.

227
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I was in third grade.

228
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
When I came to the bar,

229
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
the old lady was like,

230
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,000
What's that?

231
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
When I came to the bar,

232
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
it was strange.

233
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
The old lady was like,

234
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Imai-chan.

235
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
You know,

236
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
she was ignoring me on purpose.

237
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
It was strange.

238
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
She pushed me away.

239
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
She said,

240
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Imai-chan, shake my hand.

241
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I felt bad.

242
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Because I was a star.

243
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I was a star.

244
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
You have a big mouth.

245
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
You were a star.

246
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I don't have a big mouth.

247
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
She called me Imai-chan,

248
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
and I was like,

249
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
What do you think I did?

250
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I was shocked.

251
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
What did you do?

252
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I was like,

253
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Yes, I'm a star.

254
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Yes, I'm a star.

255
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
And she was like,

256
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Where are you hitting me?

257
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:34,000
This is what happens.

258
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Basically,

259
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
when I eat a side dish,

260
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I definitely want to eat rice.

261
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I can't eat rice.

262
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
When I eat a side dish,

263
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I can't eat rice.

264
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
The balance is weak.

265
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
If you don't eat it.

266
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
There's still rice left.

267
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Then eat more.

268
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I can't eat rice.

269
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I can't eat rice.

270
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Then eat more.

271
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Wait, Power!

272
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I can't get angry.

273
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Don't lie to me.

274
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
If it was you,

275
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
you wouldn't be living like this.

276
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Why?

277
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I don't know.

278
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I was scared of doing nothing.

279
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
But when I got home,

280
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I felt sick.

281
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Don't you think

282
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
you should do something like that?

283
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I'm so angry.

284
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
At times like that,

285
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I can't help but envy you.

286
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Why?

287
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
You can hit someone

288
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
without hesitation.

289
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Even if I say it,

290
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
my heart is like a businessman.

291
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I can't do that.

292
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
But the people at the store

293
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
are so considerate.

294
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Even if I say I'm sorry,

295
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I don't need any money today.

296
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Even if you say that,

297
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I don't need any money.

298
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I have a lot of money.

299
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I have a lot of money.

300
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
If I talk a little,

301
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
my heart will be like this.

302
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
When you were young,

303
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
you used to run a business

304
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
in a village in Iga.

305
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Please tell us

306
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
how to get rid of

307
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Kunoichi,

308
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
who is forbidden

309
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
from falling in love.

310
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
If you can't get rid of Kunoichi,

311
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
that means

312
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
you don't want to get rid of him.

313
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
You don't want to get rid of him.

314
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
That's what he thinks.

315
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
That's what he thinks.

316
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
But if you change the situation,

317
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
you can't get rid of him.

318
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
You can't get rid of him.

319
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
You're so particular about that.

320
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
You're so sensitive

321
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,000
about getting rid of him.

322
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
If you change the situation,

323
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
you want to get rid of him.

324
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
That's what he thinks.

325
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Is that so?

326
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
So,

327
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
you think

328
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
you shouldn't think

329
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
like that, right?

330
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
You shouldn't think

331
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
that way.

332
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
You shouldn't think

333
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
that way.

334
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
That's also bad, isn't it?

335
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Because you know

336
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
what's bad,

337
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
you shouldn't think

338
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
that way.

339
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
That's why

340
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Kunoichi is bad.

341
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Is that so?

342
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Kunoichi is bad.

343
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
He's a scoundrel.

344
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
What?

345
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Kunoichi is a scoundrel?

346
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Even with a katana,

347
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
he can do this

348
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
and that,

349
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
and he can do this.

350
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
He can do that.

351
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
He can do that.

352
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
He can do that.

353
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
He can do that.

354
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
He can do that.

355
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
What are you talking about?

356
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Tell me how to get rid of him.

357
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Shuriken

358
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
does this

359
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
really fast,

360
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
but if you look at him slowly,

361
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
when he comes back,

362
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
he does this.

363
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
That's why

364
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Kunoichi is bad.

365
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I get it now.

366
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Tell me how to get rid of him.

367
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
For example,

368
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
let's say

369
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I was targeted

370
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
by Kunoichi.

371
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I was targeted.

372
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I'm his enemy.

373
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
He's my enemy.

374
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
So I can't get rid of him

375
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
like I usually do.

376
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I can't get rid of him

377
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
like I usually do.

378
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I can't get rid of him

379
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
like I usually do.

380
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I can't get rid of him

381
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
like I usually do.

382
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
This is definitely

383
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
not good,

384
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
but I have one.

385
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
How did you get rid of him?

386
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I was sleeping.

387
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
I was sleeping.

388
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Then

389
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I heard a bang.

390
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I heard a bang.

391
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
So that's what

392
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
you're doing.

393
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
No, no.

394
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I think I was being attacked.

395
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I was being attacked.

396
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
That's weird.

397
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I was aiming at him.

398
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
There was

399
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
a slight gap

400
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
and light was leaking

401
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
from the other side.

402
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I think you were close.

403
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
It was leaking light.

404
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
It was leaking light.

405
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
I was sleeping

406
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
and I heard a bang.

407
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I heard a bang.

408
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Get ready!

409
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Did he come?

410
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
I would be surprised.

411
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
You would be surprised.

412
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
All of a sudden.

413
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
He was wearing

414
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
a short-sleeved shirt like this.

415
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
It was a short-sleeved shirt.

416
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Get ready!

417
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
This is where it starts.

418
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
You can't be surprised here.

419
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
I don't know.

420
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I thought I was done.

421
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Well, I really thought it was a yes, but I didn't want to say it.

422
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I wasn't prepared or anything, but I said it.

423
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
You idiot!

424
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
It wasn't that easy.

425
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:32,000
You idiot, you can't do that.

426
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
It was easy.

427
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
It wasn't that easy.

428
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
It was easy.

429
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
I mean, I caught it.

430
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
It was right here.

431
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Stop it!

432
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I'm going to find it!

433
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
That was fast.

434
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
It wasn't that easy.

435
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Well, he did it too.

436
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
You can't just do it like that.

437
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:12,000
What is this? It's like a ball.

438
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
What are you doing?

439
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
It's gone.

440
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Tonight is the night.

441
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:28,000
When Anpanman sees someone who's hungry and in trouble, he tears up his face.

442
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,000
When Matsumoto sees someone in trouble, what does he do?

443
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Basically, it's the same.

444
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Anpanman really tears up his face.

445
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,000
I really don't tear up my face because I'm an Anpanman.

446
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:50,000
But you see, it's like he's smiling.

447
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
What is this?

448
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
For example, look at my face.

449
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Why do I have to see your smile at this distance?

450
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Everyone, look at my face.

451
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
You still remember my name, don't you?

452
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Happy birthday to you.

453
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:49,000
This is Yamazaki Hosei's birthday.

454
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
That's right.

455
00:22:51,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Happy birthday to you.

456
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Happy birthday to you.

457
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Everyone, look at my face.

458
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Look at my face.

459
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
It's already out.
