1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
What kind of second half will the serious battle with the pride of winning and losing be like?

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Let's go as far as we can go!

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:23,000
From now on, everyone will be given a variety of settings, so let's see how long it will take to complete those settings.

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:30,000
If it's cold, if you can't take it anymore, please press this button.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
If you can't take it anymore, please press this button.

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The person with the shortest seconds will be me, Shibakunasu.

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Shibaku?

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
What does Shibaku mean?

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
It means Shibaku.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Shimi?

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Yes, yes.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
That's a long story.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
First of all, Yamazaki-san.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Your topic is...

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
An impersonation of Tawara Toshihiko.

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
This is really...

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
This is really tough.

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Let's go as far as we can go!

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Ready...

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Sorry.

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'm too old.

23
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm sorry.

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm sorry.

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm sorry.

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
What is this?

27
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
What is this?

28
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
What is this?

29
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Are you okay?

30
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Are you okay?

31
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Are you okay?

32
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Is this going to be long?

33
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Yama-chan, 14 seconds.

34
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
14 seconds.

35
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
It's going to be even longer.

36
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
14 seconds?

37
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
This game...

38
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
This game is dangerous.

39
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Next is Endo.

40
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Endo's topic is...

41
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Guitar solo.

42
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Wow!

43
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Wow!

44
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Wow!

45
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Wow!

46
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Wow!

47
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Yamazaki-san, you look like a *** girl.

48
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Yama-chan, Yama-chan, Yama-chan.

49
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
This program is brought to you by the following sponsors.

50
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Endo-san, quickly bring the guitar.

51
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
This is not a guitar.

52
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
This is tough.

53
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Let's go, Endo-san.

54
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Let's go as far as we can go!

55
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Ready!

56
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
You did your best.

57
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
It's been a minute or two since I started.

58
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Let's go.

59
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Next is Miyasako.

60
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Miyasako's topic is...

61
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Octopus dance.

62
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
This octopus dance is going to be long.

63
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
It's long.

64
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Let's go.

65
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Miyasako, you can do it!

66
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Let's go!

67
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Ready!

68
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
This is the worst.

69
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
This is the worst.

70
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
You're doing well.

71
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
22 seconds.

72
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
22 seconds.

73
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Thank you.

74
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Thank you very much.

75
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Don't cry.

76
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
This is too hard.

77
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Let's go.

78
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Next is Tanaka.

79
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Tanaka's topic is...

80
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Impersonation of Bruce Lee.

81
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
It's been a while since I've done this.

82
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Let's go, Tanaka.

83
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Let's go as far as we can go!

84
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Ready!

85
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
It's over!

86
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
There are two left.

87
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Hoto-chan.

88
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Hoto-chan's topic is...

89
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Big explosion.

90
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
What did you say?

91
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Big explosion.

92
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Big explosion?

93
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Me?

94
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
It's cold.

95
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
It's cold.

96
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
This is too bad.

97
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Let's go, Hoto-chan.

98
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Let's go as far as we can go!

99
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Ready!

100
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Hoto-chan!

101
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I get it.

102
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
This is too hard.

103
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
It's because it's a big explosion.

104
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
It's because you're dead.

105
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Hoto-chan, 4 seconds.

106
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Let's go as far as we can go.

107
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
The last one is Matsumoto-san.

108
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Matsumoto-san's topic is...

109
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Impersonation of a chicken.

110
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
This is embarrassing.

111
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
This is the hardest one.

112
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Don't cry so much!

113
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I was just training myself to cry.

114
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Damn it!

115
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
This is the hardest one.

116
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Let's go!

117
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
It's cold!

118
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
It's cold!

119
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Look at me!

120
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Look at me!

121
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Let's go!

122
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Ready!

123
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Hoto-chan!

124
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
4 seconds!

125
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:02,000
This is really hard.

126
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Hoto-chan, 4 seconds.

127
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
What?

128
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
4 seconds.

129
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
It's Hoto-chan!

130
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Thank goodness!

131
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
It's dangerous!

132
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
It's cold!

133
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
It's cold!

134
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Let's go!

135
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Let's go!

136
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Let's go!

137
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Let's go!

138
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Everyone, do you remember this?

139
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
We did this before, right?

140
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
There are 6 lines.

141
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Put your name plate on it.

142
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,000
If you open it, you'll know who will get punished.

143
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
There are 5 lines in order.

144
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
There are 15 lines.

145
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Take it to the other person so you don't get punished.

146
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
But there is one line that you can't put on the other person.

147
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:05,000
If you can't put it on the other person, you'll get punished.

148
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Why did you get punished?

149
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Let's announce the first punishment game!

150
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
The first punishment game is this!

151
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Stone wash!

152
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
There is one person who gets punished.

153
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
The remaining 5 people will stand in a line.

154
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Stone wash in order.

155
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Stone wash in order.

156
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I'll definitely win!

157
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Everyone, put your name plate under the line.

158
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Who will get punished?

159
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:04,000
This is the end of the first round.

160
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Please put your name plate under the line.

161
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
There are times when you can't put your name plate under the line.

162
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Don't put your name plate under the line.

163
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
There are 15 lines.

164
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I want to run away, so I'll give it to Matsumoto-san.

165
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Please throw it away.

166
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Matsumoto-san ran away.

167
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I'll give it back to Matsumoto-san.

168
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Please give it to both of you.

169
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,000
This is not good.

170
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I'll give it to Matsumoto-san.

171
00:09:51,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Please give it back to Matsumoto-san.

172
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
This punishment game is stone wash.

173
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
There are times when you can't put your name plate under the line.

174
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I'll give it to Matsumoto-san.

175
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I'll give it back to Matsumoto-san.

176
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I'll give it back to Matsumoto-san.

177
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Matsumoto-san, come here.

178
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I really want to do this.

179
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
This punishment game is stone wash.

180
00:10:46,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Please give it back to Matsumoto-san.

181
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Please give it back to Matsumoto-san.

182
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I'll give it back to Matsumoto-san.

183
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:32,000
This punishment game is wet tissue.

184
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Please give it back to Matsumoto-san.

185
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I'll give it back to Matsumoto-san.

186
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I'll give it back to Matsumoto-san.

187
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I'll give it back to Matsumoto-san.

188
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:23,000
