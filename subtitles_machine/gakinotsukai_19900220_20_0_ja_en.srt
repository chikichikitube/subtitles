00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,500
Down-Town's Gaki no Tsukai Yaraen, Gekitotsu, Chikitsuki Sannin-chan Marathon Race!

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,000
Welcome to the event!

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,500
Today, we're going to take care of the mecha.

4
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,000
Matsumoto-san, please come up here.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
How are the mechas doing?

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
You're not sweating, are you?

7
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:19,000
It's cold.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Say something!

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Me too.

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Normally, that guy would be cold and tired.

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,500
It's really cold.

12
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:28,000
What the hell is this?

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
This is the first time.

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
You've never done this before.

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
This is ridiculous.

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
It's the start.

17
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Let's go!

18
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
In America, this is a gentlemen's sport.

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Do you know where America is?

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I do.

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Really?

22
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
It's a gentlemen's sport.

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
It's a gentlemen's sport.

24
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
It's not a cowardly sport.

25
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
It's a gentleman's sport?

26
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Yes.

27
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm not lying.

28
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
You're not lying?

29
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Of course.

30
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm a little worried about the mecha.

31
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The oil I saw earlier is leaking.

32
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Where is it?

33
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Where is it?

34
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
There's a problem with the tires.

35
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I'll look up.

36
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Oh, I'm sorry.

37
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm sorry.

38
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Shall we start?

39
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:13,500
Yes.

40
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:14,500
Please start.

41
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,000
I'll go like this.

42
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Here we go.

43
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Hey!

44
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I told you to do it properly!

45
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
It's dangerous!

46
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
It's dangerous!

47
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
It's dangerous!

48
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
It's dangerous!

49
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
It's dangerous!

50
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
It's dangerous!

51
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I'm dead.

52
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
What should I do?

53
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
What are you doing?

54
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
What are you doing?

55
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I can't stop sweating.

56
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Let's stop.

57
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
It hurts.

58
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
It's hard.

59
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
It's really hard.

60
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Which way?

61
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
This way.

62
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
That way?

63
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I'm dead.

64
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I'm dead.

65
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Why are you sweating here?

66
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I'm dead.

67
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I'm dead.

68
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Who thought of this?

69
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
While riding.

70
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Excuse me.

71
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Everyone on the way.

72
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Don't you have a lipstick?

73
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Yes.

74
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I see.

75
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Now I understand the meaning.

76
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Downtown?

77
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Downtown?

78
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Downtown?

79
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Stop it!

80
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Get out of my way!

81
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
What should I do?

82
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Drink it! Drink it! Drink it!

83
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Can I drink it?

84
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Is this okay?

85
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Yes.

86
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I'm scared.

87
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I can't do it anymore.

88
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I can't do it anymore.

89
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I can't do it anymore.

90
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Stop it!

91
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I can't reach it.

92
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I'll kill you.

93
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I can't do it anymore.

94
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
It hurts.

95
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Hurry up.

96
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Hurry up.

97
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I'm really dead.

98
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I'm tired.

99
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
But I won.

100
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
It's good to exercise sometimes.

101
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Yes.

102
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Thank you very much.

103
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Today, I played like this.

104
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Let's go to the venue later and talk.

105
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Yes.

106
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Let's go.

107
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Yes.

108
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Who is this person?

109
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Who is this person?

110
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I don't know.

111
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
What?

112
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Ladies and gentlemen.

113
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
You're still in front of him.

114
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Yes.

115
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,000
You came to a strange place again today.

116
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
But it's Ikebukuro.

117
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I don't know if it's Ikebukuro.

118
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I'm in the middle of it.

119
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
What?

120
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I'm in the middle of it.

121
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
And there's a dirty park in front of it.

122
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Wow.

123
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
You're crazy.

124
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
What?

125
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Thanks to that park, I had a great time today.

126
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
What is that opening?

127
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I'm a human being.

128
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I want to kill you.

129
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,000
You prepared a signboard and a thing to use in the sports festival.

130
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I'm angry.

131
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I'm at Tokyo Station.

132
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I'm angry.

133
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I'm angry.

134
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I'm angry.

135
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I'm angry.

136
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I'm angry.

137
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I'm angry.

138
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I'm angry.

139
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I'm angry.

140
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I'm angry.

141
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I'm angry.

142
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I'm angry.

143
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I'm angry.

144
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I'm angry.

145
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I'm angry.

146
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I'm angry.

147
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
It's scary.

148
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
He's so cool.

149
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
That's scary.

150
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Aren't you car scarier?

151
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
That's scarier.

152
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Oh, really?

153
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I need your cooperation.

154
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Please cooperate!

155
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
If you leave this Неo here won't stop until it reacts to me.

156
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
It won't simply ignore me?

157
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
If you ignore it, you'll know it.

158
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Please cooperate!

159
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Is it really noisy?

160
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
This is really loud.

161
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
You want me to bring the box?

162
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
That's not what I was talking about.

163
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Yeah

164
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Just bring the money.

165
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Just let us bring it.

166
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
It's not very heavy.

167
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Yeah.

168
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I was so angry.

169
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I was so jealous.

170
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I said, huh?

171
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
It's not your fault.

172
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I said, huh?

173
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
And she was like...

174
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
What's with that face?

175
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
You should have put that in the video.

176
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Don't make that face.

177
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I was so frustrated.

178
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
But you shouldn't be like that.

179
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
It's not true.

180
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
You should have put it in the video.

181
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
It was so embarrassing.

182
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I shouldn't have put it in the video.

183
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Isn't it embarrassing?

184
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
It's common, isn't it?

185
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
The red feathers...

186
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
You should do it.

187
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
That's right.

188
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
The young people are different.

189
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
They're shy.

190
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
They're not shy at all.

191
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
But after they've changed...

192
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
The old man says,

193
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
They've changed.

194
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
You know, the way he expresses it is so rude.

195
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
No, it's just in his heart.

196
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
It's like, let's go home, let's go home.

197
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
That's what it is.

198
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I understand that.

199
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
That's a trick, right?

200
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Everyone's perspective.

201
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
He's just being nice and trying to look cool.

202
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
That's just what everyone hates.

203
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Ah, I see.

204
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
That's really what I hate.

205
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
The smile that you make when you get tired of it.

206
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
But I was made to do that.

207
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I was like, why are you doing this on TV, on stage?

208
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,000
And the audience was laughing, but there was at least one person with a sad face.

209
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Like that guy, Frillman.

210
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Frillman!

211
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Frillman.

212
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
You're my mother!

213
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
This is a different story.

214
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I was talking to a friend.

215
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Men are really a pain in the ass.

216
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Don't say that together.

217
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Men are really a pain in the ass.

218
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Why?

219
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I don't think it's like that at all, but he has a habit of talking.

220
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
He's walking and there's no one around, but he says,

221
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Ah, I'm tired.

222
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
He says that a lot.

223
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
He's not tired at all.

224
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
He's not tired, but he says,

225
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Ah, I'm tired.

226
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Even when it's not that cold, he says,

227
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Ah, I'm cold.

228
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
He says that a lot.

229
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
He doesn't say, I'm tired.

230
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
He doesn't say that a lot, but he says that a lot.

231
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Men and women are the same.

232
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,000
And in the case of men, there's something nasty coming in, right?

233
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Like, I want to do it.

234
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
There's a way.

235
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I want to do it.

236
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
There is!

237
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
There is!

238
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
There is!

239
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
There is!

240
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
There is!

241
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
There is!

242
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
There is!

243
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
There is!

244
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
There is!

245
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
There is!

246
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
There is!

247
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,000
There is!

248
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
There is!

249
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,000
There is!

250
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:45,000
There is!

251
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
There are definitely men.

252
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Right?

253
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
There was a time when I wanted to write in Osaka dialect.

254
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
On Fuji TV.

255
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I was laughing by myself.

256
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
It was really funny.

257
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
You're laughing too much.

258
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
There was a rehearsal in my dream.

259
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
When I came,

260
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Uchanan-chan wasn't there.

261
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Uchanan-chan said,

262
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I'm a little late for work.

263
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Uchanan-chan's rehearsal didn't start yet.

264
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I said,

265
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I'm going to the toilet.

266
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I went to the toilet alone.

267
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
He opened the door for me.

268
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I want to write Uchanan-chan.

269
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
No, I don't want to write Uchanan-chan.

270
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
You're lying.

271
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Really.

272
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
You're lying.

273
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I'm serious.

274
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I don't want to write Uchanan-chan.

275
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I don't think so.

276
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Really.

277
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I want to write Uchanan-chan.

278
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
It's not related to me.

279
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
It's mixed.

280
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I don't think so.

281
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I want to write Uchanan-chan.

282
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
That's too bad.

283
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I'm serious.

284
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I was embarrassed.

285
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
There are times when I'm told to write.

286
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
For example,

287
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I'm in the same school.

288
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I'm in the same school.

289
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I'm in the same school.

290
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I'm in the same school.

291
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I'm in the same school.

292
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I was in the school.

293
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
The man next to me wrote while doing it.

294
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I don't know him at all.

295
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I wrote it.

296
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I said, hey.

297
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I said, hey to him.

298
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I said, hey.

299
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I thought I didn't understand.

300
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
That's...

301
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
That's...

302
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
That's my...

303
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
That's my...

304
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
That's my...

305
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
That's my...

306
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
That's my...

307
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
That's my...

308
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I wrote it.

309
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Hey.

310
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Even the old man couldn't stand it.

311
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I couldn't stand it.

312
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I wrote it to a guy I didn't know at all.

313
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I wrote it to a guy I didn't know at all.

314
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
That's true.

315
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I just said it.

316
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
That's embarrassing.

317
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I was on the plane.

318
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I put on my earphones.

319
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I couldn't understand my voice.

320
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
That was embarrassing.

321
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Right?

322
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I was in the plane.

323
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I was in the plane.

324
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I was in the plane.

325
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I was in the plane.

326
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I was in the plane.

327
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I was in the plane.

328
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I was in the plane.

329
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I was in the plane.

330
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
You can't hear the sound of the train.

331
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
And Ishikawa Hidemi-chan.

332
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
She came in suddenly.

333
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
When the train came in suddenly,

334
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Ishikawa Hidemi-chan!

335
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Ishikawa Hidemi-chan.

336
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
What is this?

337
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
That's me, but...

338
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
It was about 5 years ago.

339
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
That's right.

340
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I was working in Tokyo.

341
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
When I came here,

342
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I couldn't hear my own voice.

343
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
So I told the person next to me,

344
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I'm Ishikawa Hidemiya.

345
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I was going to say,

346
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I'm Ishikawa Hidemiya.

347
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I was going to say,

348
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I'm Ishikawa Hidemiya.

349
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I couldn't hear my own voice.

350
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
That's embarrassing.

351
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
You have to be careful.

352
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Let's move on to the postcards.

353
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Please show us the postcards.

354
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I can't laugh.

355
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I don't like it.

356
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Are you ready?

357
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
You don't have to say who it is.

358
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I'm ready.

359
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Let me introduce the postcards.

360
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
There are rumors about you.

361
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
There are rumors about you.

362
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
That you're the Yakuza Akari.

363
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
That you're the Yakuza Akari.

364
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
You're an idiot!

365
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
That comment is a copy of your past.

366
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
That comment is a copy of your past.

367
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I think you can understand that.

368
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Why?

369
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
There are many people who think so.

370
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
That's not true.

371
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
What are you talking about?

372
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I think you should quit.

373
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
You should quit being an amateur.

374
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
You should quit being an amateur.

375
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
What are you talking about?

376
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
If an amateur comes out,

377
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
you'll get hit in the head.

378
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
What are you talking about?

379
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
You shouldn't talk like that.

380
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
You'll break the pot.

381
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I won't hit the pot anymore.

382
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I'll break the pot.

383
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
You shouldn't do that.

384
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
It's disgusting.

385
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I'm just doing this for fun.

386
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I'm just doing this for fun.

387
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
You shouldn't say,

388
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
That person in Osaka is Katsura.

389
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
That person in Osaka is Katsura.

390
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
There are rumors about you.

391
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
You'll get hit in the head.

392
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
You'll break the pot.

393
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
You'll have to keep saying that.

394
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
You'll break the pot.

395
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
You'll break the pot.

396
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
You'll break the pot.

397
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
You'll break the pot.

398
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
You should quit.

399
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Don't say I have a bad mouth.

400
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
It's not a big deal.

401
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Everyone in Osaka is like this.

402
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
That's not true. I'm not that kind of person.

403
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Why?

404
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
It's because I'm a waki-jita.

405
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
You're a waki-jita?

406
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
You're a waki-jita?

407
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I'm talking normally.

408
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
It's my fault.

409
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Let's be a little more polite.

410
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Can you say that?

411
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
You're a waki-jita.

412
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
And you like to make fun of me.

413
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
What are you talking about?

414
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Why are you saying pan pan pan?

415
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I don't understand.

416
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Shut up.

417
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Why are you saying pan pan pan?

418
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
What kind of sound is that?

419
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Hey.

420
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
What?

421
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
What kind of sound is that?

422
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I don't understand what you're saying.

423
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I don't understand.

424
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Get out of my way.

425
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Pan pan pan.

426
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
What kind of sound is that?

427
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I don't understand.

428
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
You're a waki-jita.

429
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
What kind of sound is that?

430
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Next.

431
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I'm looking forward to the future of Hamada Matsumoto.

432
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
How about a penalty game?

433
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
How about a penalty game?

434
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
How about a penalty game?

435
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
How about a penalty game?

436
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
How about a penalty game?

437
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
You just bit me.

438
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
You just bit me.

439
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Cupid 3 minutes cooking.

440
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
How about it?

441
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
It's good.

442
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
It's good.

443
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
What kind of game is that?

444
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
What kind of game is that?

445
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
How about a stopwatch game?

446
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Really?

447
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Yes.

448
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
It's good.

449
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Do you still play Cupid 3 minutes cooking?

450
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Yes, I do.

451
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Really?

452
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I like Cupid 3 minutes cooking.

453
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
You don't like it?

454
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I like it.

455
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I don't like it.

456
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Really?

457
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Yes.

458
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
You don't like it?

459
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I don't like it.

460
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
To the girl who is everywhere,

461
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,000
you are going to cheat.

462
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I'm really happy to see you like this.

463
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I really like you.

464
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Only you.

465
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
What is this?

466
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I'm really happy to see you like this.

467
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I'm really happy to see you like this.

468
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
This is how you say, you know?

469
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
That's not how you say it.

470
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I'm so happy that I can see each and every one of your letters.

471
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Seriously.

472
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,000
You've never written a single letter back to me.

473
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Don't say such bad things.

474
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I'm telling the truth.

475
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,000
How much do I care about my fans?

476
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I really want to do this and that for each and every one of them.

477
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Who the hell did you leave your presents on the street in Minami, Osaka on Christmas day?

478
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
He's a terrible guy.

479
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Look at my eyes.

480
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Which one do you trust, me or him?

481
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:13,000
You.

482
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:18,000
You're the one who's holding it and hitting it down.

483
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Don't say such stupid things.

484
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Who did you imitate?

485
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I didn't imitate anything.

486
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
You're so stupid.

487
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Stop it.

488
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I'm telling you to stop it.

489
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Stop it.

490
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Everyone knows that I'm kind.

491
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Why?

492
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
What do you mean by kind?

493
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I'm the one who has that kind of love.

494
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Why?

495
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Have you ever done anything kind?

496
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Do you know why I'm working so hard?

497
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I save up money to buy a house for kids.

498
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
There's no such thing as a house for kids.

499
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,000
On Christmas day, I always bring my kids to the park and play the guitar.

500
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
You're lying.

501
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
You don't even play the guitar.

502
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I'm so angry.

503
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Suddenly?

504
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I'm so angry.

505
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I'm so angry.

506
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
What kind of angry?

507
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I'm shaking.

508
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Kids are weak to shaking.

509
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
If I was an adult, I'd be able to walk properly.

510
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
But they can't walk at all.

511
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Of course they can.

512
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
They have a different walking history.

513
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
We've been walking for 26 years.

514
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
But they're like this.

515
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
They're stupid.

516
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
What do you mean by stupid?

517
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
They're stupid.

518
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
That's not enough.

519
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
They're like this.

520
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
They're so good.

521
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I'm going to the toilet.

522
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,000
I'm going to the Japanese-style toilet.

523
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I'm going to the toilet.

524
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I'm going to the toilet.

525
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I'm going to the toilet.

526
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I'm going to the toilet.

527
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I'm going to the toilet.

528
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I'm going to the toilet.

529
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I'm going to the toilet.

530
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I'm going to the toilet.

531
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I'm going to theく toilet.

532
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
I'm going to the q's toilet.

533
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I'm going to the toilet.

534
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I'm going to the toilet.

535
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
I'm going to the toilet.

536
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
This way.

537
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Go down.

538
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
an irresistible

539
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
They have dirty everywhere.

540
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
They have dirty everywhere.

541
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I want to put my hands in dirty places.

542
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
They're remembered.

543
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
They're remembered.

544
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Trash!

545
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Trash!

546
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Trash!

547
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
We are still looking for a punishment game.

548
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:37,000
If you look at the post, the child's user is...

549
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Hey!

550
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
You!

551
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Don't use the public radio!

552
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
You're so mean!

553
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,000
You can say sorry!

554
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,000
You thought you were going to hit me, didn't you?

555
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
I did that, Yota!

556
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
I

557
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,000
don't know how to make a sound!

558
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
It would be fine!

559
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Oh, MZ?

560
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,000
When you smell it, you can realize when you came back!

561
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,000
It goes like this.

562
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,000
So I wrap the tissue and use my fingers to scratch it.

563
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
It's dirty!

564
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Are you a monster?

565
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
If you scratch it, it won't come out.

566
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
It will come out cleanly.

567
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
It will come out.

568
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Really?

569
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I don't know.

570
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
I don't know how to do it.

571
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,000
You can teach me how to do it, but it's difficult.

572
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Right?

573
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Yes.

574
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
By the way, it's called Ohira-Aki.

575
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
That's right.

576
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
It's a punishment game.

577
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
We're looking for various things.

578
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
That's right.

579
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
That's all for today.

580
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Thank you very much.

581
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
How was the tricycle?

582
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
The tricycle?

583
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Yes.

584
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
It was the first time.

585
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
It was hard.

586
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
It was a long distance.

587
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
My legs hurt.

588
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Yes.

589
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
It was difficult.

590
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:21,000
When I came to the park, there was a slope.

591
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:26,000
The person who made it had a strange head.

592
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
I couldn't help it, so I found it.

593
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
I can't climb it.

594
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:36,000
You can't do that.

595
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
I prepared a lot of things.

596
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Which one is the SM school you went to?

597
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
I'm an assistant.

598
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
I don't think it's funny.

599
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
What is this?

600
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
I'm getting angry.

601
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,000
If you accept it a little, you'll be in trouble.

602
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
This is a little strange.

603
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
You can't read the atmosphere.

604
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
How many times do you have to do this?

605
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,000
I don't know what to do.

606
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
What are you going to do next week?

607
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
I don't know, so I'll do it next week.

608
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
I'm going to get angry.

609
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
I prepared such a delicious ingredient.

610
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Why can't I read it?

611
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
I can't sell it.

612
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
I'm an amateur.

613
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
I don't know what to do.

614
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I don't know what to do.

615
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
This is a person who wants to drink.

616
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
I say it every week.

617
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
I don't know what to do.

618
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
I'm thinking of a punishment game.

619
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
That's all for this time.

620
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Goodbye.
