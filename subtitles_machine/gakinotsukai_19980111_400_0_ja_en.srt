1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
In commemoration of the 400th anniversary of Hishiku, we will be giving you a special gift!

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
It's the 400th anniversary?

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Yes, it's the 400th anniversary.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Is that so?

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
You're all so talented, why did you come here?

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I don't know.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I don't know.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
What?

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I don't know.

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Did you read it?

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
No, I didn't read it.

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Huh? Yamasaki?

13
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I didn't read it at all.

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Why?

15
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
No, no, no.

16
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
It's okay, it's okay.

17
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Even if it's an incident.

18
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
That's because I'm the one who gave it to you.

19
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Do you know that?

20
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
My dad is a comedian.

21
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
It's the 400th anniversary.

22
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
We started the first episode on October 3, 1989.

23
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Is that so?

24
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Yamaguchi-san, how many episodes have you done?

25
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I've been doing it since the second episode.

26
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
We've been making it together.

27
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Did you participate in Koho-riko?

28
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Yes, since a year ago.

29
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
This is the 56th episode.

30
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Let's eat it clean.

31
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Did you participate from here?

32
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Yes, I participated from here.

33
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Since that year, the kid has been powering down.

34
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
This program is brought to you by these sponsors.

35
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:27,000
For the time being, this has become a series several times.

36
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Let's take a look at this.

37
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Can you take a picture of this?

38
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
It's strange that you can take a picture so quickly.

39
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I was listening.

40
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
A special project for the new year.

41
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
A challenge to catch up with Shinten.

42
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Who will be the problem?

43
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Will this sword be a toy?

44
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
It's not a toy.

45
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Matsumoto Shirojo, who is ready for the new year, appears.

46
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
If I was told about it before, I wouldn't be able to do it.

47
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I succeeded in Masamune, but they didn't understand it.

48
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
That's what it is.

49
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Let's do it.

50
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
This is Catherine.

51
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Is this Catherine?

52
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
It's to unify the mind.

53
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
It takes two or three minutes.

54
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Of course.

55
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Are you going to do it?

56
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Let's do it.

57
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Matsumoto Shirojo, who is ready for the new year, appears.

58
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
It's strange.

59
00:02:52,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Matsumoto Shirojo, who is ready for the new year, appears.

60
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Are you okay with your bangs?

61
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
How is it?

62
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
It's quite nerve-racking.

63
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I can't see it.

64
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I can't see it.

65
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
It's fine.

66
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Let's do it.

67
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I hit it.

68
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Come on.

69
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
The third.

70
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
The second one was dangerous.

71
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
The second one was dangerous.

72
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
The second one was dangerous.

73
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
The second one was dangerous.

74
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
This one is also crazy.

75
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
It's nostalgic.

76
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
It's also young.

77
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Yes.

78
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Thin.

79
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Thin.

80
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Next.

81
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Yes.

82
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I see.

83
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Right?

84
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I wonder if it's okay to look at this.

85
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
A child's summer vacation comparison.

86
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Manager Okamoto is angry again.

87
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
A man who has defeated his own existence with a life-threatening challenge.

88
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Do you know?

89
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Manager Okamoto.

90
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I'm from Okinawa.

91
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
With this one word, he was forced to bring a child to Okinawa.

92
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
What is Okamoto challenging?

93
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Don't do that.

94
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Why?

95
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Because cats don't like it.

96
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
How many times have you been to Okinawa?

97
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Hey, stop smoking.

98
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Are you stupid?

99
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Are you really stupid?

100
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
You haven't been here yet.

101
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I've been to Okinawa many times.

102
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Cats are scared.

103
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
That one?

104
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Yes.

105
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Which one?

106
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
That one.

107
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
What are you doing?

108
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Okamoto, dive into the water.

109
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Like a blowfish.

110
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
A blowfish in the water.

111
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Manager Okamoto challenges a blowfish in the water.

112
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Okamoto.

113
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Okamoto.

114
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Okamoto.

115
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
What's wrong with you?

116
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I'm thirsty.

117
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I'm thirsty.

118
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Are you ready?

119
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Yes.

120
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I'm ready.

121
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
What are you doing?

122
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
What are you doing?

123
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
What are you doing?

124
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I'm just removing the skin!

125
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Take it off!

126
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
It's spicy!

127
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
If you come here and take the tip of the bamboo, we'll go down.

128
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I'll push you!

129
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Let's go!

130
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Let's go!

131
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
This way!

132
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
The direction is wrong!

133
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Let's go!

134
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Okamoto-san!

135
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Let's go!

136
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
This is reality.

137
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
This picture is ideal.

138
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
That's right. It's like a dream.

139
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
It's perfect.

140
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Number 250.

141
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Number 250?

142
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
If you come here and take the tip of the bamboo, we'll go down.

143
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Thank you very much.

144
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
What are the viewers doing?

145
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
The viewers are angry.

146
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Hurry up and take the tip of the bamboo!

147
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
The viewers are angry.

148
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:51,000
In the entertainment world, there are two strong men who divide the power of the society.

149
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
They don't know the amount of blood they shed.

150
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,000
The head-to-head conflict has deepened the level of confusion.

151
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Stop it! Stop it!

152
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
They don't know what to fear when they're cut off.

153
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Stop it! Stop it!

154
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
The entertainment world is fast to cut off.

155
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Yamazaki Hosei.

156
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Burning the fire of hatred.

157
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Yotami.

158
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Aimaniel.

159
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Aimaniel.

160
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
You haven't been on TV lately, have you?

161
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I don't know.

162
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
You know what?

163
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I'm looking for a job.

164
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Even if you're on TV, it's better to be on TV.

165
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Don't you know what it's like to be on the other side of the screen?

166
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I don't know what it's like to be on the other side of the screen.

167
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
You can't do that.

168
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
You can't do that.

169
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
You're the only one who can do that.

170
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Don't say such a thing.

171
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Let it burn. Let it burn.

172
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
So hot!

173
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
It's so hot!

174
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
It's like a prison!

175
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
It's frozen!

176
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
It's so hot!

177
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
It's so hot!

178
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I'm going to wash it with a firework shower!

179
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
It's so sticky!

180
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,000
What are you doing?

181
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I'm a human!

182
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I'm a human!

183
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
It's so hot!

184
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
It's so hot!

185
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
It was long, wasn't it?

186
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
You look like you're wearing see-through clothes!

187
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
How are you feeling now, Yamazaki-san?

188
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I'm so tired.

189
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
We still have a long way to go.

190
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
How are you doing these days?

191
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I've been doing my best.

192
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Is there anything you'd like to see?

193
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Goho Matsumoto's drawing class.

194
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I was surprised to see Hamada-san's drawings.

195
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
That was the debut of Sho Yuki.

196
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I laughed a lot, but it was clearly a stupid laugh.

197
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Goho Matsumoto's drawing class!

198
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Goho Matsumoto's drawing class!

199
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
We're going to draw on the same theme.

200
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
We're going to draw on the same theme.

201
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
We're going to draw on the same theme.

202
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I really like Disneyland, so I'll draw Mickey Mouse.

203
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Mickey Mouse!

204
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I'll draw myself.

205
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Do you want to see Garg's drawing?

206
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I see.

207
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
This is where the drawing was.

208
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I think so.

209
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
It's a very intense competition.

210
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
It's a very intense competition.

211
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I drew Mickey Mouse.

212
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
It's so funny.

213
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
The children are running away.

214
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
It's so funny.

215
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
It's so funny.

216
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
It may not look like it, but it's like this.

217
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
What?

218
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
It's scary, isn't it?

219
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
It's scary, isn't it?

220
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I have four ears.

221
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Let's move on to the next one.

222
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Here.

223
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,000
What is this?

224
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
The viewers will understand this.

225
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
It's strange.

226
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
This is bad.

227
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
This is the worst.

228
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I think I can draw well.

229
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I think I can draw well.

230
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Why don't we draw our own characters?

231
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
We'll draw our own characters.

232
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I'll take a look at it.

233
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
What kind of expression is that?

234
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
You're a monster!

235
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
What is this? What is this? What is this?

236
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
He's laughing.

237
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
It's his face.

238
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
What? Wait a minute!

239
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
This is it! Your mouth!

240
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I want you to laugh a little.

241
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Yes, yes.

242
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
There's a lot of wood.

243
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,000
After this, the favorite work of Downtown will appear.

244
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I want to see that.

245
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
A theme park.

246
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I've done a lot of openings.

247
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I like it a lot.

248
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:22,000
But the ratings are not good at all.

249
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I don't know what's left.

250
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I like it a lot.

251
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Welcome.

252
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Which one would you like?

253
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Coffee cup.

254
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Yes, please give me a coffee cup.

255
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Yes, please give me a coffee cup.

256
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Yes, please give me a coffee cup.

257
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Yes, please give me a coffee cup.

258
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Yes, please give me a coffee cup.

259
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Coffee cup start.

260
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Yes, please give me a coffee cup.

261
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Start.

262
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
It's over.

263
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
It's an ocean coaster!

264
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:18,000
It's an ocean coaster.

265
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Start.

266
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
It has an ocean coaster on it.

267
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
It's a good song.

268
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
It's a good song.

269
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
We're going to have a parade.

270
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I got it.

271
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Next customer, welcome.

272
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
You're just in time.

273
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
What time is it?

274
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
We're going to have a technical parade.

275
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Please come out for a moment.

276
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
The lights are beautiful.

277
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Okay, we're done.

278
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Let's go to the observatory for your father.

279
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
We're going to the observatory.

280
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Please take care of your father.

281
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I'll do my best.

282
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Please take care of your father.

283
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Thank you very much.

284
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Please get on the bus.

285
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
There's a bus.

286
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Please get on the bus.

287
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Please enjoy your trip.

288
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Please get on the bus.

289
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Please get on the bus.

290
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Please get on the bus.

291
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
It's a long way.

292
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
It's a long way.

293
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Please get on the bus.

294
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
It's a long way.

295
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
It was fun.

296
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
It's a long way.

297
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Do you have anything you want to see?

298
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Let's see what Jimmy has.

299
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Let's see what Jimmy has.

300
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Jimmy's manager is talking about his business.

301
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
He's watching if he can do it alone.

302
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
What's the result?

303
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I'll do it directly.

304
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
You can take it.

305
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I'm happy.

306
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
He can't get on the bus.

307
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
It's a long way.

308
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Let's go to the hospital.

309
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Where is TBS?

310
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Turn left and go straight.

311
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
It's better to go.

312
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Let's go.

313
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Jimmy has a job.

314
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I'll give you half of this.

315
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I'll give you half of this.

316
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I'll give you half of this.

317
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I'll give you half of this.

318
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Thank you very much.

319
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Thank you very much.

320
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Hello.

321
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Hello.

322
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
What should I do?

323
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
What should I do?

324
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
What should I do?

325
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
He's running away.

326
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
He's running away.

327
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I got it.

328
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I got it.

329
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I got it.

330
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I got it.

331
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
It's strange, but I'm here.

332
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
It's strange, but I'm here.

333
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Jimmy is here.

334
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Thank you very much.

335
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I'll give you half of this.

336
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I'll give you half of this.

337
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I'll give you half of this.

338
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Can you touch me?

339
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I'm naked.

340
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I'm naked.

341
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Why are you naked?

342
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Why are you naked?

343
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
I don't know.

344
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I'm scared.

345
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I'm scared.

346
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I'll go home.

347
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I'll go home.

348
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Thank you very much.

349
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Thank you very much.

350
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
My character did the taiyaki.

351
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
He's frowning.

352
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Oh, thank you very much.

353
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:45,500
That's all?

354
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,000
Yes.

355
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,000
Thank you very much.

356
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
I think I'll get a reward if I give it to her.

357
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Excuse me, miss.

358
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I'm really going home now.

359
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I'm really going home now.

360
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Um, from my manager...

361
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
The gyaru is...

362
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
That...

363
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Sakurai-san...

364
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
She said she'd give it to me.

365
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Oh, the gyaru that was so popular...

366
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I was thinking about it.

367
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
What?

368
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
What are you doing?

369
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Isn't that a cam?

370
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Kiss, kiss.

371
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
What are you doing?

372
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I'm going to take a bath.

373
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I'm going to take a bath.

374
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
After this, Hamada will be angry at that big artist.

375
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Hamada has been very angry before.

376
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Hamada-san?

377
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Yes.

378
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
He was so angry that he went to the barbershop.

379
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Did you see the barbershop yesterday?

380
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I think I saw it.

381
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
There was nothing there.

382
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Did they laugh?

383
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Have they ever laughed at what they said?

384
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
I don't think they've ever laughed.

385
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
That's right!

386
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
You shouldn't have said that.

387
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Your hair was long, and you didn't have ears.

388
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
I was told that a long time ago.

389
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
That you didn't have ears.

390
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
You're a comedian.

391
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
I don't think it's funny.

392
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
That's enough.

393
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Hamada Masatoshi.

394
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
I'm going to take a bath.

395
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I went to your barbershop, so it's okay.

396
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
We didn't do anything.

397
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Rather, listen to the song.

398
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
What song?

399
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
I'm going to take a bath.

400
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
I'm going to take a bath.

401
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Okay?

402
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
But...

403
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Machine?

404
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
It's machi, right?

405
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
He's manly.

406
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Azuki-chan is really good at singing

407
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
You guys are really good

408
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
He's controlling something

409
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
This is Ikansho

410
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
He's singing

411
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
It's Azuki-san, right?

412
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Let's go on a ride together

413
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Let's go on a ride together

414
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
It's a long ride

415
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
It's a long ride

416
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Didn't you tell him?

417
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
I told him

418
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
I told him

419
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
I'm saying this because I don't like bad guys

420
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
I'm saying this on behalf of everyone

421
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
I'm saying this for you

422
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
I didn't know

423
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
I don't know

424
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:19,000
I don't know

425
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
What happened?

426
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
This is my life

427
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
It seems like he understood

428
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
I said everything I wanted to say

429
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
I know

430
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
I know

431
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
I know

432
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
I know

433
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
He was angry

434
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Really?

435
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
He said I'm not that fat

436
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
That's how it is

437
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
There's no problem

438
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
There's no problem

439
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
There were many things

440
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
There's no limit

441
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
There's no limit

442
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Let's do this again

443
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Let's do this 420 times
