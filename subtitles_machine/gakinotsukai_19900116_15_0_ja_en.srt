1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Good evening, everyone.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Good evening.

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Today, we're at the Shinjuku Gyoen.

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
That's right.

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
If we had another camera, I'd like to film these idiots.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
In the middle of winter...

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Let me introduce them to you.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
You're idiots, right?

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
It's cold outside every time.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
So the staff told us not to dress warmly.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
They told us to wear T-shirts 24 hours a day.

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Today, all the staff are wearing T-shirts 24 hours a day.

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
They're doing their best.

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
The staff around here...

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
We're...

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
It's really cold today.

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It's about 9 degrees today.

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Look at that.

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
What is that?

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
That's called a kit.

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
It's a painful thing.

22
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
What's a kit?

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Theater Sun Mall.

24
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
They put a bottle of coke with a dollar in it on the table.

25
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I see.

26
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
And they want you to sit here.

27
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
That's amazing.

28
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
If you do it in a hall like this, it's usually slippery.

29
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
It's slippery.

30
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
That's how it is.

31
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
That's how it is.

32
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
It's like a revenge movie.

33
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
A big explosion.

34
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
A big explosion.

35
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I wonder if it's okay.

36
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
It's kind of nice.

37
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
The T-shirt is pretty.

38
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
It's colorful and nice.

39
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Everyone looks like they're having fun.

40
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Right?

41
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Who designed this?

42
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
It's a hobby that I want to hit.

43
00:01:41,000 --> 00:02:05,000
This program is brought to you by Sunluck, Oyama International Products, and the sponsor of this program.

44
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Ah.

45
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:25,000
It's lonely to be alone.

46
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Ah!

47
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Thank you.

48
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Mister.

49
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Who are you?

50
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I'm Rolling Thunder Man.

51
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Rolling Thunder Man?

52
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Yes.

53
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I didn't know that.

54
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
It might be impossible on Earth.

55
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Impossible?

56
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
What are you doing here?

57
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Do you know Peggy Seijin?

58
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Peggy Seijin?

59
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Yes.

60
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I heard that the evil Peggy Seijin is attacking the Earth.

61
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:19,000
If you leave it like this, the people on Earth will get hit by Peggy Seijin.

62
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
What?

63
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I came here to protect this beautiful Earth.

64
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Are you okay?

65
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I'm okay.

66
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Peggy Seijin is coming.

67
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I don't know if Peggy Seijin is looking at you.

68
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
You can't do anything.

69
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I'm still a child.

70
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I see.

71
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Be careful.

72
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Thank you.

73
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
See you.

74
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I'm Rolling Thunder Man.

75
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
You are a strange man.

76
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:09,000
This is from Isojima.

77
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:19,000
It won't open.

78
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Uncle.

79
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Yes.

80
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
What?

81
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
It won't open.

82
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
What?

83
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
The lid from Isojima.

84
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
It's Peggy Seijin's doing.

85
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Is it true?

86
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
What a terrible thing.

87
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I'm okay.

88
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Thank you, uncle.

89
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
What a terrible thing.

90
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
You can't do anything.

91
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
What?

92
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
You can't do anything.

93
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I'm tired from M36.

94
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I don't know that.

95
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Be careful.

96
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Thank you, uncle.

97
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Yes.

98
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Uncle.

99
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
What?

100
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I'm scared of Peggy Seijin.

101
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Shut up.

102
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Rolling Thunder Man Mimi.

103
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
You can't do anything.

104
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Mimi?

105
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Peggy Seijin said something bad about you.

106
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I didn't do anything.

107
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
You don't have to say something bad.

108
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I heard that Peggy Seijin said something bad about you.

109
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Really?

110
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,000
If you don't say anything, Peggy Seijin will pull your hair.

111
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Do something, uncle.

112
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I'm scared.

113
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Where are you, Peggy Seijin?

114
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Peggy Seijin.

115
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Rolling Thunder Man Mimi.

116
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
You can't do anything.

117
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
You can't do anything.

118
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Peggy Seijin is coming here.

119
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Peggy Seijin.

120
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
What are you talking about?

121
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
What are you talking about, uncle?

122
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,000
If you don't say anything, Rolling Thunder Man...

123
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Are you thinking about it?

124
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Yes.

125
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I have a good idea.

126
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
What is it?

127
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Don't worry.

128
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Even if Peggy Seijin attacks, I will defeat him with Rolling Thunder Man.

129
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
You can defeat him.

130
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Yes.

131
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Uncle, can you live with me?

132
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I live alone.

133
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Are you sure?

134
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Yes.

135
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Please live with me, uncle.

136
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Let's do that.

137
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Let's live together.

138
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Yes.

139
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Then three years passed.

140
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I'm back.

141
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Hey.

142
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Hey.

143
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
What are you doing?

144
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Why are you taking off your pants?

145
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
What?

146
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
What are you doing?

147
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
You are alone.

148
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Don't do that.

149
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I'm not doing anything.

150
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Something stinks.

151
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
What?

152
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Clean up the room.

153
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I feel sick recently.

154
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Are you on the side of justice?

155
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Only at the beginning.

156
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Let's live together.

157
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
At the beginning, I was nervous.

158
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
What are you doing?

159
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Why are you taking off your pants?

160
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
What?

161
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
What?

162
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Clean up the room.

163
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I don't want to do that.

164
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
It's your job.

165
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Don't touch me.

166
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I've changed.

167
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
At the beginning, I was kind.

168
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Why were you kind?

169
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
You don't do anything at home.

170
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Do your job.

171
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Stop it.

172
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Do your job.

173
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I hate you.

174
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I hate you.

175
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I hate you.

176
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
What?

177
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
What?

178
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Go home.

179
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
What?

180
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Go home?

181
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Where are you going?

182
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
What?

183
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
When will the Peggy Seijin come?

184
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
What?

185
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
When will the Peggy Seijin come?

186
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I told you three years ago.

187
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Rolling Thunder Gate.

188
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
It's coming soon.

189
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
When will it come?

190
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
It's been three years.

191
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
You lied.

192
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
That's not true.

193
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
The Peggy Seijin is not coming at all.

194
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
The Peggy Seijin is late.

195
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
What are you talking about?

196
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Don't pull me.

197
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Do your job.

198
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
What is this?

199
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
What is this shirt?

200
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
You're dressed up.

201
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
It's the Rolling Thunder Store.

202
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
What?

203
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
What?

204
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
What is this?

205
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I can beat you.

206
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I can't stand it anymore.

207
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:24,000
If there is a Sadameshi in your house, it may be the Rolling Thunder Gate.

208
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:34,000
You reacted somehow.

209
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Let's go.

210
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,000
It's been a long time since I did this.

211
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,000
This is the first time this year.

212
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
This is the second time.

213
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
This is the second time?

214
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Yes.

215
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
You're lying.

216
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Really?

217
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
This is the second time?

218
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Yes.

219
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
This is the first time.

220
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Really?

221
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Yes.

222
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
You didn't have to do it today.

223
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
You didn't have to do it at this time.

224
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
You didn't have to go back to Osaka right after this.

225
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Really?

226
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Yes.

227
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
But Kohaku was amazing.

228
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Yes.

229
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I can't believe it.

230
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Which one was it?

231
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
What?

232
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
People who watch TV know it.

233
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I can't believe that Tetsuya Takeda ran out of Pritin.

234
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
That was in Sendai.

235
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I was surprised.

236
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
That's why it was a little late to mosaic.

237
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I was surprised.

238
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
But which one did you win?

239
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
What?

240
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Which one did you win?

241
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
This year, you know.

242
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Shirofumi won.

243
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Let's bet.

244
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
What?

245
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Let's bet.

246
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
What?

247
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Which one did you win?

248
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
You're making fun of me.

249
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Let's bet.

250
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Okay.

251
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
What will you do if you lose?

252
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
You won't do the opening location alone.

253
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I don't want to do that.

254
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Today, you know.

255
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
The staff was wearing the T-shirt of Kiyoshi Ariyama.

256
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
The staff was wearing a T-shirt of Kiyoshi Ariyama.

257
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
The staff was wearing a T-shirt of Kiyoshi Ariyama.

258
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
The staff was wearing a T-shirt of Kiyoshi Ariyama.

259
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
And the bottom was like Gungnji Kawamata.

260
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Like a brief.

261
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
And the back was like this.

262
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
You lost.

263
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
And you put your pants on.

264
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
You wore this big pants of Gungnji.

265
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I was like Rolling Thunder Man.

266
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I don't see the reason.

267
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
It was blue.

268
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Shouka was wearing different pants.

269
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
One of them is called Nukui, and the other one is called Kawamada-kun.

270
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I mean, it's rude to call them pants.

271
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Why is it rude?

272
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
There must be some kind of problem.

273
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
What kind of problem do you have with white pants?

274
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Are you that amazing?

275
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
What kind of problem do you have?

276
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
It doesn't mean anything like that.

277
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
It's a bit yellowish.

278
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
White pants are always beautiful.

279
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Right?

280
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
That's not cool.

281
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Can you do it if you lose?

282
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I won't do it if I lose.

283
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
This is decided by Saito.

284
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:07,000
If you lose, you have to wear a suit like this in the back of Zoom-in Asa.

285
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:13,000
You have to wear a T-shirt and white pants.

286
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
You have to wear a suit like this in the back of Fukutome-san.

287
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
What do you think of this?

288
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Do you think I'm crazy?

289
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
It's early in the morning and it's hard.

290
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Oh, really?

291
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
If you lose...

292
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
You won't be able to get up in the morning.

293
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Which one of us won?

294
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Which one of us won?

295
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Let's make it clear.

296
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
If you lose, you have to wear a suit like this in the back of Zoom-in Asa.

297
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
In the back of Zoom-in Asa?

298
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Okay.

299
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Then let me say it first.

300
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Red pants.

301
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,000
If you say it so clearly, I want red pants, too.

302
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
This is Tuesday, right?

303
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I think it's really funny.

304
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Tuesday, right?

305
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I'll laugh in front of the TV.

306
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:54,000
If you say it so clearly, I'll laugh in the back of Zoom-in Asa at 7 or 8 in the morning.

307
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
So...

308
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
You have to get up in the morning.

309
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
It's hard, though.

310
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:08,000
This broadcast is on Tuesday, so if you lose, the next day, Wednesday morning.

311
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
You have to do it on Wednesday morning.

312
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:15,000
This year, I've been thinking about my activities as a downtown.

313
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
It's good to be on an amateur program.

314
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Is that so?

315
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
An amateur program, a viewer program...

316
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
But in the end, that's the only thing that makes sense.

317
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
If you lose, what are you going to do?

318
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Is it okay to say Zoom-in Asa?

319
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Or you can paint Mr. Wiki white.

320
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
There's something like that.

321
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
There is.

322
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
But I'm really thinking about it this year.

323
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I'm going to be on an amateur program.

324
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I'm not going to work at all.

325
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I'm going to be on my own.

326
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
You're going to apply like an amateur?

327
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I'm going to apply.

328
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
For example, what are you going to do?

329
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
What I'm thinking about right now is that...

330
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I'm going to be on KIN-CHAN NO KASO TAISYO.

331
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I'm going to apply.

332
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
That's right.

333
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
This is delicious.

334
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
You did it in the new year, didn't you?

335
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
You did it in the new year, didn't you?

336
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
There's still half a year to go.

337
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I'm thinking about that.

338
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
What are you going to do?

339
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I'm thinking about this.

340
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I'm going to do KAMELEON.

341
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
You're going to apply on KASO TAISYO, aren't you?

342
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Why do you do that in KAMELEON?

343
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
That's not what he's going to do.

344
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I'm going to apply on KAMELEON.

345
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
And I'll do the big mouth.

346
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Open your mouth wide.

347
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
You should apply on your tongue.

348
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Should I?

349
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Prepare a black and red cloth.

350
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I wrap it around my body.

351
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I wrap it around my tongue.

352
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I hold a stick with my left hand and put a fake fly on it.

353
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
While I was doing the Camelot, the fly got stuck on the other side.

354
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I grabbed the fly with the front of my hand and put it back with the back of my hand.

355
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
It's hard.

356
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
And I only have to say the line.

357
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
0.2 seconds.

358
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Can you do it?

359
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Where is this?

360
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:12,000
But I don't think I can do it until I pass the exam.

361
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Is that so?

362
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
In that case, you are one of Kin-chan's students, right?

363
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
That's right.

364
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I don't think a kid can get an A.

365
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
That's right.

366
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
So, if you do the Camelot and say, please come out, I'll do it like a kid.

367
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I'll do it like Yutako.

368
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I'll do it like Adokena.

369
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I'll do my best.

370
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I'll do my best.

371
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I'll do my best.

372
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I'll do my best.

373
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I'll do my best.

374
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I'll do my best.

375
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I think I can do it.

376
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Oh, really?

377
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I think I can do the Camelot.

378
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
But I don't have any special training.

379
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I'm the only one who can do it.

380
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Special training?

381
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I don't have a fly.

382
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:58,000
The fly was stabbed by Natsumi Ogawa.

383
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I asked, who grabbed the fly?

384
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
He said, Hamada.

385
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I'll do it until I get older.

386
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
So, what happened to your white hair?

387
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
What?

388
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I can't do it.

389
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
You can't do it?

390
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
You can't?

391
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
You can't?

392
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
You can't?

393
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I'll tell you why.

394
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
If you lose.

395
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
What happens if you lose?

396
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
What are you doing?

397
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Oh, I got it.

398
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
You should wear a furus.

399
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I don't want to wear a furus.

400
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I don't want to wear a furus.

401
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
What are you going to do?

402
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I'll do the Shogun of China.

403
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Oh, this is a different song.

404
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I'll sing Garara Nyororo.

405
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I'll sing Garara Nyororo at 10 in the morning.

406
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I'll go to Fukutomo.

407
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Bam!

408
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
The people who are watching this show,

409
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:04,000
they've been on this show for hours already.

410
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
It's hard, isn't it?

411
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
It's hard for the people who are watching this show.

412
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
But, well,

413
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I don't know the result of 31 days,

414
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:18,000
so I'll do my best.

415
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
It's okay.

416
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I understand.

417
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I'll do it.

418
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I'll do it when I lose.

419
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Right?

420
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Yes.

421
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
You're white, right?

422
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
It's red.

423
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Give me the red one.

424
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I don't want it.

425
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Well, I can see it.

426
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I'm doing it in the morning.

427
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I don't care about the time.

428
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I know what I'm doing.

429
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I don't care about it.

430
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Don't you have the same score as Kouhaku?

431
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I don't?

432
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I don't?

433
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I don't.

434
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I wish I had.

435
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
It's okay.

436
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I understand.

437
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
So, shall we go?

438
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Yes.

439
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Let's go to the post office.

440
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Oh, really?

441
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Don't kick the door.

442
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I want to do it.

443
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Do it properly.

444
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Don't kick the door.

445
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Even if I'm late for work,

446
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I'll do it properly.

447
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Don't do that.

448
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Don't be late.

449
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I'm counting on you.

450
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Okay.

451
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I'll do it properly in the ending.

452
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Give me a minute.

453
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
He doesn't want to do it.

454
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
This is amazing.

455
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Look at this.

456
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Kouhaku has worn this much before.

457
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
After Kouhaku's marriage announcement,

458
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
he has worn only this much.

459
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
This is a new way of doing things.

460
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Today, Kouhaku's girlfriend

461
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
came to the post office.

462
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
She came to the post office.

463
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Oh, really?

464
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Yes.

465
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I think I know whether it's red or white.

466
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Red.

467
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
See?

468
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
It's red.

469
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Who do you think it is?

470
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Wait a minute.

471
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Let's ask the staff at the post office.

472
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I think red is Kouhaku's favorite color.

473
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
White is Kouhaku's favorite color.

474
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
See?

475
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
I'll remember that it's white.

476
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
So, do it properly.

477
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Why don't you do it?

478
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
You should do it.

479
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Why don't you go out with her?

480
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Don't say dangerous things.

481
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Let me introduce her.

482
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
It's been a long time.

483
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Why do you say such things?

484
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Mariko Wada.

485
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Don't say it.

486
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I won't leave you alone.

487
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I'm on TV.

488
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Don't say it.

489
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Harashi Sagami, Kanagawa Prefecture.

490
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Where is it?

491
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Oono Sagami.

492
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I'll stop here.

493
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
You have a great academic record.

494
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Are you a junior high school graduate?

495
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
I'm a junior high school graduate.

496
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
You don't have to aim for it.

497
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Thank you for coming today.

498
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Thank you very much.

499
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Let me introduce Harashi.

500
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Her pen name is Piko.

501
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Good evening.

502
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Congratulations, Harashi.

503
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,000
The other day, you made the ultimate choice.

504
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
I made the ultimate choice on this show.

505
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Which do you like better, the name Nanashi or Piyopiyomaru?

506
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
At that time, you said Piyopiyomaru was better.

507
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I don't like Hama-chan.

508
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
I like P-chan.

509
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
That's enough.

510
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Don't be stubborn.

511
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
I'm not that stubborn.

512
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I thought about it at that time.

513
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
What is Piyopiyomaru?

514
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
When you said Piyopiyomaru, which do you like better?

515
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
I thought about it in my head.

516
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
That's why I like P-chan.

517
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
I don't think so.

518
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I don't think so.

519
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Don't say such things.

520
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I'm looking forward to it.

521
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
In about 5 hours, the Shogun of Hamada-san will be here.

522
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I don't know if you're a Shogun or not.

523
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Why do I say such nonsense?

524
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Is your schedule okay on Wednesday?

525
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
It's morning.

526
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
What?

527
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
It's morning.

528
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I see.

529
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
I don't have work from 7 o'clock.

530
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
You don't have work from 7 o'clock.

531
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
I don't have work from 7 o'clock.

532
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I don't have work from 7 o'clock.

533
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I'll definitely do it.

534
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
If I buy this, I'll go back to Osaka.

535
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
I saw it in Osaka.

536
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I'll go back to Osaka like Tamura Masakazu.

537
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
I don't mind looking at it from the side.

538
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Please.

539
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Please.

540
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Everyone is looking forward to it.

541
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
This will end at 2 o'clock.

542
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
About 10 minutes.

543
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
2 o'clock and 10 minutes.

544
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Well, about 5 hours later.

545
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Let's meet again.

546
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Well, let's meet 5 hours later behind Kutsume-san.

547
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Thank you very much.

548
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
It's fun.

549
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
The first time.

550
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Don't you feel like you've already won?

551
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,000
No, it's not like that.

552
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
5 hours later?

553
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:17,000
People who watch TV only know who has won and who has lost.

554
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
It's amazing.

555
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I don't know why I said such a thing.

556
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Let's go for now.

557
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
I'll go if I lose.

558
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:32,000
If I lose, I'm sorry.

559
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
What?

560
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
I'm thinking about the next new development.

561
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
I can't ride it.

562
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Idiot.

563
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
I'll never ride it.

564
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
You have to decide which one to ride.

565
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
I see.

566
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:50,000
I have to pretend to be a foreigner passing by.

567
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
What kind of person are you?

568
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I have to pass by when I go to the main subject.

569
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
I can't do that.

570
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
I have to ride a plane and chase.

571
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Idiot.

572
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Please think about it.

573
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Let's think about something new.

574
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:09,000
I'm still in the hope of winning.

575
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
You saw it.

576
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
I have to write a letter.

577
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Is that so?

578
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Please don't do that.

579
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
I want to see it.

580
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
I have to write a letter.

581
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
And the place.

582
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Please do it here.

583
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Please come to my dorm.

584
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
I have to write a letter.

585
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I'll do it here.

586
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
I'll do it.

587
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Please look forward to it.

588
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
I'll write a letter here.

589
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
See you in 5 hours.
