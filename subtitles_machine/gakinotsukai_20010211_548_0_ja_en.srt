1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Matsumoto vs. Hamada Team. 50m revenge match.

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
This program is brought to you by the following sponsors.

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:28,000
On the day of the match, the Hamada team is on the scene.

4
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
We're here.

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
We're here.

6
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I want to swim lightly and decide the order of the match.

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I've never seen this before.

8
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I want to win in that order.

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
That's true.

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
That's what everyone wants.

11
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Let's do it.

12
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
It's okay.

13
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
He's really good at swimming.

14
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
That's strange.

15
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
You didn't swim much when you were in middle school.

16
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I did.

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
And a little later, Matsumoto is on the scene.

18
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
This way, please.

19
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Thank you.

20
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I don't want to lose.

21
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I don't want to lose.

22
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I don't want to lose.

23
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Are you hungry before the match?

24
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Yes, I'm hungry.

25
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I've prepared something for you.

26
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
That's amazing.

27
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
That's amazing.

28
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
That's amazing.

29
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
That's amazing.

30
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Let's eat.

31
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Let's eat.

32
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Let's eat.

33
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
That's amazing.

34
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Matsumoto.

35
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I woke up early and made this.

36
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I didn't make it.

37
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
For the sake of victory.

38
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I'm sorry.

39
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I'm sorry.

40
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I woke up early and made this.

41
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I woke up early and made this.

42
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
You can see it at this point.

43
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
It's not that easy.

44
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
It's not that easy.

45
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
It's not that bad.

46
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
It's not that bad.

47
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
It's finally time for the match.

48
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
It's finally time for the match.

49
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
It looks like a match.

50
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
That's right.

51
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
That's right.

52
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I had to drink hot water.

53
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I can't drink hot water.

54
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
That's a lie.

55
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I asked Fujiwara to pack my luggage.

56
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
That's a match.

57
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I can only do it once.

58
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I can only do it once.

59
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I can only do it once.

60
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I thought about it when we arrived.

61
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I thought about it when we arrived.

62
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I want to get revenge in the previous order.

63
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I want to get revenge in the previous order.

64
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I don't know how much I can swim.

65
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I'm sorry, but I'd like to borrow this pool.

66
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I'd like to borrow this pool.

67
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I'd like to show you a little bit.

68
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I'll take a picture of it.

69
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I won't support you at all.

70
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I'll show you a little bit.

71
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I'll show you a little bit.

72
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I'm the only one who's happy.

73
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I'll show you a little bit.

74
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Time is not in my picture.

75
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Please shorten it as much as possible.

76
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I always tell Suga.

77
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
You should have said anything.

78
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
You are an annoying person.

79
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Can I get in touch?

80
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I'm a little upset with this catch copy.

81
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I'm a little upset with this catch copy.

82
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
This is the Tobiu that I gave birth to.

83
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
This is the Tobiu that I gave birth to.

84
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
This is a star of Shikoku.

85
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
This is a star of Shikoku.

86
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
This is not Shikoku.

87
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Yamanaki was born in Nishinomiya, isn't it?

88
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Yes, it is.

89
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Tanaka was born in Hiroyuki, isn't it?

90
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Toyonaka was born in Wakahakegappa, isn't it?

91
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
To be honest, I'm a little dazed.

92
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Even though I've been saying it for a long time.

93
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I don't think it's a cheer.

94
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I'm a little dazed.

95
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I was born in Katsushoku, which Yoshimoto is proud of.

96
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Toyonaka was born in Wakahakegappa, isn't it?

97
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I don't like that hill.

98
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Well, then show me a little.

99
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
All right.

100
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Thank you very much.

101
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Before the showdown.

102
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,000
First of all, practice, including swimming checks.

103
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Zaki-san.

104
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Hey.

105
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Yes.

106
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
It's about 5 minutes with a cap.

107
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
You'd better get ready.

108
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
You'd better come out.

109
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
You'd better come out.

110
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
You'd better come out, En-chan.

111
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
It's a huge belly.

112
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
What's this belly?

113
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
It's terrible.

114
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Zaki-san.

115
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I'm not supposed to say that.

116
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Get ready.

117
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
And then swim a little.

118
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Look at that.

119
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Yeah.

120
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Yes.

121
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Get ready.

122
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Start.

123
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
How is it?

124
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Let's go.

125
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:49,000
It's a little fast, isn't it?

126
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Start and end.

127
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Yes.

128
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Let's go.

129
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Yes.

130
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
It's fast.

131
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Fast.

132
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Fast.

133
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Fast.

134
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
It's fast.

135
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
It's so fast.

136
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
It's so fast.

137
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
It's so fast.

138
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
It's so fast.

139
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
It's so fast.

140
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
You were faster when you were about to die than when you were going that way.

141
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I'm not going to the side.

142
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Are you sure?

143
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Hey, hey, hey.

144
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
If you hang your legs,

145
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I'll win.

146
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Eh? Who?

147
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I will.

148
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Eh?

149
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
It hurts a lot.

150
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I feel sorry for you.

151
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
If you don't hang your legs,

152
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
you can move your body.

153
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I'll do that.

154
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
But if you hang your legs,

155
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
do you have a draw?

156
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
No, I don't have a draw.

157
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
That means you lose.

158
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Ah, I see.

159
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Then, I'll hang one of your legs.

160
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Let's do that.

161
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I'll hang one of your legs.

162
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I'll hang one of your legs.

163
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I'll hang one of your legs.

164
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I'm scared of hanging my legs.

165
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Ah,

166
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
now,

167
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
all of you didn't hang your legs, did you?

168
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I'll do it once.

169
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I won't do it.

170
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Do you want to go to the gym?

171
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I don't want to do it at that distance.

172
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
But I can't do it.

173
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
This is

174
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
dangerous.

175
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I knew it.

176
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I knew it.

177
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Now,

178
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
the team is practicing.

179
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I'll call a special coach.

180
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
The lifesaver,

181
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Inuma-sensei!

182
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
He's coming.

183
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Ah,

184
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
it's cold.

185
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
It's cold.

186
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
It's cold.

187
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Hey,

188
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
don't lie down.

189
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Don't lie down.

190
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Hey,

191
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Hey,

192
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
it's cold.

193
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
It's cold.

194
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Pro lifesaver,

195
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Inuma-sensei.

196
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
He is the first person

197
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
in the Japan Lifesaving Association

198
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
who has won 4 times in a row

199
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
in the Ironman race.

200
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Inuma-sensei

201
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
will be the coach of the Hamada team.

202
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I'll do my best.

203
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I'll ask Inuma-sensei

204
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
to teach you.

205
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Then,

206
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
let's practice.

207
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Let's go.

208
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
This way.

209
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
No, no, no.

210
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
What about us?

211
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I've been thinking about it since then.

212
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Maybe I should be the second one.

213
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
What?

214
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
The second one?

215
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I think I should be the first one

216
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
from the beginning.

217
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I think I should be the second one.

218
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Then,

219
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I think I should be the last one.

220
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I think I should be the last one.

221
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Let's go.

222
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Inuma-sensei.

223
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Inuma-sensei, let's go.

224
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Who is it?

225
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Inuma-sensei.

226
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Inuma-sensei.

227
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I'm sorry.

228
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I'm a very secretive person.

229
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Who is the first one?

230
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Yes.

231
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Who is the first one?

232
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
The first one is Kenji.

233
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Kenji.

234
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
First of all,

235
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
the best thing is to lose your balance.

236
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
When you kick the wall,

237
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
you usually look forward,

238
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
but if you look forward,

239
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
you will lose your balance.

240
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I see.

241
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
It's the same as here.

242
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Look down.

243
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
It's too cold.

244
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
It's too cold.

245
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
It's too cold.

246
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
It hurts.

247
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
It hurts.

248
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
What's that?

249
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I thought I could do it.

250
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I thought I could do it.

251
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I thought I could do it.

252
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
That's...

253
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Inuma-sensei.

254
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I thought I could do it.

255
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Ready...

256
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Go!

257
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Be careful.

258
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I'm sorry.

259
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
It's too fast.

260
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I lost my balance.

261
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I saw their strategy.

262
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I saw their strategy.

263
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
They didn't want to go too far.

264
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
They couldn't do it at that distance.

265
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I couldn't do it.

266
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I couldn't do it at that distance.

267
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I couldn't do it.

268
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I couldn't do it.

269
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I quit.

270
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I quit.

271
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I'll change for sure.

272
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I'll change for sure.

273
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
For example,

274
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
it's a long kick.

275
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
It's a start.

276
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
It's a start.

277
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
What do you do with this momentum?

278
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
What do you do with this momentum?

279
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
It's like this.

280
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
You can go to the other side.

281
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
You can go to the other side.

282
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
You're great.

283
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I'm sorry.

284
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I'm sorry.

285
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I'm sorry.

286
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I'm sorry.

287
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I can't go up.

288
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I can't go up.

289
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I thought you were going to do something.

290
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I thought you were going to do something.

291
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
It's a touch.

292
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
It's very different from the last one.

293
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
It's very different from the last one.

294
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
It's very different from the last one.

295
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
It would be fun if I won.

296
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
It's fun.

297
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
They definitely think they're going to win.

298
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
They definitely think they're going to win.

299
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
48 hours.

300
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Every time, every time.

301
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Break time before the game.

302
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Look at this guy. He's so skinny.

303
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
If you're in the ocean, you're a f***ing sea monster.

304
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
You're popular, aren't you?

305
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
You're popular, aren't you?

306
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Of course, I am.

307
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Are you an idiot?

308
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:36,000
You said you were second, but I'm third.

309
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I don't understand what you're saying.

310
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:46,000
One, two, three, four, five...

311
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Wait a minute.

312
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Six, seven...

313
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Who are you?

314
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Who are you?

315
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Who are you?

316
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I'm Jun Okuri.

317
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
What are you doing today?

318
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I'm going to swim with everyone.

319
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I'm bored.

320
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
With the boss and the four of us.

321
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I'm not bored.

322
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I'm waiting for you to go up there.

323
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Let's do it.

324
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Can I give you another one?

325
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Ah, it's mango

326
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Mango?

327
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Mango or...

328
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Lychee! Lychee!

329
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Lychee! Lychee!

330
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Lychee!

331
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
But...

332
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Huh?

333
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
What is that?

334
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Huh?

335
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
It's like poison

336
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
It's like poison?

337
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
But you know...

338
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
If you don't stay away from the person next to you...

339
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Hey!

340
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
It's not good for the weather

341
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Hey!

342
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I'm going to win if you say that

343
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
What are you talking about?

344
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I'm going to win, right?

345
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Huh?

346
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
He cried

347
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
He cried

348
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
He cried

349
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
The day Matsumoto-san cried

350
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I cried

351
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Let's review the rules

352
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
The opponent is a 10-metre tall guy

353
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Matsumoto is 50-metre tall by himself

354
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
The Kamada team is 12.5-metre tall each

355
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
The key point is the touch of the Kamada team

356
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
How will the four of them cover the unaccelerated boss?

357
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Just like the practice

358
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
The start and dash earlier was good

359
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Thank you

360
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Please do it in the actual game

361
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Tanaka-kun

362
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
You did a good run

363
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Just like that

364
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Touch Endo

365
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Endo

366
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Don't sink

367
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I won't do anything

368
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Just come as it is

369
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Let's do our best

370
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Let's go

371
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Thank you

372
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I won't do anything

373
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
It's finally time for the battle

374
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Matsumoto and the Kamada team's determination and pride

375
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
In the depths of their eyes, quietly

376
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
But with a hot head

377
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
They release the tension in their muscles

378
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Will the Kamada team get revenge from their humiliation?

379
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Is it a glorious goal to wait before their eyes?

380
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Or is it a nightmare punishment game?

381
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
The answer is the water of God

382
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Please wait

383
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Yes

384
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Let's go

385
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Yes

386
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Let's go

387
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
On your marks

388
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Get set

389
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Let's go

390
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Matsumoto and the Kamada team's determination and pride

391
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Matsumoto and the Kamada team's determination and pride

392
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
It's still going

393
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
It's still going

394
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Matsumoto and the Kamada team's determination and pride

395
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Wait a minute

396
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Thank you

397
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
We did it

398
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Thank you

399
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
One more time

400
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
What the hell are you doing?

401
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I dropped it

402
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Don't talk

403
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Don't look

404
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Yes

405
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
This is strange

406
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
It's cold

407
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
That's strange

408
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Do you want to go out?

409
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
If you get tired, go out

410
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Wait a minute

411
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Let's go

412
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Thank you

413
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
We did it

414
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
We won

415
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
It's cold

416
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
We did it

417
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
We won!

418
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Are you guys still comedians?

419
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
We won!

420
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Comedians!

421
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Comedians!

422
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
What are you going to do if you swim seriously?

423
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Idiot!

424
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I'm not an idiot!

425
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Hey, you guys!

426
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Idiot!

427
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
What are you doing?

428
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Are you trying to get into the water?

429
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Idiot!

430
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Are you serious?

431
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Left, right, left.

432
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Left, left, left.

433
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Idiot!

434
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Did you win?

435
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
We finally won.

436
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
I don't like that kind of punishment game.

437
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
What kind of punishment game is it?

438
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
No matter who asks,

439
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
even if they say it was funny,

440
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
it doesn't matter.

441
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
What was funny?

442
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
If we did it,

443
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
we would have really died.

444
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
No, no, no.

445
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
But, you know,

446
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I'm sorry.

447
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
But, you know,

448
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
what I'm looking forward to

449
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
is the actual game.

450
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I'm going to play seriously from now on.

451
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
I'm going to play seriously from now on.

452
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
I'm going to play seriously from now on.

453
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
I'm going to play seriously from now on.

454
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Thank you for watching.

455
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Thank you for watching.

456
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Thank you for watching.

457
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Thank you for watching.

458
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
If we have a chance,

459
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
we can play a punishment game.

460
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
This time,

461
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
we will play a punishment game

462
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
until the summer.

463
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Of course.

464
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
We will make fun of some jokes

465
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
and make it fun.

466
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
We will make fun of some jokes

467
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
and make it fun.

468
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
We will make fun of some jokes

469
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
and make it fun.

470
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
I can't do it.

471
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:46,000
I can't do it.
