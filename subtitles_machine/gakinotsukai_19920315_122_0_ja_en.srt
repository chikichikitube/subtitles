1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Oogiri Dai is here!

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Recently, when I'm walking around town, people ask me,

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Who's the Gorilla Man?

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Who's the Gorilla Man?

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm often asked this question.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Is there anyone who knows who the Gorilla Man is?

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I don't think so.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Unfortunately, I can't answer this question.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Today, we have the Oogiri Dai.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm your host, Hamada Masatoshi.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Let's get started!

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Hanashikas, please come on stage!

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
First, please introduce yourself.

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Recently, when I was walking down the street,

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I met Mr. Takamida of ALFIE.

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
He is the world's...

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Shut up!

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Yamasaki Hosei.

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Next, please introduce yourself.

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
In Hamada-san's bedroom,

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Ikumi-chan found something and spoke for the first time.

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Baibu...

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Team Zero, please come on stage.

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Nice to meet you.

25
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I'm Hamada Masatoshi.

26
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
What do you want to do?

27
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Sometimes, I want to cheat.

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Shut up!

29
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Spring has come.

30
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
In April, I left my job in downtown,

31
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
and spring has come to my life.

32
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I'm the manager, Nitta.

33
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Nice to meet you.

34
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Lastly, when I was walking down the street,

35
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I met Mr. Takamida of ALFIE.

36
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
He is the world's...

37
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Shut up!

38
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Next, please introduce yourself.

39
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I'm Ayu Eo.

40
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Please say one word at a time.

41
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
While saying that word,

42
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
please introduce yourself.

43
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
What do you want to say?

44
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I...

45
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
...am...

46
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Hey!

47
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
What's wrong with you?

48
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Give me that.

49
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I'm doing medicine.

50
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Give it to me.

51
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
What do you mean by doing medicine?

52
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I thought you were going to continue.

53
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Fine.

54
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
The old man was a bit surprised just now.

55
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Now, let's do the other ones.

56
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Ra!

57
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Ra!

58
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Ra!

59
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Ra!

60
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Ra-ri-ru-re-ro!

61
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Now, let's go.

62
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Ra!

63
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Ra!

64
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Ra!

65
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,000
It's fun to be blowing the trumpet, but...

66
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Hey!

67
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Hey!

68
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Hey, Yamazaki-san!

69
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Yes?

70
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
What are you doing?

71
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
You're blowing the trumpet!

72
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Well, you're a shy bastard.

73
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Ri!

74
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I want to hide Ryu's tattoo.

75
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I don't have it!

76
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Ra-ri-ru!

77
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I don't have enough money to buy a ruby.

78
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Re!

79
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I like racing more than rice.

80
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I like racing more than rice.

81
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Ro!

82
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
London boots.

83
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
It hurts.

84
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Yasu-san, why did you say London boots?

85
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Yasu-san, why did you say London boots?

86
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Ah, you didn't know?

87
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I didn't know!

88
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Let's stop doing that kind of stuff.

89
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Now, let's continue.

90
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Please get ready.

91
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Now, let's do the Oricomi-Utagashi battle!

92
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Now, the Oricomi-Utagashi battle.

93
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:29,000
There are a lot of things you can buy in the market.

94
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Let's sing while doing the Oricomi-Utagashi battle.

95
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Oricomi-Utagashi battle.

96
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Okay?

97
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
The music will start.

98
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Let's dance together.

99
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Raise your hand if you're ready.

100
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Now, let's do the Oricomi-Utagashi battle.

101
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Ready, go!

102
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Hurry up!

103
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
It's a corner like this.

104
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Why do you keep dancing in the middle of the corner?

105
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I'm tired.

106
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Sing!

107
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Sorry, sorry.

108
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Thank you.

109
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Let's go, Oricomi-Utagashi battle.

110
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Oricomi-Utagashi battle.

111
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Ready, go!

112
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
What are you going to do?

113
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I'm going to do the Tawashi dance.

114
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Tawashi dance?

115
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Let's go!

116
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
You're just going to do the Tawashi dance, aren't you?

117
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Just like that!

118
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Let's go!

119
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Ready, go!

120
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Now, what are you going to do?

121
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I'm going to dance.

122
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Just like that!

123
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Just like that!

124
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Let's do the Tara dance.

125
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Tara!

126
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Ready, go!

127
00:05:53,000 --> 00:06:18,000
No matter what you do, everyone is dancing.

128
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Just like that!

129
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Now, let's do the Tara dance.

130
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
You do the Hoya dance.

131
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
You do the Oka dance.

132
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Tara!

133
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Tawashi!

134
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Now, what are you going to do?

135
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I'm going to do the Kisawa dance.

136
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Kisawa dance!

137
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Now, what are you going to do?

138
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I'm going to do the cucumber and papaya dance.

139
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:37,000
You do the cucumber and papaya dance.

140
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
What are you saying?

141
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Now, let's do the last one.

142
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
The last one!

143
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I'm going to dance with someone's joke.

144
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Okay!

145
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I'm going to dance with someone's joke.

146
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I'm going to dance with someone's joke.

147
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:32,000
It's a nice day today.

148
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Ladies and gentlemen.

149
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Hello.

150
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Now, let's talk about something.

151
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
What?

152
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Recently, you've been busy with work and you don't have your own private time.

153
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Your voice is too loud.

154
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I'm right next to you.

155
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I don't have my private time.

156
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
If you have a chance to hang out,

157
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
If you have a chance to hang out,

158
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I'll arrange a party for you.

159
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Even if I say I finished early today, it's already 12 o'clock.

160
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
It's already 12 o'clock.

161
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
The next day was really early.

162
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
The next day was already 6 or 7 o'clock.

163
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:20,000
It was already 6 or 7 o'clock.

164
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I didn't feel safe anymore.

165
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:43,580
I received my makeup

166
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:46,580
When I was about to go to sleep, Miku put his bra on.

167
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:49,580
He's been wearing his bra since 6 in the morning.

168
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:53,580
He used to do it like this, but recently he's gotten used to it, and he's stopped here.

169
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:58,580
I don't want to see him like that anymore.

170
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:03,580
I've become able to do it like this.

171
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:06,580
What do you think of me?

172
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:12,580
I didn't watch yesterday's on-air.

173
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:14,580
I didn't watch it either.

174
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,580
I didn't watch it either.

175
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:23,580
If you keep doing that, you'll be kicked out of the entertainment world.

176
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:25,580
I'm just saying what I saw.

177
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:28,580
You were dancing, weren't you?

178
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:30,580
That's what's wrong with you.

179
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:34,580
Normally, two people follow each other and one person says something.

180
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:36,580
Like, hey, hey.

181
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:38,580
Stop it. Stop it.

182
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:40,580
I don't think so.

183
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:42,580
What are you talking about?

184
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:44,580
It's a twin-turbo.

185
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:49,580
I won't lose either.

186
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:51,580
No, that's not it.

187
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:54,580
Two people follow each other.

188
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:57,580
The audience is more excited.

189
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:59,580
Hey, hey.

190
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:02,580
What's so great about saying, hey?

191
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:04,580
Stop it.

192
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,580
Stop it.

193
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:09,580
Two people follow each other.

194
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:12,580
If one person says something, the other follows.

195
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:14,580
I don't think so.

196
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:16,580
I don't look like that.

197
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:19,580
How are you feeling lately?

198
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:21,580
My health?

199
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:23,580
Well, it's the same as usual.

200
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:26,580
My neck, my back, everything.

201
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:28,580
I'm tired.

202
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:34,580
Your body is a little weird, isn't it?

203
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:37,580
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

204
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:39,580
It's a little weird.

205
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:43,580
Normally, if a human has a body, it stretches out and has a neck and a face.

206
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:45,580
You're like this.

207
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,580
My posture is bad.

208
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:51,580
Your neck is sticking out like this.

209
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:52,580
This is...

210
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:54,580
My posture is bad.

211
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:56,580
I usually do this.

212
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:58,580
It's like this, isn't it?

213
00:11:58,580 --> 00:11:59,580
Yes, it is.

214
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:01,580
If you stretch out your neck, it's like this.

215
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:02,580
That's right.

216
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:06,580
You shouldn't be doing this all the time.

217
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:08,580
You look like you're proud.

218
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:11,580
I think I'm proud enough every day.

219
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:14,580
That's my shoulder.

220
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:15,580
I think so, too.

221
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:17,580
That's not it.

222
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:21,580
By the way, I've been feeling a little sick lately.

223
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:22,580
By the way?

224
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:24,580
What's that got to do with it?

225
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:26,580
My body is like this because my posture is bad.

226
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,580
By the way, I have constipation.

227
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:30,580
What's that got to do with it?

228
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:34,580
That's why I'm telling you that I haven't lost to you yet.

229
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:37,580
I'm so frustrated.

230
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:39,580
There's something like that.

231
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:43,580
There's jealousy for someone who has a disease like that.

232
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:44,580
No.

233
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:45,580
There is.

234
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:47,580
That's not healthy.

235
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:48,580
That's right.

236
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:51,580
That's right, but there's a shadow somewhere.

237
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:54,580
There's something I admire about that.

238
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:57,580
You don't have a shadow, but you're creepy enough.

239
00:12:57,580 --> 00:13:01,580
There was something called Okita Soshi.

240
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:02,580
He had a blood clot.

241
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:03,580
He had a blood clot.

242
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:05,580
There's a cool picture of him.

243
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:06,580
That's right.

244
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:08,580
I want to get sick, too.

245
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:09,580
constipation.

246
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,580
It's the first time I've had a constipation.

247
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:12,580
It's tough.

248
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:14,580
How many days?

249
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:15,580
How many days?

250
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:16,580
I used to...

251
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:18,580
I had two days a day.

252
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:20,580
I didn't even have one day.

253
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:23,580
I had a few days a day.

254
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:24,580
Really?

255
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:26,580
I have a lot of constipation.

256
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:28,580
If you ask me how much I have.

257
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:29,580
That's amazing.

258
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:31,580
It's a secret.

259
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:33,580
I have to move about four times a day.

260
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:34,580
That's right.

261
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:37,580
But each time is a serious battle.

262
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:38,580
I have a lot of constipation.

263
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:40,580
It's like a buffalo.

264
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:43,580
I've never seen a buffalo.

265
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:45,580
I don't know what kind of buffalo it is.

266
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:47,580
I don't have one, but it's a secret.

267
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:49,580
It's a dirty buffalo.

268
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:51,580
It's like a buffalo.

269
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,580
Each time is a serious battle.

270
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:55,580
I don't have one, but it's a serious battle.

271
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:57,580
What kind of face do you have when you have a constipation?

272
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:02,580
I don't have one at all.

273
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:03,580
There are times when it hurts.

274
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:04,580
Yes.

275
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:05,580
When it's hard.

276
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:07,580
You're a shy bastard.

277
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:09,580
When he's a shy bastard.

278
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:12,580
I want to see his face, but I'm shy.

279
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:13,580
I'm shy.

280
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:14,580
It's hard to come out like this.

281
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:15,580
I can't come out.

282
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:16,580
I can't come out.

283
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:17,580
I can't come out.

284
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:19,580
I look at you like this.

285
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:21,580
You look like a daughter of the one who went to the wedding.

286
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:22,580
Yes.

287
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:23,580
I look at you like this.

288
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:31,580
When I have a constipation, I clench my teeth.

289
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:35,580
I have a lot of constipation this time.

290
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:37,580
I can't come out, but I can't come out.

291
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:38,580
I can't come out.

292
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:39,580
I can't come out.

293
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:40,580
I can't come out.

294
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:43,580
When I went to the wedding, I said,

295
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:48,580
But I didn't hear anything after I said that.

296
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:51,580
You're a nobody.

297
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:52,580
You're a nobody.

298
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:56,580
That's right.

299
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:59,580
I'm not dependable, but I'm dependable.

300
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:02,580
I see.

301
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:03,580
Really.

302
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:08,580
He must be in a hurry.

303
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:09,580
He's a tough guy.

304
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:10,580
He is.

305
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:16,520
You head to a mamajan'sه wall and then have to pose like this!

306
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,160
weißalties can't raise their hips?

307
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,500
They can't, yes.

308
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,920
Should we keep Appai it to grab on to the other tambanist?

309
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,000
The experienced tamanist could use a phew to hold him up.

310
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,180
Yeah, like, that's what Glennum meant.

311
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:29,240
Well, basically what you need is to do this gesture and then when you lift your hips.

312
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:31,040
What a useless gesture.

313
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,180
The sir looks happy and registered, though!

314
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:35,540
Alright, are we ready to roll?

315
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:36,980
Stop pushing your legs!

316
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:39,980
You know, like a little Koshikin-chan,

317
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,980
it's like, click, click, like that, right?

318
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:43,980
Like, go away!

319
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:46,980
It's like that, right?

320
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,980
Like this, with the hair like this.

321
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:54,980
Ah, that's it.

322
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:55,980
Yes, yes.

323
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:57,980
What do you want to do?

324
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:59,980
It's fine to write a letter like this.

325
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:02,980
That's amazing.

326
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:04,980
Ah, I see.

327
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:06,980
You know, I was thinking,

328
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:07,980
in the old days, you know,

329
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:08,980
there was a game called,

330
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:09,980
which one of you will win?

331
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:10,980
Yes, yes, yes.

332
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:11,980
How about that kind of thing?

333
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:13,980
Ah, the one where everyone gathers, right?

334
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:14,980
Yes.

335
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:17,980
Isn't that kind of interesting?

336
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:19,980
Gyo-san gathers everyone?

337
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:20,980
Yes.

338
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:21,980
That's it.

339
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:22,980
Defeating dominoes.

340
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:25,980
What? Defeating humans?

341
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:27,980
No, that's not it.

342
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:28,980
Ah, everyone gathers?

343
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:32,980
Yes, everyone gathers.

344
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:35,980
That's enough.

345
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:37,980
Everyone gathers dominoes, right?

346
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:39,980
That's boring.

347
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:41,980
But you don't like it,

348
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:43,980
that kind of skinship with fans, right?

349
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:44,980
What?

350
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:46,980
Are you going to tear it up?

351
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:49,980
Don't say things like that!

352
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:51,980
You're so annoying!

353
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:53,980
You know, when you're on location,

354
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:55,980
there's a location bus, right?

355
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:57,980
There's a film on it, right?

356
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:00,980
But the passengers stop and look at it.

357
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:02,980
So they stop and look at the location,

358
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:03,980
and when they're done looking,

359
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:04,980
we try to go back,

360
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:05,980
and get on the bus,

361
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:06,980
and from the other side,

362
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:07,980
you can probably see it,

363
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:08,980
but they're like,

364
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:10,980
Ah, Hama-chan, Hama-chan,

365
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:11,980
and they're doing that,

366
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:12,980
and in the bus,

367
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:13,980
they're like,

368
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:14,980
Let's take a look.

369
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:15,980
You're so annoying!

370
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:16,980
That kind of skinship with fans,

371
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:17,980
I'm going to tear it up!

372
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:20,980
You're so annoying!

373
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:21,980
You!

374
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:24,980
I'm going to return it to you!

375
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:25,980
Look at it! Look at it!

376
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:27,980
Look at it! Look at it!

377
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,980
There's a pig!

378
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:32,980
I'm going to tear it up!

379
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:34,980
You're so annoying!

380
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:35,980
Don't say things like that!

381
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:36,980
You're the one who's saying it!

382
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:37,980
You're the one who's saying it!

383
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:38,980
I'm going to find it!

384
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:39,980
I'm going to find it!

385
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:40,980
You're the one who's saying it!

386
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:42,980
Sometimes, when I wave my hand,

387
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:43,980
Hama-chan,

388
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:45,980
if I'm on the scene,

389
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:46,980
remember,

390
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:47,980
when I wave my hand,

391
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:49,980
I'm waving it like a fool.

392
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:50,980
Wait a minute!

393
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:51,980
Wait a minute!

394
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:52,980
That pig is like,

395
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:54,980
Uhhhhhh!

396
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:55,980
At first, I thought,

397
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:57,980
does he have a pig skin?

398
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:01,980
It's Tsutsumi-moto.

399
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:03,980
What's that?

400
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:05,980
Why do you keep saying his name?

401
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:07,980
No, he's Tsutsumi-moto.

402
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:09,980
That's right.

403
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:10,980
Why do you keep saying his name?

404
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:12,980
No, because I saw Tsutsumi-moto.

405
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:15,980
Hitoshi Aizu was looking at Tsutsumi-moto.

406
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:17,980
And then,

407
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:19,980
Hitoshi Aizu passed it on to Hitoshino.

408
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:20,980
You!

409
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:21,980
Did you get it?

410
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:22,980
Hitoshi Mouse.

411
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:24,980
Hitoshi Mouse.

412
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,980
I have a question for both of you.

413
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:31,980
When you see a suspicious person,

414
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:32,980
you say,

415
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:33,980
well,

416
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:34,980
right?

417
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,980
How suspicious can you be?

418
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:39,980
How can you tell if that person is suspicious?

419
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:40,980
Please tell me.

420
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:42,980
That's difficult, isn't it?

421
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:43,980
Well, yeah.

422
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:45,980
How suspicious can you be?

423
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:47,980
If you were in Hokkaido,

424
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:49,980
you'd think it's suspicious.

425
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:51,980
You'd think it's dark here.

426
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:52,980
You'd keep going like this,

427
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:54,980
taking time trips,

428
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:55,980
and when you do that,

429
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:57,980
you can call the police right away.

430
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:58,980
Right?

431
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:00,980
Other than that?

432
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:01,980
For example,

433
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:03,980
what would you do with a cape on?

434
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:06,980
That's a suspicious person!

435
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,980
This hand would have become a mecha.

436
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:12,980
It's not a suspicious person,

437
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:14,980
it's someone dangerous!

438
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:16,980
And then,

439
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:17,980
when you get home,

440
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:19,980
you'd go like this,

441
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:20,980
but you don't have any energy.

442
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:21,980
Yeah.

443
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:22,980
And then,

444
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:26,980
This is a telephone line.

445
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:31,980
What's that?

446
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:34,980
It looks like a centaur behind you.

447
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:36,980
Well, that's how it is.

448
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:38,980
It's perfectly like that.

449
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:39,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

450
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:41,980
It's properly made.

451
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:48,980
It's made of metal. It's made of rubber band.

452
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:52,980
I can't do this.

453
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:55,980
Let's do it all at once.

454
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:58,980
Take a memo of this.

455
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:00,980
I can't do this.

456
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:05,980
You said there would be a big earthquake on May 10th on TV.

457
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:07,980
Now?

458
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:08,980
Of course.

459
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:09,980
May 10th.

460
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:10,980
Really?

461
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:11,980
May 10th.

462
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:13,980
Well...

463
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:14,980
May 14th.

464
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:16,980
The 11th is Thursday.

465
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:17,980
Is it my birthday?

466
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:27,980
There's one thing I want to erase from my memory.

467
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:31,980
I think it's rude to say this, but...

468
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:38,980
For example, I can't remember my girlfriend or my family's birthday at all.

469
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:43,980
But your birthday is on May 11th, so I can't remember it.

470
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:46,980
I hate it.

471
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:47,980
Why?

472
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:51,980
I don't know why I can't remember it.

473
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:52,980
It's annoying.

474
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:54,980
What?

475
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:58,980
You should bring a present to the set at least once.

476
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:02,980
I'm not your boyfriend.

477
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:07,980
Do you buy something that looks good on you?

478
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:08,980
Do you buy something that looks good on you?

479
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:11,980
It's funny when I think about it.

480
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:15,980
When someone asks me if it's a present, I say yes.

481
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:18,980
That's why I have a ribbon.

482
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:26,980
I give it to you.

483
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:29,980
Can I take it?

484
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:30,980
Can I open it now?

485
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:36,980
When I play with Karu, their faces turn red.
