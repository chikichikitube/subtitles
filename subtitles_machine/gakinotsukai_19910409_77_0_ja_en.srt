1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Chuki Chuki Grandfather and Grandmother Zesture Battle!

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
This game is between Grandmother Matsumoto and Grandfather Hamada...

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Grandfather Hamada?

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
No, Grandfather Hamada.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Hamada and Grandfather Hamada?

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Hamada will be divided into two teams.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
They will compete for points with Zesture.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
It's a game just like the title.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I see, I understand.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The first question will be asked by Hamada-san.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Let's start the Zesture game!

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
It's a gorilla!

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It's a gorilla!

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
It's a gorilla!

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Don't look at it!

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
It's a gorilla!

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Stop it!

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
This is bad!

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
What are you doing?

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Don't make a voice!

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
What?

22
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
What are you doing?

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
You can't do it anymore.

24
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
No, don't make a voice!

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Don't make a voice!

26
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Let me put in only Ehehe.

27
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Only Ehehe?

28
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
If you put in only Ehehe, I won't be able to get into the mood.

29
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Stop it!

30
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Don't make a voice!

31
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Only Ehehe!

32
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Stop it!

33
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
What are you doing?

34
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Don't make a voice!

35
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
It's a bear!

36
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
What are you doing?

37
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Don't think about it!

38
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
The correct answer is a bear.

39
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
A bear?

40
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Yes.

41
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Oh my!

42
00:01:44,000 --> 00:02:00,000
This program is brought to you by these sponsors.

43
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Let's start!

44
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Don't make a voice!

45
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
What are you doing?

46
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Don't make a voice!

47
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
What are you doing?

48
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Don't make a voice!

49
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Don't make a voice!

50
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Don't make a voice!

51
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
No!

52
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Stop it!

53
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Stop it!

54
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
There is a bear inside!

55
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Stop it!

56
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Stop it!

57
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
It's a bear!

58
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
No!

59
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Don't make a voice!

60
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
It's hot!

61
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Don't make a voice!

62
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
It's hot!

63
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
It's a crab.

64
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
The next question is a VTR.

65
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
The Hamada team, the old man is going to be on the show.

66
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I want you to guess the song.

67
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
There is a song playing on the screen.

68
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I want you to guess the lyrics.

69
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Hamada, can you put on your headphones?

70
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
You have one minute.

71
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:31,000
It's easy.

72
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Hamada, can you answer the question?

73
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
It's a dance song.

74
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
That's too bad.

75
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
That's too bad.

76
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:48,000
The answer is Paradise Galaxy.

77
00:03:48,000 --> 00:04:07,000
VTR, start!

78
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I have no idea.

79
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
It's a dance song.

80
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
It's a dance song.

81
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
It's a dance song.

82
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
It's a dance song.

83
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
It's a dance song.

84
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I have no idea.

85
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
It's a foreign person.

86
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
The old lady gave me a hint.

87
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Foreign person?

88
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Foreign person?

89
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
It's a super 4-piece.

90
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
We have a new set for today.

91
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Look at this.

92
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
We did a good job.

93
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
We did a good job.

94
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
It's exactly what Hibino wrote.

95
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
If you look at the new set,

96
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
it would be better if there was more reaction.

97
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
But you guys are more like animals.

98
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
We are like wild boars.

99
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Even if you say to a dog,

100
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
this reaction is new,

101
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
it would be like that.

102
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
You guys are crazy.

103
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Do something more.

104
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
You are more like wild boars.

105
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
You are more like wild boars.

106
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
We have a new set for today.

107
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Thank you.

108
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
It's a lot of money.

109
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
It's our show.

110
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Why don't we have money for our show?

111
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
We have a lot of money for 30 minutes.

112
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Why?

113
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
We have sponsors.

114
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
We have sponsors.

115
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
We have sponsors.

116
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
What is the sponsor?

117
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Pizza.

118
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Pizza?

119
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Pizza?

120
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Pizza?

121
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Pizza?

122
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
After you become a pizza,

123
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
you can't bring pizza to a restaurant.

124
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
You are crazy.

125
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Pizza?

126
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Bring it in 30 minutes.

127
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
In the middle of the night.

128
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
What else do we have?

129
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
FANKEIRO cosmetics.

130
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
FANKEIRO cosmetics.

131
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
No.

132
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
FANKEIRO cosmetics.

133
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
FANKEIRO cosmetics is the first thing I brought.

134
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
What did you bring?

135
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I don't know.

136
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
It's like a set.

137
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
It's like a face wash.

138
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I brought it.

139
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
What is that?

140
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,000
It's a FANKEIRO cosmetics that tells me to wash my face and come back.

141
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
If you wash your face and come back,

142
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
bring more.

143
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
The sponsor has changed.

144
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Mobile gasoline.

145
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
We bring it.

146
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Gasoline?

147
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
No.

148
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
While you are doing it,

149
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
if you say,

150
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I didn't put gasoline today.

151
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
If you go out and turn on the gas,

152
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
and it's full,

153
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
it feels good.

154
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Don't do that.

155
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Bring more.

156
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
And GEOS.

157
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
It's an English language school.

158
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
English language?

159
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Come and teach me English.

160
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I don't want to teach you.

161
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Don't say that.

162
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
What?

163
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Oh, I see.

164
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
It's been changed since April.

165
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Yes.

166
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
It's a big deal.

167
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Well,

168
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I have to do my best.

169
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Well,

170
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
recently,

171
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
everyone doesn't say much.

172
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
What is it?

173
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
The weather in the Kanto region.

174
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
What?

175
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
It's really cold today, isn't it?

176
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
It's not really cold today.

177
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Is it that cold?

178
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
It's cold.

179
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
It's cold.

180
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
It's cold.

181
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Oh,

182
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
this year,

183
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Uesugi was walking until he answered.

184
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
But it's really cold, isn't it?

185
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,000
That's why the news doesn't go around.

186
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
What are you talking about?

187
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Well,

188
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I have plenty of time,

189
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
so I'll talk slowly.

190
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
No,

191
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I'm talking slowly.

192
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I'm not in a hurry.

193
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
The news doesn't go around.

194
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
What are you talking about?

195
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
You guys!

196
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
If you think all the news is true,

197
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
it's a big mistake.

198
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I'll tell you this.

199
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
You believe it, don't you?

200
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
The news is all true.

201
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,000
It's all made up.

202
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
For example,

203
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I had a hijack.

204
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
No Japanese passengers were on board.

205
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
It has nothing to do with that!

206
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
What?

207
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
It has nothing to do with that!

208
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Whether Japanese people are on board or not.

209
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Why does it have nothing to do with that?

210
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Hijacking is not a big deal,

211
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
so do it more seriously.

212
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
But,

213
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
there's no one to worry about.

214
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
That's a different way of saying it.

215
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
What?

216
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I had a hijack.

217
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
But,

218
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
there's no Japanese people on board.

219
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
That's a different way of saying it.

220
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
That's a different way of saying it.

221
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
That's fine.

222
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
What are you laughing at?

223
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I'm not laughing.

224
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I'm not laughing,

225
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
but why are you so relieved?

226
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I'm relieved.

227
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Because there's no Japanese people on board.

228
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
What?

229
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
What if a foreigner gets on board and gets hurt?

230
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I don't know.

231
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
If it's a foreigner,

232
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
it must be connected to somewhere.

233
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
There's no such thing.

234
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
There's no such thing.

235
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I don't even know that.

236
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Mr. Chadda from Yugoslavia.

237
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
What?

238
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
No, no.

239
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
It's just an example.

240
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
For example,

241
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
when you were about to get on the elevator,

242
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
right?

243
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
When you were about to close the door,

244
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
there was a person who opened the door for you.

245
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
That person is from Yugoslavia.

246
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I've never been in that situation before.

247
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
The person who opened the door.

248
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
The person who opened the door is a Japanese person.

249
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
A Japanese person, Mr. Suzuki, opened the door for you.

250
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Actually,

251
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Mr. Austin from Yugoslavia

252
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
is a friend of Mr. Suzuki.

253
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
The person who saved Mr. Austin's life

254
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
is Mr. Chadda.

255
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
There's no such thing.

256
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,000
That's why you and Mr. Chadda were connected somewhere.

257
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
The reason is that if Mr. Chadda didn't save Mr. Austin,

258
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:05,000
the elevator of Mr. Austin's friend wouldn't have opened.

259
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Do you understand?

260
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
If you think like that,

261
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
you don't care about foreigners.

262
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
There's no such thing.

263
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
That's what I think as a Filipino.

264
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I'm so cool.

265
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
My partner is Filipino.

266
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I'm so cool.

267
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
There are many lies in the weekly magazine.

268
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
What are you doing?

269
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Shut up.

270
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:34,000
There's a CM model.

271
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
She's very popular now.

272
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
When she appeared in the CM,

273
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I asked her who she was.

274
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
She said it was a lie.

275
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
It was a lie.

276
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
When she appeared in the CM,

277
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I asked her who she was.

278
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,000
She said it was a lie.

279
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Today, you and the audience

280
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
are against me.

281
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
What are you talking about?

282
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
That's enough.

283
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
What's enough?

284
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
If you behave like that,

285
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I have an idea.

286
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
What is it?

287
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
What are you going to do?

288
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
What am I going to do?

289
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
You're scared if you make me angry.

290
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
What are you going to do?

291
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
If you make me angry,

292
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I'll really be angry.

293
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
If I bend my back a little,

294
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I'll be angry.

295
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I'm angry.

296
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
If I bend my back a little,

297
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
the show will be messed up.

298
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
If I bend my back a little,

299
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
it will be messed up.

300
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
That's amazing.

301
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
If I bend my back a little,

302
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
it will be messed up.

303
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
What?

304
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
If I bend my back a little,

305
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
the show will be messed up.

306
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I don't care.

307
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I'll do it.

308
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I'm really scared.

309
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Shut up.

310
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
If I bend my back a little,

311
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
the show will be messed up.

312
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Please.

313
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
You're...

314
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Well, I won't bend my back today.

315
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Is this a new Yoshimoto drama?

316
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I'll bend my back next week.

317
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Next week is fine.

318
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Why next week?

319
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
When you talk to people,

320
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
it's hard for me to talk with my arms crossed.

321
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
When I'm scared,

322
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I say something like this.

323
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I don't know if I've said this before.

324
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
People are talking.

325
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I'm listening to them.

326
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Why don't you listen to me like this?

327
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
It's fine.

328
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I'm talking and I can hear you.

329
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
If you can hear me,

330
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
you don't have to do anything.

331
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
If you can hear me,

332
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
you don't have to do anything.

333
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I'm listening to you.

334
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Talk to me.

335
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Talk to me.

336
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Talk to me.

337
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
What are you going to do?

338
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Are you going home tomorrow?

339
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
What?

340
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Are you going home tomorrow?

341
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Are you going home tomorrow?

342
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
That's what I'm saying.

343
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
No.

344
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
That's not it.

345
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I'm not angry.

346
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
You don't have to do anything.

347
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Just answer me.

348
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
That's right.

349
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
If I say something like this,

350
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
people will answer me.

351
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
What should I do?

352
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
If you're angry,

353
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I'm angry.

354
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
If you say something like this,

355
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I'll go home tomorrow.

356
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I'm not angry either.

357
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Really?

358
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Really.

359
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I'm not angry at all.

360
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I'm not angry.

361
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
You'll go home tomorrow.

362
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
You're going home tomorrow.

363
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
You have to keep working.

364
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
That's right.

365
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
It's you.

366
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
You're the one being angry.

367
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
That's annoying.

368
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
What?

369
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Not being angry at the office.

370
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I don't want to go home,

371
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I'm fine with whatever I'm doing.

372
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
You,

373
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
What the hell is this?

374
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
What the hell is this?

375
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
What the hell is this?

376
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
So...

377
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
What do you call it?

378
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
What kind of practice?

379
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Golf.

380
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
That's your hobby.

381
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
And this area is your workplace.

382
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
You bring your hobby to your workplace.

383
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
That's what I like about you.

384
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
No, no.

385
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I'm not being serious.

386
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I'm talking to you.

387
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
You...

388
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Stop it!

389
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Hello.

390
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Hello.

391
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Please introduce yourself.

392
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
My name is Kiriko Kobayashi.

393
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Kiriko?

394
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Kiriko.

395
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
My real name.

396
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I wanted to be on this show as a talent.

397
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
When I was dying.

398
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
In April.

399
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I was told that I was going to do a lot of work.

400
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
As a first attempt.

401
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I thought I could be an assistant.

402
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
That's why I came here.

403
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I see.

404
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
For example, you want to be in a drama.

405
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Yes, I want to be in a drama.

406
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
You want to be a comedian?

407
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I want to be a comedian.

408
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
But it's harder than it looks.

409
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
You're facing the camera and doing this.

410
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
It takes six years to do this.

411
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
It takes eight years.

412
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
This is my first job.

413
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
This is the pose of a cartoonist.

414
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
It takes eight years.

415
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
When we take pictures, we usually do this.

416
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
This is the pose of a cartoonist.

417
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
It takes eight years.

418
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
This is hard.

419
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Thank you very much.

420
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
You want to do something with 1,000 people.

421
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Yes.

422
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
You want to clean the toilet in Yamase-Sennai station.

423
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
If we all do it together, it will be clean.

424
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Why do you do that?

425
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Here we go.

426
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Seriously, why do you do that?

427
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
On a show.

428
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
You.

429
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
What?

430
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,000
You're a sheep.

431
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
You're a fool.

432
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
You haven't cleaned the toilet, have you?

433
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I have.

434
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I cleaned it with my hands.

435
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
You were able to do that.

436
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
That's right.

437
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,000
When I was in high school, I was cleaning the toilet with my hands.

438
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Only in the first year.

439
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
That's a dirty story.

440
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
You have poop on your toilet.

441
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
What are you going to do with that?

442
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
With my nails.

443
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Seriously?

444
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
You're a monster.

445
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
You're a fool.

446
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I'm always having fun.

447
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I don't know how to use the toilet.

448
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
By the way, Machan said that he is good at fighting.

449
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
How many people can you defeat if you are a primary school student?

450
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
If you are a primary school student, it's unlimited.

451
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I don't know if there will be such a person.

452
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I've been fighting a lot lately.

453
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I've been fighting a lot lately.

454
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I'm going to tell you how to fight.

455
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Hurry up and tell me.

456
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
There is a leader in every group.

457
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
That's right.

458
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Finding that leader is the best way to fight.

459
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
That's right.

460
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Even if there are 200 or 300 elementary school students, there is one person who has a bad personality.

461
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
That's the leader.

462
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Right?

463
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Right?

464
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
That's why the leader is like this.

465
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
See?

466
00:17:52,000 --> 00:18:00,000
That means what I'm talking about right now is useless.

467
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,000
There is a leader in every group.

468
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Let me explain the situation so far.

469
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:16,000
There is a leader in every group.

470
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
That's right.

471
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
That's how you find it.

472
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
There is a leader in every group.

473
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:28,000
There is a leader in every group.

474
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
That's wrong.

475
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
That's not the leader.

476
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Even though everyone is the leader, it's the leader in everyone's bath.

477
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
That's not the leader.

478
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
That's not the leader.

479
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
You should do as much as you can.

480
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
It's better to do as much as you can.

481
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Everyone's here.

482
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Everyone's here.

483
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
That's the leader.

484
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
That's the leader.

485
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
That's the leader.

486
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Koko!

487
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I'm here!

488
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
The leader falls down.

489
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
What a fool.

490
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Why don't you appear in movies and dramas like Hama-chan?

491
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I'm a fan of you.

492
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
What?

493
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I'm a fan of you.

494
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
You're a fan?

495
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:25,000
When I asked my friend what he thought of me, he said, look at his face. He has a stupid face.

496
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
And he's a super ultra-handsome and homo-like person.

497
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,000
He can't remember lines and his acting is like Horichemi.

498
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I was a super ultra-special mammoth shock.

499
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Are you doing a radio shock?

500
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Hama-chan, do you know how good Mach-chan's acting is? If you know, please tell me.

501
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:52,000
P.S. Hama-chan's acting is better than the famous short story.

502
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
This is...

503
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I hate it.

504
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
And I'm a big fan of you.

505
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Your acting is totally different from the acting in the story.

506
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Totally different.

507
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
That's true.

508
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Once I become an actor, I'll be scared even if I play Moriishi.

509
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Why are you saying that all of a sudden?

510
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Say something more serious.

511
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I don't want to make Japanese actors and actresses my enemies.

512
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:40,000
But everyone's acting is a little stinky.

513
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Who's stinky?

514
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Everyone.

515
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
I don't want to make you look sad.

516
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
You can't make a sad face when you're really sad.

517
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
What kind of face do I make when I'm really sad?

518
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:58,000
When you're really sad, you can't make a face like this.

519
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,000
You can't make a face like this.

520
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Say it quickly.

521
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
You can't make a face like this.

522
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Say it quickly.

523
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Say it quickly.

524
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
You can't say anything because you don't say what you want to say.

525
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
I can't say anything.

526
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
You can't say it quickly.

527
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
1,000,000 yen.

528
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
That's too much.

529
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:26,000
You can't make a face like this.

530
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
That's not true.

531
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
What kind of face do I make when I'm sad?

532
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
There are different ways to make a sad face.

533
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
For example, when my parents died.

534
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Oh, your parents died. How did they die?

535
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
From the outside, the cell changes into one.

536
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I was sick and just slept all the time.

537
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I was doing my job.

538
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Then I got the news that it was dangerous.

539
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I ran back to the hospital in a hurry.

540
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I opened the door, but I was already dead.

541
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
That's the setting.

542
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Then there's a door, right?

543
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
There are five of us.

544
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
That's when the camera...

545
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
The sad feeling at that time.

546
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Unfortunately, there are five of us.

547
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Hello.

548
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
This is the ending.

549
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
It looks like you were talking today.

550
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
I talked for a long time, so I ended up like this.

551
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
The set has changed.

552
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
This is the set I've been wearing so far.

553
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
This neon can.

554
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
I'll give it to you as a gift.

555
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
For those of you who watch TV.

556
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
If you want it, write it down.

557
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
I'll give you all the details.

558
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
But it's noisy.

559
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
I'll give it to those who can come to get it.

560
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
This neon can.

561
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
For those who can come to get it.

562
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
I'll give it to you as a gift.

563
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
I'll give you a lottery from there.

564
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,000
At worst, if you take this off, you'll get a grilled meat party.

565
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Barbecue.

566
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
This is iron plate.

567
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
This can't be iron plate.

568
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
It's a net.

569
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Please come over here.

570
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
And the baby and the assistant.

571
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
The baby and the assistant are also here.

572
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
And the assistant.

573
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Please come over here.

574
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
That's all.

575
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I don't like crying.

576
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
I don't like crying.

577
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Thank you for your viewing.
