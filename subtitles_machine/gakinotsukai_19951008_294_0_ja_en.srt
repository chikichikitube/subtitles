1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
It's time for the staff free talk show!

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
They're not taking it off

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
They don't like it

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I don't understand how professional they are

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
If they're just going to do free talk, they're going to ask for laughter

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Since it's just the two of you, let's choose from here

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Let's start with the first group

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Since it's just the two of you

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Since it's just the two of you

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
You have to come here

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Yanaoka

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
About us and our family

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
No

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
And don't touch the audience

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
No no no

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
So you can see us from time to time

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
No

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Let's start with the opening

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
This program is brought to you by the following sponsors

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Let's go

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
First group, Yanaoka, Otomo

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Ladies and gentlemen

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Next month, you're getting married

24
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Congratulations

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I heard you got a young lady

26
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
No, it's not like that

27
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I'm going to get married and come back

28
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
So that's what you're going to do

29
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
You're not saying anything interesting

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Right?

31
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
You're all dressed up

32
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
It's warm

33
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Thank you everyone

34
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Thank you so much

35
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
What is that?

36
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
What is that?

37
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
You didn't bring anything

38
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
What is this?

39
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Seiza

40
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Seiza

41
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
You guys

42
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Today's guest is warm

43
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
It's really warm

44
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Let's go

45
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Who's next?

46
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
This is no good

47
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
This

48
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
And

49
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
What is this?

50
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
No matter what it is, I have a lot of love for this program

51
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Ladies and gentlemen

52
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Hello

53
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
What is this?

54
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I don't know much about this person

55
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Even if I'm asked to be in the second team

56
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Recently I've been walking around the city

57
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
And people say I look like him

58
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
But recently my concept is Kimutaku

59
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Don't come back

60
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,000
What is this?

61
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
This is my strongest comedy

62
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Who do you think looks the coolest?

63
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I don't know

64
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Don't say that

65
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
If you say that, then say it

66
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Nozomu-san, shouldn't you have a postcard?

67
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Without talking

68
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I don't think so

69
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
You don't think so?

70
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I still have to go to the bathroom

71
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Why did you kick me?

72
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I was looking at you and you kicked me

73
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I was turning around

74
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I wasn't turning around

75
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Why?

76
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I was just flapping

77
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I'm sorry

78
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I'm sorry

79
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
This is difficult

80
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
This is hard

81
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I don't do this

82
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I don't do this

83
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I don't do this

84
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I think he can do it

85
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I think he can do it

86
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
So he's a good partner

87
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I think he can do it

88
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I think he can do it

89
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I can do both otaku and house

90
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I can do both

91
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I haven't seen them talking

92
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Ladies and gentlemen

93
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
There's not much to it

94
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
It's really our first time meeting

95
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I think Okamoto-kun is a celebrity

96
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
That's right

97
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
That's right

98
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Saying that's right is rude

99
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
But I think it's true

100
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I've lost my regular job since fall

101
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Is that so?

102
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Even when I walk around the streets

103
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I've become someone who doesn't have a job

104
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I'm getting a pretty depressed reaction

105
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
It's rude

106
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
It's not like that

107
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
That's right

108
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I sometimes see it on the screen

109
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Sometimes

110
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
When this is on the screen

111
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I might lose my only regular job

112
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
What do you do then?

113
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I'm an idiot

114
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
That was the end

115
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I don't think about it seriously

116
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Thank you very much

117
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Thank you

118
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
It was good to have you two

119
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
You had a chance to run away

120
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Why did you talk about it?

121
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
We didn't talk about it seriously

122
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Even though you were on the show

123
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I was thinking about the costume

124
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
You should have listened to your partner

125
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
You should have listened to your partner

126
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
What do you call yourself?

127
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Okamoto

128
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
That's rude

129
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Everyone says it's rude

130
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
You want to show it

131
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
That's right

132
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I've prepared it

133
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Let's see it

134
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Hello

135
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
It's 8 o'clock

136
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
It's 8 o'clock

137
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
It's 8 o'clock

138
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,000
It's 8 o'clock

139
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Until now

140
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I'm an amateur

141
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I don't have the energy to talk

142
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I don't have the energy to talk

143
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I don't have the energy to talk

144
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I don't have the energy to talk

145
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Do you want to write a letter?

146
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
This is hard

147
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I don't have the energy to talk

148
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Don't open the door

149
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Hey, stop

150
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Don't make my show dirty

151
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I'll read it

152
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I'm the man who came here to recommend

153
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I'll read the first one

154
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
This is a question for Dea-san

155
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Who is the next popular member of Johnny's?

156
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I don't know

157
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
If you keep your nose hair long

158
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
What will happen?

159
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
If I keep my nose hair long

160
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I'll look bad

161
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Wow

162
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
It's a white towel

163
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Leave the towel

164
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Don't you play sports?

165
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I'm a sports baseball player

166
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
What?

167
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
You threw a white towel

168
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
It's a knockout

169
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Thank you

170
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Oh no

171
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Everyone

172
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
It's not like that

173
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
It's not like that

174
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
My partner is crying

175
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
It's not like that

176
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Why are you crying?

177
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Why are you crying?

178
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Why are you crying?

179
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I have to use the bomb

180
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
What is that?

181
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I have to use the bomb

182
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
It's been a long time

183
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
It's been a long time

184
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
You look happy

185
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I'm in trouble

186
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
You're in trouble?

187
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
He has muscle pain and fever

188
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
He has a cold

189
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
No one asked him to go home

190
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
But I think I can do it

191
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Right?

192
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I'll do it

193
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I'm a genius

194
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Mr. Jigashi

195
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Yesterday we did a 50m race

196
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I won

197
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Wait

198
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I won

199
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
We didn't exercise

200
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
We didn't fall

201
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I fell

202
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
You didn't fall

203
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I was desperate

204
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I was desperate

205
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I won

206
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
You were desperate

207
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Why did you run like that?

208
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Why did you run like that?

209
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Why did you run like that?

210
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Actually

211
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Actually

212
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
If you can't say it, don't say it

213
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I made a mistake

214
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Who is it?

215
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Who is it?

216
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Who is it?

217
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
It's Furuhata Ninjaburo

218
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
It doesn't look like you

219
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I'm tired

220
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I'm listening to the talk

221
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I'm listening to the talk

222
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I'm listening to the talk

223
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
It's not interesting

224
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
But today's guest is sweet

225
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
It's because of the atmosphere

226
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Today was a good guest

227
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I wanted to do it with a worse guest

228
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
It's not funny at all

229
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
It's not funny at all

230
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
But

231
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
What should I say?

232
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
You should say it yourself

233
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
You're good

234
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Please listen

235
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Even now

236
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Even now

237
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
After the title match

238
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Why did Matsumoto-san throw away his boxing gloves?

239
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Why did Matsumoto-san throw away his boxing gloves?

240
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Why did Matsumoto-san throw away his boxing gloves?

241
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Don't take them off!

242
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Don't take them off!

243
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
What is this?

244
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
What is this?

245
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
It's like

246
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
It's like

247
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I'm your partner

248
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
That's right

249
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
When I was boxing

250
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
What did you do?

251
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I was Megaton Matsumoto

252
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
You were Megaton Matsumoto?

253
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
You were either a champion or a first place

254
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
You were the bottom

255
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
You were the champion

256
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
What was your name?

257
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Megaton Matsumoto

258
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
You were the champion?

259
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
The champion was great

260
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Who was it?

261
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
No, what about you?

262
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Megaton

263
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Coincidentally, we have the same name

264
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
The name is the same

265
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
You're so mean!

266
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Well, that's true

267
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
But the champion was a while ago

268
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Megaton came back

269
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
No, it was your debut

270
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
What's with that face?

271
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Are you an otaku?

272
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Change your name

273
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
You can't change your name

274
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
You can't change your name

275
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
You can't change your name

276
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Megaton Matsumoto

277
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
It's the strongest name

278
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Megaton Matsumoto vs Megaton Matsumoto

279
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Well, we have the same name

280
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Which one wins?

281
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
In the end, Megaton is the older brother

282
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Megaton is the younger brother

283
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
That's mean

284
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Well, that's true

285
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Which one is the older brother?

286
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I'm the older brother

287
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Even though we're not siblings

288
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
How many rounds did you have?

289
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Until the end

290
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
There was an extension

291
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
In the end

292
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Basically, it was a fight

293
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
It's a boxing match

294
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Why did you wear gloves

295
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
in the end?

296
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
He licked my lips

297
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Who?

298
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Megaton Matsumoto

299
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Who are you?

300
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Megaton Matsumoto

301
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
My older brother

302
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Your younger brother

303
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
We had a good fight

304
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
It was an exclusive

305
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
It was an exclusive boxing match

306
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
It was very spicy

307
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
It was very spicy

308
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
He ran into the corner

309
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,000
It was very spicy

310
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
It was very spicy

311
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Which one won?

312
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I won

313
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
You won?

314
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
You're the champion

315
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
You quit?

316
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I quit

317
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Why did you quit?

318
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
The reason

319
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Why did you quit?

320
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
It ended

321
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Everyone was like

322
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Megaton! Megaton!

323
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Megaton!

324
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
It sounds heavy

325
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Thank you, everyone

326
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Thank you, everyone

327
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I said it about 8 times

328
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
You said it too many times

329
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
It doesn't matter how long

330
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I said it

331
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I went home

332
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I was lonely

333
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
It was a beautiful stage

334
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
When I opened the door

335
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
It was full of gloves

336
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I was so angry

337
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I wanted to sleep

338
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I don't need it anymore

339
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
It was written in the magazine

340
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I thought the kogyal boom had calmed down

341
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I thought the kogyal boom had calmed down

342
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,000
It was the young lady's

343
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Komadam boom

344
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
The trend leader

345
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
What kind of boom

346
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Will come next?

347
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Do you know what the Komadam boom is?

348
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I don't

349
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
You know the kogyal

350
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Komadam boom

351
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Can you put out your antenna?

352
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Your antenna

353
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
And catch it

354
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I've been hitting it

355
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
You hit the lack of glasses

356
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I don't lack glasses

357
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Everyone is wearing glasses

358
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
You said you lack water and rice

359
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
You said you lack glasses

360
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I didn't

361
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
You did

362
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Did you go to the Komadam boom?

363
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I did

364
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
You didn't

365
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
You should have

366
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I didn't

367
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I think I said it

368
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
You will edit it

369
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
What's wrong with you?

370
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
It's an edit

371
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
It's an edit

372
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Don't reveal what you don't need

373
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I'm really angry

374
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I'm really angry

375
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I'm really angry

376
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I'm cutting it

377
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I'm cutting it

378
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I'm not cutting it

379
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
What kind of boom

380
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
The next one is the Kominato boom

381
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
There's a little Kominato

382
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
You mean Minato-machi?

383
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
What's so exciting about the Kominato boom?

384
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
The Kominato

385
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
That's strange

386
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
What's so exciting about the Kominato

387
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
It's very exciting

388
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
What's so exciting about it?

389
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
This is amazing

390
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Let me hear it

391
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Okay

392
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Can I say it again?

393
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Why is the Kominato boom so exciting?

394
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Okay

395
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Why?

396
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
You should say it

397
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
You should say it

398
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
What's so exciting about it?

399
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I'm listening

400
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Go

401
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
You should say it

402
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
You should say it twice

403
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
It's dirty

404
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
You should say it yourself

405
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
The Kominato is exciting, right?

406
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
It's exciting, okay

407
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
What's so exciting about it?

408
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
That's not it

409
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
That's not it

410
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
You should say it three times

411
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
You should say it three times

412
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
What's so exciting about it?

413
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
What's so exciting about it?

414
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
You said earlier that you're a high school girl

415
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
You said earlier that you're a high school girl

416
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
The Kominato is making

417
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,000
The Kominato is making a scene

418
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
They're selling their underwear

419
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
It's very exciting, right?

420
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
It's exciting, but it's very exciting

421
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
You should say it

422
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
You should say it

423
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
It's actually very exciting

424
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
The words of the proposal that were in the magazine

425
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
The words of the proposal that were in the magazine

426
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Top 5

427
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
1. Let's get married

428
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
2. Let's get married and 3. Let's work hard together

429
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
4. Give birth to my child

430
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
5. I want to eat your food

431
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Now, if Matsumoto-san is the age to fall in love

432
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
What kind of words would you use to propose?

433
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
The Japanese port is...

434
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
The Japanese port is...

435
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
The Japanese port is... the kitchen

436
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
What?

437
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
The Japanese port is the kitchen

438
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Hey, everyone listen to me

439
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
The Japanese port is the kitchen

440
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
The Japanese port is the kitchen

441
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Anyone understand?

442
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
If you say that

443
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
That's your proposal

444
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
You don't know

445
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
What is that?

446
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I was wondering what you were saying

447
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I was wondering what you were saying

448
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
And then you said yes

449
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
And then you said yes and your wife couldn't read it

450
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I don't understand what you're implying

451
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
I don't understand what you're implying

452
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
If there's something like that

453
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
What was I saying?

454
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I was saying that I'd use my love to relieve myself

455
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
So that's what I said, right?

456
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Yes, that's what you said.

457
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
So it's not me, it's you, Inari-san!

458
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
But it's already over, right?

459
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
You should've told me at least one proposal.

460
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
You often say that you want to drink the morning coffee, right?

461
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
That's a little...

462
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
There's a guy who says, please wash my underwear.

463
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
There's a guy who says, please wash my underwear.

464
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
What is this?

465
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
No, no, no.

466
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
This is bad.

467
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Ah, Te-chan!

468
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
What is this?

469
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
It doesn't make any sense at all.

470
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
I'll wash your underwear.

471
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
This won't be a proposal.

472
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I'll tell you one proposal.

473
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Yes.

474
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Tell him, Te-chan.

475
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
No, really, Tamo-san.

476
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
How many proposals do you have? There are about six.

477
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
The second one.

478
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
The second one.

479
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
If we do this, maybe...

480
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Japan...

481
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,000
From the end of this year to the beginning of next year...

482
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Maybe we'll enter the age of marriage.

483
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
The thing is...

484
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
The age of marriage?

485
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
The thing is...

486
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
A man and a woman who have never met before...

487
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
By saying these words that I'm about to tell you...

488
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
There's a possibility that they'll get married.

489
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
A lot of couples will get married.

490
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
A lot of couples will get married.

491
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Right?

492
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
That's the opposite.

493
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
You guys are laughing too much.

494
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
That's the opposite.

495
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
You're misunderstanding.

496
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
This movement...

497
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
A man and a woman...

498
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
What is this?

499
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Well, it's fine.

500
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Today is that kind of day.

501
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Do whatever you want.

502
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
If you hear those words...

503
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Yes, yes, yes.

504
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
It'll be a big deal.

505
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
The second one is fine.

506
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Tell him.

507
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Is that okay?

508
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Yes.

509
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
What?

510
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I want you to say it.

511
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Japanese red.

512
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Is that part of the sentence?

513
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Is that part of the sentence?

514
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Yes, yes.

515
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
I'm sorry.

516
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
It's already over.

517
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
What?

518
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
No, no, no.

519
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:22,000
You're only saying Japanese red.

520
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
I thought it might be like that.

521
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
But it's not like that.

522
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
I don't know why.

523
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
If you...

524
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
If you love me...

525
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Is that okay?

526
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Yes.

527
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
If you call me to a restaurant.

528
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
What is it today?

529
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
I'll be like, okay.

530
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
What?

531
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
I'll put on a tie or something.

532
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
I'll call you to a restaurant or something.

533
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
I won't tell you that.

534
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Say it quickly.

535
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Is that okay?

536
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Say the word propose.

537
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:14,000
I'll call you.
