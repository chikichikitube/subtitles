00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
On September 24, in Sagara-cho, Shizuoka Prefecture.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
In this town, which usually looks calm and calm,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
on this day, a silent sense of tension began to flow.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Now, the legendary long day is slowly beginning to open its curtain.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Downtown Special 24-hour Talk.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
The staff of a total of 500 people are gradually preparing.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
At 3 o'clock in the afternoon, Hamada arrives.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
50 minutes late, Matsumoto arrives.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I can't do it, but I'll turn the camera.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
As the curfew approaches and the weather worsens,

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
1,000 people are starting to come in.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
The rain that never stops,

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
and the excitement of the audience waiting for downtown is increasing.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
It's starting.

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
It's starting.

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Finally, the 24-hour hot battle begins.

17
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
The rain that never stops,

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
and the excitement of the audience waiting for downtown is increasing.

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
It's starting.

20
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
The rain that never stops,

21
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
and the excitement of the audience waiting for downtown is increasing.

22
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,880
He's clearly lost.

23
00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:00,380
His smile got choked up.

24
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:07,120
Just do it Ð»

25
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,320
did we lose again?

26
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:11,580
We lost?!

27
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:15,960
It's about time we spent some time with our fans.

28
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:19,960
It's so hot in here!

29
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,620
Oh dear.

30
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:23,620
It's finally here

31
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:28,620
There's a lot of people

32
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:29,620
Yes, hello

33
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:33,620
In this rain

34
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:40,620
In this rain

35
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:41,620
Yes

36
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:43,620
It's weird to do this

37
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:44,620
It's weird

38
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:45,620
We can't do this

39
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:46,620
We can't

40
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,620
You guys can't come either

41
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:51,620
We can't do this because you guys are coming

42
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:54,620
Because I don't have any weight today

43
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:55,620
In the middle

44
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:58,620
I don't have any weight today

45
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:02,620
So I thought I'd go drink some tea

46
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:04,620
So I came all the way to Shizuoka

47
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:07,620
What are you doing?

48
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:11,620
There's a lot of things

49
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:13,620
What is this? Is this a broadcast code?

50
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:14,620
No, no

51
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:16,620
If it's that, it's too late

52
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:17,620
It's too late

53
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:19,620
You said you had a lot of ideas

54
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:20,620
Yes

55
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:21,620
You said 24 hours

56
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:22,620
Yes

57
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:23,620
You said 12 hours

58
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:24,620
What?

59
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:25,620
No, no, no

60
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:26,620
That's not it

61
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:28,620
You said 6 hours

62
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:30,620
I said it

63
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:32,620
You only said 2 hours

64
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:33,620
That's right

65
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:34,620
It's only 2 hours

66
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:36,620
So even if we talk for 24 hours

67
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:38,620
22 hours is useless

68
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:41,620
Is this allowed?

69
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:44,620
And it's not like anyone is coming

70
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:45,620
There's no one

71
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:46,620
You can go out and talk

72
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:48,620
24 hours, please

73
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:49,620
No, no, no

74
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:51,620
If I say this now

75
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:53,620
Some of the people we talked to are laughing

76
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:56,620
But no one is laughing

77
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:58,620
If that's the case, I don't need it

78
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:03,620
There's also a meal time

79
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:06,620
There's a lot of things

80
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:08,620
But you have to do it for 24 hours

81
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:11,620
It's called downtown help

82
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:13,620
Choose that

83
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:14,620
Yes

84
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:16,620
You have to help

85
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:18,620
You have to spend a little bit of time

86
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:20,620
There's a lot of things like that

87
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:22,620
Let's go to the post office

88
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:23,620
Not yet

89
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:28,620
If you do that, I won't be able to hold it

90
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:32,620
It's a long way to go

91
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:39,620
This is real

92
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:40,620
I can feel it

93
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:43,620
For the time being, it's good to talk

94
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:44,620
That's right

95
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:45,620
That's right

96
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:47,620
Don't go around

97
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,620
Let's stay here

98
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:51,620
There's a lot of things

99
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:52,620
No, no, no

100
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,620
There's a lot of things

101
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:55,620
No, no, no

102
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:56,620
Let's go together

103
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:58,620
Nice to meet you

104
00:04:58,620 --> 00:04:59,620
Nice to meet you

105
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:05,620
We met

106
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:07,620
Wait

107
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:10,620
No one noticed

108
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,620
You can't talk about that

109
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:14,620
You can't talk about that

110
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:16,620
Are you tired already?

111
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:18,620
You can't talk about that

112
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:20,620
Please bring out the post

113
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:35,620
Let's introduce

114
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:37,620
The postman, Nakamori Akira

115
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:43,620
When I first came out, there wasn't much reaction

116
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:44,620
What are you doing?

117
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:48,620
I'm Nakamori Akira

118
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:52,620
It took a while for me to notice

119
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:54,620
I told you not to come

120
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,620
I'm from the post office

121
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:58,620
What are you talking about?

122
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:02,620
To explain the situation

123
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:05,620
I always do a free talk show

124
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:07,620
But today is 24 hours

125
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:09,620
So the Filipinos who live in Japan

126
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:13,620
I'm happy to be back

127
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:14,620
It's an event

128
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:16,620
Japanese budget

129
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:19,620
Do you want to introduce the post?

130
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:21,620
This is Akina-chan's question

131
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:22,620
This is Akina-chan's question?

132
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:23,620
Yes, let's do that

133
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:26,620
Where did the phrase that you can't go anywhere

134
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:28,620
Come from?

135
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:30,620
I see

136
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:32,620
Do you know?

137
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:34,620
Of course I know

138
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:36,620
He knows everything

139
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:38,620
I know everything

140
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:40,620
You're thinking right?

141
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:42,620
You're thinking right?

142
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:44,620
I'm not thinking

143
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:46,620
I'm just remembering

144
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:48,620
I remembered

145
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:50,620
I remembered

146
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:52,620
I remembered

147
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,620
I remembered

148
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:56,620
I remembered

149
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:58,620
I remembered

150
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,620
Look

151
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,620
Animals

152
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:04,620
What do you like about animals?

153
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:06,620
What do you like about Akina?

154
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:08,620
Horse

155
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:10,620
Horse

156
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:12,620
That's it

157
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:14,620
What?

158
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:16,620
Horse has a special skill

159
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:18,620
For example

160
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:20,620
This is a horse running on a person

161
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:22,620
What other animals do you have?

162
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:24,620
Dog, cat

163
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:26,620
Dog, cat

164
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:30,620
Cat has a role of smiling and telling the next day's weather

165
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:32,620
Dog?

166
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:34,620
Dog

167
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,620
Dog can bark at people and tell their owner

168
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:38,620
Dog can bark at people and tell their owner

169
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:40,620
Dog can...

170
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:42,620
All animals have roles

171
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:44,620
All animals have roles

172
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:46,620
That's fine

173
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:48,620
But Bulldogs doesn't have any role

174
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:50,620
But Bulldogs doesn't have any role

175
00:07:50,620 --> 00:08:01,620
I've got it. I've got it. I've got it!

176
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:06,620
That Bulldog is really...

177
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:10,620
That Bulldog is really...

178
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:13,620
That Bulldog is really...

179
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:18,620
I sang that before I came out.

180
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:19,620
What is that?

181
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:22,620
What kind of person do you like as a man?

182
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:25,620
I like someone who is fun.

183
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:27,620
Someone who is fun?

184
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:32,620
If you're asked which one is which, which one is which?

185
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:35,620
Which one am I?

186
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:38,620
Which one do you think is more manly?

187
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:43,620
I'm not kidding. If you just say the face, it's really...

188
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:46,620
Really.

189
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:49,620
What do you think?

190
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:52,620
Wait. Don't look too far.

191
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:59,620
You're doing a drama with a pretty good character, right?

192
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:05,620
If you look at that, I really like that kind of impression.

193
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:10,620
But since you didn't come out, you're a fool like this.

194
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:21,620
I'm sorry. I'm not a fool. I'm just doing this kind of comedy.

195
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:27,620
I got scared.

196
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:29,620
Did you write something? Do you want something to drink?

197
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:31,620
Yes.

198
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:33,620
There's a fridge over there.

199
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:35,620
Of course.

200
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:37,620
Let's drink sake.

201
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,620
You can't do that.

202
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:47,620
If I had to drink this much, it would be easier for me to drink it as it is.

203
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:50,620
Please sit down.

204
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:53,620
I've prepared a lot of help stories.

205
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:56,620
Let's take a look.

206
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:58,620
Do you want to see the help story?

207
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:05,620
I've prepared a story that will help us.

208
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:07,620
This is the first time.

209
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:10,620
It's a fireworks show.

210
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:33,620
Please enjoy it.

211
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:50,620
It's amazing.

212
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:18,620
It's amazing.

213
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:29,620
It's amazing.

214
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:36,620
I can't stand it if I get hit in the house.

215
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:38,620
I can't stand it if I get hit in the house.

216
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:42,620
This program is brought to you by Tiger Magic.

217
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,620
Moelia Asahi Beer.

218
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:51,620
Sponsored by Lion Nipro.

219
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:54,620
I don't want anything like oolong tea.

220
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:56,620
Go get it yourself.

221
00:11:56,620 --> 00:12:02,620
Go get it yourself.

222
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:08,620
Go get it yourself.

223
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:14,620
Hayaki, don't you think it's time for you to stop?

224
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:29,620
I don't know if it was a mistake to light a fire so early.

225
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:31,620
It's beer.

226
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:33,620
I'm waiting for it.

227
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:35,620
It's tea.

228
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:37,620
It's like oolong tea.

229
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:39,620
It's oolong tea.

230
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:40,620
It's oolong tea.

231
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:45,620
It's oolong tea.

232
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:46,620
I know.

233
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:59,620
It's a non-smell sky.

234
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:03,620
It's a non-smell sky.

235
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:07,620
I'm getting drunk.

236
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:10,620
If you're drunk, I'll sue you.

237
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:14,620
Let me go.

238
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:16,620
I don't have a partner.

239
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:17,620
I do.

240
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:19,620
I can't kill my partner.

241
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:22,620
I can do it if I'm a master.

242
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:23,620
No way.

243
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:24,620
Do it.

244
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:25,620
Shut up.

245
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:28,620
Why are you acting like a junior high school student?

246
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:33,620
He's taking a video letter.

247
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:36,620
Video letter.

248
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,620
Machan, Hama-chan, how are you doing?

249
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:44,620
24 hours talk.

250
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:47,620
You did a good job.

251
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:53,620
Machan, Hama-chan, you're always like a father with a bad son.

252
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:56,620
Don't give up until the end of 24 hours.

253
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:00,620
It's hard to say, but please do your best.

254
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:06,620
Machan, Hama-chan, you've been doing this for 24 hours.

255
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:08,620
I won't do it.

256
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:12,620
Machan, Hama-chan, you're great.

257
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:17,620
Even if it's a week, you're still the same.

258
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:19,620
That's what I like the most.

259
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:26,620
I was really surprised to hear that you two were going to do a 24-hour stage.

260
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:34,620
When I'm tired and sleepy, I'll do it at my own pace.

261
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:41,620
I like the combination of Hamada-san and Machan.

262
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:42,620
Please do your best.

263
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:46,620
Happy New Year, everyone.

264
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:47,620
I'm Kyoshi Ishikawa.

265
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:56,620
I used to think that 24-hour TV was a show about welfare work and love.

266
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:57,620
Is that so?

267
00:14:58,620 --> 00:14:59,620
Are you making money?

268
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:04,620
I'll do my best from now on.

269
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:10,620
Machan, Hama-chan, you're going to do a 24-hour free talk.

270
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:15,620
I wanted to see you for about two hours.

271
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:17,620
Please do your best.

272
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:20,620
Machan, I love you.

273
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:25,620
Machan, Hama-chan, you've been doing this for 24 hours.

274
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:37,620
I was surprised to hear that you two were going to do a 24-hour TV.

275
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:41,620
I've been doing 24-hour TV for 17 years.

276
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:45,620
There's only one thing that can make it last 24 hours.

277
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:47,620
Don't overdo it.

278
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:50,620
Don't overdo it.

279
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:52,620
It's going to kill you.

280
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,620
Don't overdo it.

281
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:56,620
Don't overdo it.

282
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:00,620
Hamada is already crying.

283
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:01,620
I'm not crying.

284
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:04,620
I'm not crying.

285
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:05,620
He's crying.

286
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:06,620
He's crying.

287
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:07,620
I'm not crying.

288
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:11,620
This video letter is a little cowardly.

289
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:12,620
Why?

290
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:14,620
I don't like it.

291
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:16,620
Are you serious?

292
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:19,620
Are you trying to make me cry?

293
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:21,620
Turn it up.

294
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:25,620
Don't cry like that.

295
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:27,620
This is cowardly.

296
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:30,620
I'm not crying.

297
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:33,620
I'm not crying.

298
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:37,620
This video letter is a little cowardly.

299
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:39,620
Don't overdo it.

300
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:42,620
He's the one who cried for 24 hours.

301
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:45,620
I want to go home.

302
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:51,620
I was happy when I was in elementary school.

303
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:53,620
I don't think so.

304
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:55,620
What?

305
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:57,620
Call talent.

306
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:58,620
Call him.

307
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:01,620
Please bring out the board.

308
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:06,620
Mr. Magno.

309
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:07,620
Yes.

310
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:10,620
Please come to our show.

311
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:12,620
Please come to our show.

312
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:15,620
Please come to our show.

313
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:17,620
I have a lot of money left.

314
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:19,620
I don't care.

315
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:22,620
Please come to our show.

316
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:23,620
Hello.

317
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:24,620
Hello.

318
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:25,620
Hello.

319
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:26,620
Marina.

320
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:27,620
I'm the best.

321
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:28,620
I'm the best.

322
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:30,620
I don't know if it's true.

323
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:31,620
Marina?

324
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:32,620
Is that you?

325
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:33,620
That's right.

326
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:35,620
Can I call you Pino?

327
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:38,620
Pino.

328
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:40,620
Where are you now?

329
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:42,620
Tamori.

330
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:44,620
Please change it to Tamori.

331
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:46,620
Really?

332
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:48,620
Tamori.

333
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:49,620
Tamori.

334
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:50,620
What?

335
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:52,620
It's Hamada from Taotao.

336
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:57,620
Can you buy it for me?

337
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:59,620
Hello.

338
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:00,620
Hello.

339
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:01,620
What are you doing?

340
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:04,620
I'm shooting a show right now.

341
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:05,620
What kind of show?

342
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:08,620
It's a special for child users.

343
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:10,620
Is it a special for child users?

344
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:11,620
That's right.

345
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:15,620
Tamori's picture is on the big screen.

346
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:17,620
I'll tell you something.

347
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:18,620
Yes.

348
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:21,620
Are you two making fun of me?

349
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:24,620
It's not like that.

350
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:25,620
Hey.

351
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:27,620
Why are you doing that?

352
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:30,620
Tamori, it's time to introduce your friend.

353
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:33,620
I'll buy it for you.

354
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:35,620
Thank you very much.

355
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:36,620
Hello.

356
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:37,620
Hello.

357
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:38,620
Yes.

358
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:40,620
I thought you were going to eat yakiniku.

359
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,620
What do you want?

360
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:44,620
I want caviar.

361
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:46,620
Caviar?

362
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:48,620
I just want caviar.

363
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:50,620
I got it.

364
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:51,620
I'll be waiting for you.

365
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:52,620
Yes.

366
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:54,620
Please take care of Tamori.

367
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:55,620
Yes.

368
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:56,620
Good luck.

369
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:57,620
Thank you very much.

370
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:04,620
It's been a long time.

371
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:06,620
What?

372
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:08,620
Let's listen to the new music.

373
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:11,620
Oh, my God.

374
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:13,620
It's been raining a lot.

375
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:15,620
Don't get wet.

376
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:21,620
The weather is not good.

377
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:23,620
But it's strange.

378
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:27,620
It didn't rain when I did it.

379
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:30,620
It's hard now.

380
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:34,620
But after a month or two,

381
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:36,620
I had a good memory.

382
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:37,620
Do you remember?

383
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:38,620
I don't remember.

384
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:42,620
It's been raining a lot.

385
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:45,620
I don't like it.

386
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:48,620
Good luck.

387
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:53,620
When you say good luck,

388
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:54,620
don't hit me.

389
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:57,620
I'm not your enemy.

390
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:00,620
I don't like it.

391
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:02,620
Shall we play badminton?

392
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:03,620
Let's do it.

393
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:05,620
It looks fun.

394
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:11,620
Shiritori badminton corner.

395
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:15,620
Lion.

396
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:19,620
Don't call me Shiritori.

397
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:22,620
Don't call me Shiritori.

398
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:25,620
I have a lion.

399
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:28,620
Let's play Kompachi.

400
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:30,620
You have to eat something.

401
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:31,620
Okay.

402
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:33,620
You play first.

403
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:34,620
Mochi.

404
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:36,620
Chimpon.

405
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:41,620
I lost.

406
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:43,620
I can eat.

407
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:50,620
Menrui.

408
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:51,620
Ramen.

409
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:53,620
Yakisoba.

410
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:57,620
You don't say anything.

411
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:00,620
What did I do?

412
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:03,620
I didn't expect you to come back so beautiful.

413
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:04,620
What did I do?

414
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:05,620
I don't know.

415
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:07,620
Don't talk to me.

416
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:13,620
The species of insects.

417
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:14,620
Okay.

418
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:15,620
Cob.

419
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:16,620
Tombo.

420
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:17,620
Wakata.

421
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:18,620
Insect.

422
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:27,620
I know that.

423
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:30,620
I know that.

424
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:32,620
It hurts.

425
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:37,620
Let's do it again.

426
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:41,620
Again.

427
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:42,620
I'm sorry.

428
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:44,620
I'll scream.

429
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:47,620
You are not a normal guest.

430
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:49,620
But I'm happy.

431
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:51,620
I'm so excited at this time.

432
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:53,620
You are the only one.

433
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:55,620
I'm sorry.

434
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:56,620
Actually.

435
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:57,620
I'm hungry.

436
00:21:57,620 --> 00:22:00,620
There is a restaurant near here.

437
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:02,620
It's called Tonkitsu.

438
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:04,620
I'm not lying.

439
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:07,620
It's really delicious.

440
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:08,620
This is good.

441
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:13,620
It's hot.

442
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:16,620
You are a German toast.

443
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:18,620
Don't eat it close.

444
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:22,620
You two eat it deliciously.

445
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:26,620
I'm really hungry.

446
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:28,620
Because.

447
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:30,620
I ate meaningless badminton.

448
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:33,620
I saw it on the monitor.

449
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:35,620
I don't know what it is.

450
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:37,620
I've never played badminton.

451
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:47,620
It's already 12 o'clock.

452
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:49,620
Let's eat dinner.

453
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:53,620
He will cook for us.

454
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:05,620
I'll make curry.

455
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:08,620
If you don't help me, I'll make curry.

456
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:09,620
I understand.

457
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:12,620
You don't cut the potatoes.

458
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:15,620
I'll fry the flour.

459
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:17,620
You fry flour.

460
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:19,620
It's too big.

461
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:22,620
I'll warm the frying pan.

462
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:24,620
I'm scared.

463
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:26,620
It's okay.

464
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:28,620
I'll do it slowly.

465
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:31,620
It's okay.

466
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:33,620
I'll hold it.

467
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:35,620
I'll fry this.

468
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:38,620
I'll do it slowly.

469
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:41,620
If it's too soft, I'll do it like this.

470
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:44,620
If you have a lot of hands, please do it like this.

471
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:46,620
Everyone is hungry.

472
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:49,620
I'll fry the onions.

473
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:51,620
Please do it.

474
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:53,620
I'm sorry.

475
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:59,620
I can't do it at all.

476
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:01,620
I can't do it at all.

477
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:03,620
It's okay.

478
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:05,620
Your reaction is weak.

479
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:08,620
Curry smells good.

480
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:10,620
It's okay.

481
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:14,620
I'll fry the potatoes.

482
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:16,620
I'll fry the onions.

483
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:21,620
What can you do?

484
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:23,620
Curry.

485
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:26,620
It doesn't rain.

486
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:29,620
Tomorrow afternoon will be hot.

487
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:31,620
I'm hungry.

488
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:34,620
I'll fry the potatoes.

489
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:37,620
I'm looking forward to what you can do.

490
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:39,620
I'm sorry.

491
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:42,620
I made it with a great tool.

492
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:44,620
I'm sorry.

493
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:50,620
This is the thing from before.

494
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:54,620
This is a curry rice made by SUMU.

495
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:57,620
Which is better than the fried rice made by TOMITOKU SHU?

496
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:59,620
Which is better than the fried rice made by TOMITOKU SHU?

497
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:01,620
Don't bite.

498
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:06,620
What kind of music is this?

499
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:18,620
Don't get too into it

500
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:24,620
It's done!

501
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:28,620
Is it a little spicy?

502
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:31,620
No, it's just right

503
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:34,620
This is balanced

504
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:37,620
For the time being, let's make it 20 people

505
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:41,620
For the remaining 980 people, please take the curry from this person

506
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:49,620
What is it?

507
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:51,620
Speaking of curry, it's Chi-Chi

508
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:53,620
It's Chi-Chi

509
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:55,620
If you don't have it, you can't come here

510
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:56,620
Are you going to pour it all over?

511
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:57,620
Of course

512
00:25:57,620 --> 00:25:59,620
Chi-Chi, smile

513
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:02,620
Don't be moody, smile

514
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:03,620
Shut up

515
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:06,620
You're eating so much

516
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:08,620
Don't be like that

517
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:11,620
It's delicious

518
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:14,620
It warms you up

519
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:16,620
Good evening

520
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:20,620
It's the timing you were aiming for

521
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:22,620
Did you all aim for this?

522
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:25,620
It's not like that

523
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:27,620
Are you going to pour it all over?

524
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:29,620
No

525
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:31,620
It's delicious, but I'm sorry

526
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:33,620
What are you talking about?

527
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:50,620
When there's something in your stomach, you want to sleep

528
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:52,620
That's right

529
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:54,620
Let's go

530
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:55,620
This is a strange time

531
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:57,620
I can't make a sumo club

532
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:01,620
Sumo club? Who's going to do it?

533
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,620
For the time being, let's start with 2 people

534
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:05,620
Master

535
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:07,620
I'll let you be the master

536
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:10,620
From now on, you're the master

537
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:14,620
Master

538
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:17,620
Master

539
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:24,620
Master

540
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:32,620
Master

541
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:36,620
Stop it

542
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:38,620
It's funny because it's this time

543
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:40,620
I'll do the whole thing

544
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:46,620
I'll do it all with bare hands

545
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:48,620
It's been a while

546
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:52,620
This time, many things

547
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:54,620
Karaoke

548
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:56,620
Case

549
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:01,620
Glasses

550
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:05,620
Necklace

551
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:07,620
I'm saying it

552
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:08,620
I heard it from the king!

553
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:10,620
No! I gave it to him!

554
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:13,620
Chikuwa

555
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:14,620
Wa

556
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:15,620
Wa

557
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:16,620
Wa

558
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:20,620
I'm Dai-chan!

559
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:30,620
Why did you become a word?

560
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:32,620
Tama-negi

561
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:34,620
Gisu-gisu

562
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:37,620
Why did you become a word?

563
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:38,620
Wan-wan-nyan-nyan

564
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:40,620
Repeating words

565
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:42,620
Isn't that a video game?

566
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:44,620
Kota-i

567
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:47,620
Say it

568
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:49,620
Mic

569
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:50,620
Mic

570
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:52,620
Kusu

571
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:55,620
Come

572
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:56,620
Okay, come

573
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:57,620
What is it?

574
00:28:57,620 --> 00:28:58,620
Explain it

575
00:28:58,620 --> 00:28:59,620
What is it?

576
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:02,620
Explain it so that I can understand

577
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:04,620
You're getting shy

578
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:05,620
What is it?

579
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:07,620
What is it?

580
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:08,620
You're laughing

581
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:10,620
It's kusu

582
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:11,620
What is kusu?

583
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:12,620
Say kusu

584
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:14,620
Kusu

585
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:19,620
Frisbee

586
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:21,620
Bee

587
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:23,620
Bee

588
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:24,620
Bisu

589
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:27,620
Come

590
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:30,620
Come

591
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:32,620
Are you the one who sat down?

592
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:34,620
I'm sorry

593
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:38,620
I'm scared

594
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:39,620
What is it?

595
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:40,620
I'm sorry

596
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:44,620
There are a lot of words in the world

597
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:47,620
What is it?

598
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:52,620
Donita Tsuchiya

599
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:53,620
Hello

600
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:56,620
Good evening

601
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:57,620
Good evening

602
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:00,620
It's 2 a.m.

603
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:02,620
7 hours have passed since the start

604
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:04,620
The audience's tiredness reaches its peak

605
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:06,620
But on stage

606
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:09,620
The talk of downtown will continue soon after the break

607
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:12,620
Why do people get older

608
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:14,620
When you become an old man and an old woman

609
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:15,620
Do you get smaller?

610
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:21,620
No, that's not true

611
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:23,620
I have a big old man

612
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:26,620
What is it?

613
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:37,620
Please teach me how to greet a fish

614
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:42,620
What is it?

615
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:51,620
It's like it's flying in the sky

616
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:55,620
This is good

617
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:56,620
Thank you

618
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:06,620
Thank you

619
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:12,620
Tamura Masakazu

620
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:19,620
Please teach me how to greet a fish

621
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:20,620
What is it?

622
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:23,620
When we first met

623
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:25,620
What was your first impression?

624
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:27,620
I was surprised too

625
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:28,620
Why?

626
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:31,620
I thought you were a high school student

627
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:34,620
Why is that?

628
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:39,620
You were wearing a long hair and pants

629
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:49,620
I thought you were a cameraman

630
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:53,620
Goodbye

631
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:01,620
I don't think I'll be able to shake your hand until tomorrow

632
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:02,620
That's the worst

633
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:04,620
That's the worst

634
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:10,620
You're wearing a headlock

635
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:14,620
Let's listen to the weather tomorrow

636
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:15,620
On the phone?

637
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:16,620
On the phone

638
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:18,620
I have to press D10

639
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:23,620
Shizuoka's weather forecast

640
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:27,620
Shizuoka's weather forecast

641
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:33,620
It's raining heavily in the western part of the prefecture

642
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:37,620
It's raining heavily in the central part of the prefecture

643
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:38,620
Please be careful

644
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:40,620
Please be careful

645
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:48,620
It's okay to sleep

646
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:52,620
We'll play here

647
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:54,620
Right?

648
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:57,620
I'm sorry

649
00:32:57,620 --> 00:32:59,620
I'm sorry

650
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:01,620
I had an unnecessary event

651
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:05,620
I'll start

652
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:13,620
That's strange

653
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:17,620
I don't want to

654
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:19,620
Hey

655
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:21,620
Hey

656
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:26,620
I came to Yoshimoto to do this

657
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:31,620
1, 2, 3, 4

658
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:33,620
4

659
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:46,620
That's nice

660
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:49,620
I laughed and went back to Tokyo

661
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:54,620
I have to wait for the rain to stop

662
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:58,620
The rain is getting stronger

663
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:00,620
There are times like this

664
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:04,620
I'm a little scared

665
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:10,620
Everyone

666
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:12,620
It's pouring

667
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:15,620
It's like

668
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:19,620
Totoro is coming out

669
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:24,620
I'm scared too

670
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:26,620
What is this rain?

671
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:32,620
Free-talk is a big problem

672
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:45,620
Do you know the intro of the movie?

673
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:47,620
Do you know what movie it is?

674
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:53,620
Yes

675
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:56,620
Emmanuel Fugin

676
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:59,620
Champion quiz

677
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:04,620
The next quiz is

678
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:05,620
It's not a movie

679
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:09,620
Guess the title of the song

680
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:11,620
I'll do it

681
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:14,620
Yesterday

682
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:18,620
Yes

683
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:20,620
Hamada-san

684
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:23,620
What is that?

685
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:28,620
That's amazing

686
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:30,620
Thank you

687
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:34,620
Grand champion quiz

688
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:38,620

689
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:40,620
Let's see

690
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:42,620
That's amazing

691
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:48,620
Yes

692
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:50,620
That's amazing

693
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:56,620
What are you turning?

694
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:05,620
That's amazing

695
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:10,620
No

696
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:20,620
Gag

697
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:22,620
50 times

698
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:29,620
Please look at me warmly

699
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:35,620
I won't tell anyone what I saw today

700
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:42,620
Good morning

701
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:46,620
Gag

702
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:48,620

703
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:53,620

704
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:59,620
Good morning

705
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:11,620
50 times

706
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:14,620
Good morning in France

707
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:22,620
Bonjour

708
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:24,620
Thank you

709
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:26,620
It's a big deal

710
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:29,620
If you do it, it will rain suddenly

711
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:31,620
That's right

712
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:35,620
Everyone will be fine

713
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:39,620
It's sunny over there

714
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:45,620
What was the weather forecast?

715
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:48,620
Let's do it together

716
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:50,620

720
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:55,620

721
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:57,620
6 people

722
00:37:57,620 --> 00:38:00,620
Good morning

723
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:04,620
Today's brother is Mr. Yukio Iketani

724
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:08,620
Good morning

725
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:10,620
Mr. Downtown is good too

726
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:11,620
Let's do it

727
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:14,620
Grand champion quiz

728
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:16,620
Please look at me

729
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:20,620
Raise your arms from the front

730
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:22,620
It's a big movement

731
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:32,620
It's a hand-and-foot movement

732
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:38,620
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8

733
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:40,620
I'm tired

734
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:44,620
3, 2, 1, 2, 3

735
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:46,620
I'm tired

736
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:48,620
I'm very tired

737
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:50,620
3, 2, 1, 2

738
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:52,620
Hand-and-foot movement

739
00:38:52,620 --> 00:39:02,620
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8

740
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:03,620
Thank you

741
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:06,620
Please give me a gold medal

742
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:10,620
I'm still half way through

743
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:12,620
That's good

744
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:15,620
It's 7 a.m. and 12 hours before the start

745
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:17,620
They finally pass the starting point

746
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:21,620
The tired body wakes up and the venue starts to get back on track

747
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:25,620
Everyone is eating something

748
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:27,620
I'm eating a banana

749
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:29,620
You're eating a banana?

750
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:31,620
It's a pear

751
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:33,620
A pear is delicious

752
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:38,620
If you have a pear, you can eat as much rice as you want

753
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:42,620
What newspaper?

754
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:44,620
Are you ready?

755
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:49,620
Browse 970

756
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:53,620
You don't need to know that kind of information

757
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:56,620
His left hand is looking at me

758
00:39:58,620 --> 00:40:01,620
Is it a novel?

759
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:04,620

1, 2, 3, 4

781
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:15,620

785
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:27,620
What is this?

786
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:30,620
I don't need a man

787
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:32,620
Is it a woman?

788
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:34,620
Of course

789
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:43,620
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8

790
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:47,620
I'll leave the big ones

791
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:51,620
1

792
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:55,620
Teacher, you like this, don't you?

793
00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:58,620
It's not about whether you like it or not

794
00:41:58,620 --> 00:42:03,620
1, 2

795
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:05,620

00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:23,620

5, 6, 7, 8

804
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:37,620
Isn't there a song that goes well with this?

805
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:39,620
Look for it

806
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:41,620
I'll dance to it

807
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:43,620

808
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:45,620

812
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:08,620
You're slow and fast

813
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:09,620
It's hard

814
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:13,620
That's what the teacher thinks

815
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:15,620
Teacher Izumi

816
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:17,620
I don't know that

817
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:19,620
I'm not doing it

818
00:43:19,620 --> 00:43:22,620
Where did it end?

819
00:43:22,620 --> 00:43:26,620
It's a difficult part

820
00:43:26,620 --> 00:43:30,620
1

821
00:43:30,620 --> 00:43:32,620

822
00:43:32,620 --> 00:43:33,620
3

823
00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:37,620
It's cool

824
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:40,620
Look at each other

825
00:43:40,620 --> 00:43:42,620
Like this

826
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:45,620
Look at me when I say 1

827
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:47,620
Like this

828
00:43:47,620 --> 00:43:53,620
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8

829
00:43:57,620 --> 00:43:59,620
From the beginning

830
00:43:59,620 --> 00:44:04,620
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8

831
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:08,620
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8

832
00:44:08,620 --> 00:44:13,620
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8

833
00:44:13,620 --> 00:44:17,620
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8

834
00:44:17,620 --> 00:44:22,620
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8

835
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:29,620
I decided the music for the concert

836
00:44:29,620 --> 00:44:32,620
I'll do it according to this

837
00:44:32,620 --> 00:44:34,620
Let's go

838
00:44:34,620 --> 00:44:38,620
Your birthday

839
00:44:38,620 --> 00:44:40,620
Your birthday

840
00:44:40,620 --> 00:44:43,620
1, 2, 3, 4

841
00:44:59,620 --> 00:45:02,620
Stop

842
00:45:02,620 --> 00:45:05,620
I'm sorry

843
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:08,620
Go home

844
00:45:08,620 --> 00:45:11,620
Go home

845
00:45:11,620 --> 00:45:39,620
Music start

846
00:45:39,620 --> 00:45:47,620
Music start

847
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:52,620
Applause

848
00:45:52,620 --> 00:45:55,620
It's not good

849
00:45:55,620 --> 00:45:56,620
Why?

850
00:45:56,620 --> 00:46:01,620
Didn't you hear when I said Takane no Hana yo?

851
00:46:01,620 --> 00:46:02,620
When?

852
00:46:02,620 --> 00:46:07,620
Takane no Hana yo

853
00:46:07,620 --> 00:46:09,620
Amazing

854
00:46:09,620 --> 00:46:10,620
I can't hear

855
00:46:10,620 --> 00:46:14,620
Why are you sighing?

856
00:46:14,620 --> 00:46:15,620
Do you understand?

857
00:46:15,620 --> 00:46:16,620
I don't understand

858
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:18,620
I'll do it later

859
00:46:18,620 --> 00:46:20,620
Natsukashi concert

860
00:46:20,620 --> 00:46:22,620
Start

861
00:46:26,620 --> 00:46:29,620
I might really fall

862
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:34,620
It's hot

863
00:46:34,620 --> 00:46:39,620
It's so hot

864
00:46:39,620 --> 00:46:42,620
It's so hot

865
00:46:42,620 --> 00:46:44,620
What should I do?

866
00:46:44,620 --> 00:46:48,620
This is good

867
00:46:48,620 --> 00:46:50,620
It's so cool

868
00:46:50,620 --> 00:46:53,620
It's spinning

869
00:46:53,620 --> 00:46:55,620
It's spinning

870
00:46:55,620 --> 00:46:57,620
It's good

871
00:46:57,620 --> 00:47:01,620
If I sing in the rain

872
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:03,620
It's good

873
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:08,620
Hey

874
00:47:08,620 --> 00:47:11,620
I don't like it

875
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:18,620
If I take it like this

876
00:47:18,620 --> 00:47:24,620
I wonder if it's good for the futon at home

877
00:47:24,620 --> 00:47:28,620
I'll do it

878
00:47:28,620 --> 00:47:33,620
I'll do it

879
00:47:33,620 --> 00:47:40,620
My honeymoon

880
00:47:40,620 --> 00:47:42,620
Hello

881
00:47:42,620 --> 00:47:43,620
I'm Yuma

882
00:47:43,620 --> 00:47:45,620
Yuma?

883
00:47:45,620 --> 00:47:50,620
My name is Yuma

884
00:47:50,620 --> 00:47:56,620
I'll introduce myself

885
00:47:56,620 --> 00:47:57,620
Hello, I'm Kenji

886
00:47:57,620 --> 00:47:59,620
Wait

887
00:47:59,620 --> 00:48:01,620
You said Yuma, so you introduced yourself like Gorohase

888
00:48:01,620 --> 00:48:03,620
Are you going to be Kenji again?

889
00:48:03,620 --> 00:48:06,620
There's a wedding season

890
00:48:06,620 --> 00:48:09,620
Where do you want to go on your honeymoon?

891
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:11,620
There's a lot of places

892
00:48:11,620 --> 00:48:15,620
I want to go to Hawaii

893
00:48:15,620 --> 00:48:17,620
I want to go to a hot place

894
00:48:17,620 --> 00:48:18,620
Hawaii

895
00:48:18,620 --> 00:48:22,620
I want to go to a hot place

896
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:24,620
There's a lot of places

897
00:48:24,620 --> 00:48:27,620
There's a lot of places

898
00:48:27,620 --> 00:48:32,620
I want to go to Shoya

899
00:48:32,620 --> 00:48:33,620
Shoya

900
00:48:33,620 --> 00:48:35,620
This is hard

901
00:48:35,620 --> 00:48:41,620
I'm nervous

902
00:48:41,620 --> 00:48:42,620
Hanako

903
00:48:42,620 --> 00:48:43,620
Yes

904
00:48:43,620 --> 00:48:45,620
I got a first class hotel

905
00:48:45,620 --> 00:48:47,620
I'm happy

906
00:48:47,620 --> 00:48:49,620
It's a suite room

907
00:48:49,620 --> 00:48:52,620
Let's go in

908
00:48:52,620 --> 00:48:54,620
I'll open it

909
00:48:54,620 --> 00:48:56,620
Why?

910
00:48:56,620 --> 00:48:58,620
It's a first class hotel

911
00:48:58,620 --> 00:48:59,620
You can't say that

912
00:48:59,620 --> 00:49:05,620
It's a suite room

913
00:49:05,620 --> 00:49:07,620
It's a small suite room

914
00:49:07,620 --> 00:49:08,620
It's a suite room

915
00:49:08,620 --> 00:49:10,620
It's a suite room

916
00:49:10,620 --> 00:49:12,620
It's a big room

917
00:49:12,620 --> 00:49:14,620
It's a big room

918
00:49:14,620 --> 00:49:17,620
Why are you saying it like that?

919
00:49:17,620 --> 00:49:23,620
Don't raise it

920
00:49:23,620 --> 00:49:25,620
It's here, Hanako

921
00:49:25,620 --> 00:49:27,620
That's amazing

922
00:49:27,620 --> 00:49:29,620
The time has finally come

923
00:49:29,620 --> 00:49:30,620
I'm sorry

924
00:49:30,620 --> 00:49:32,620
Can you turn off the light?

925
00:49:32,620 --> 00:49:33,620
Light?

926
00:49:33,620 --> 00:49:36,620
I'll turn it off

927
00:49:36,620 --> 00:49:41,620
Stop it

928
00:49:41,620 --> 00:49:43,620
It's a first class hotel

929
00:49:43,620 --> 00:49:46,620
It's a suite room

930
00:49:46,620 --> 00:49:49,620
Why is it a candle?

931
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:50,620
I'll turn off the light

932
00:49:50,620 --> 00:49:53,620
Turn it off

933
00:49:53,620 --> 00:49:54,620
Stop it

934
00:49:54,620 --> 00:49:57,620
Don't loosen it

935
00:49:57,620 --> 00:50:00,620
Use the button

936
00:50:00,620 --> 00:50:02,620
Wait for me

937
00:50:02,620 --> 00:50:03,620
Yes

938
00:50:03,620 --> 00:50:06,620
I'll take off my clothes

939
00:50:06,620 --> 00:50:08,620
Sabah

940
00:50:08,620 --> 00:50:11,620
Look at this, Hanako

941
00:50:11,620 --> 00:50:13,620
It's embarrassing

942
00:50:13,620 --> 00:50:14,620
What are you saying?

943
00:50:14,620 --> 00:50:16,620
Hanako

944
00:50:16,620 --> 00:50:19,620
Stop it

945
00:50:19,620 --> 00:50:25,620
It's a first class hotel

946
00:50:25,620 --> 00:50:26,620
Hanako, you are

947
00:50:26,620 --> 00:50:28,620
It's a first class hotel

948
00:50:28,620 --> 00:50:32,620
You're not a woman

949
00:50:32,620 --> 00:50:34,620
Smile

950
00:50:34,620 --> 00:50:40,620
Thank you

951
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:45,620
I'll talk to Yamazaki for 30 minutes

952
00:50:45,620 --> 00:50:52,620
I'll talk to Yamazaki for 30 minutes

953
00:50:52,620 --> 00:50:54,620
It's too early

954
00:50:54,620 --> 00:50:56,620
I'm sorry

955
00:50:56,620 --> 00:51:00,620
It's a first class hotel

956
00:51:00,620 --> 00:51:05,620
It's a first class hotel

957
00:51:05,620 --> 00:51:07,620
It's a first class hotel

958
00:51:07,620 --> 00:51:09,620
Thank you

959
00:51:09,620 --> 00:51:13,620
I'm doing a manzai

960
00:51:13,620 --> 00:51:15,620
It's not profitable

961
00:51:15,620 --> 00:51:17,620
There are many profitable businesses

962
00:51:17,620 --> 00:51:20,620
It's about 40 million yen

963
00:51:20,620 --> 00:51:22,620
That's too much

964
00:51:22,620 --> 00:51:25,620
The doctor is the coolest

965
00:51:25,620 --> 00:51:29,620
The doctors are good at surgery

966
00:51:29,620 --> 00:51:31,620
I don't want to see it

967
00:51:31,620 --> 00:51:35,620
I'm nervous

968
00:51:35,620 --> 00:51:38,620
Doctor

969
00:51:38,620 --> 00:51:40,620
It's a first class hotel

970
00:51:40,620 --> 00:51:41,620
It's a first class hotel

971
00:51:41,620 --> 00:51:43,620
Woman

972
00:51:43,620 --> 00:51:45,620
Yes

973
00:51:45,620 --> 00:51:48,620
Woman

974
00:51:48,620 --> 00:51:49,620
Yes

975
00:51:49,620 --> 00:51:50,620
Woman

976
00:51:50,620 --> 00:51:55,620
It's just a woman

977
00:51:55,620 --> 00:51:57,620
Woman

978
00:51:57,620 --> 00:52:00,620
Kiss

979
00:52:00,620 --> 00:52:03,620
Woman

980
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:07,620
Hey

981
00:52:07,620 --> 00:52:09,620
Can I dance?

982
00:52:09,620 --> 00:52:11,620
I'll cut it

983
00:52:11,620 --> 00:52:15,620
Please

984
00:52:15,620 --> 00:52:20,620
How far are you going to cut it?

985
00:52:20,620 --> 00:52:21,620
I know

986
00:52:21,620 --> 00:52:22,620
Look at it

987
00:52:22,620 --> 00:52:23,620
I won't

988
00:52:23,620 --> 00:52:24,620
I know

989
00:52:24,620 --> 00:52:26,620
What kind of situation is it?

990
00:52:26,620 --> 00:52:28,620
It's a traffic accident

991
00:52:28,620 --> 00:52:29,620
Traffic accident?

992
00:52:29,620 --> 00:52:30,620
Yes

993
00:52:30,620 --> 00:52:31,620
I see

994
00:52:31,620 --> 00:52:32,620
It's going to happen

995
00:52:32,620 --> 00:52:33,620
What?

996
00:52:33,620 --> 00:52:34,620
It's going to happen

997
00:52:34,620 --> 00:52:35,620
It's going to happen

998
00:52:35,620 --> 00:52:38,620
Look at it

999
00:52:38,620 --> 00:52:40,620
It's a car

1000
00:52:40,620 --> 00:52:42,620
Look at it

1001
00:52:42,620 --> 00:52:44,620
Sweat

1002
00:52:44,620 --> 00:52:47,620
tweezers

1003
00:52:47,620 --> 00:52:48,620
Kikunohana

1004
00:52:48,620 --> 00:52:50,620
It's dead

1005
00:52:50,620 --> 00:52:55,620
Thank you

1006
00:52:55,620 --> 00:52:58,620
Let's think about the second one

1007
00:52:58,620 --> 00:53:03,620
Yamazaki

1008
00:53:03,620 --> 00:53:05,620
Kareena Deka

1009
00:53:05,620 --> 00:53:06,620
I got it

1010
00:53:06,620 --> 00:53:07,620
Just

1011
00:53:07,620 --> 00:53:09,620
Just this time

1012
00:53:09,620 --> 00:53:12,620
I'm nervous

1013
00:53:12,620 --> 00:53:13,620
Kareena Deka

1014
00:53:13,620 --> 00:53:16,620
Please

1015
00:53:16,620 --> 00:53:17,620
Hello

1016
00:53:17,620 --> 00:53:18,620
Hello

1017
00:53:18,620 --> 00:53:20,620
I don't want to do it

1018
00:53:20,620 --> 00:53:21,620
I don't want to do it

1019
00:53:21,620 --> 00:53:22,620
It's not cool

1020
00:53:22,620 --> 00:53:24,620
There are many jobs

1021
00:53:24,620 --> 00:53:25,620
It's cool

1022
00:53:25,620 --> 00:53:26,620
The detective is cool

1023
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:27,620
The detective is cool

1024
00:53:27,620 --> 00:53:28,620
It's a detective drama

1025
00:53:28,620 --> 00:53:29,620
It's cool

1026
00:53:29,620 --> 00:53:30,620
Really?

1027
00:53:30,620 --> 00:53:33,620
It's going to be hard

1028
00:53:33,620 --> 00:53:36,620
Is this a murder scene?

1029
00:53:36,620 --> 00:53:39,620
Deka-cho

1030
00:53:39,620 --> 00:53:40,620
Hello

1031
00:53:40,620 --> 00:53:43,620
I'm Deka-cho

1032
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:45,620
Nice to meet you

1033
00:53:45,620 --> 00:53:48,620
Nice to meet you

1034
00:53:48,620 --> 00:53:50,620
Where is the office?

1035
00:53:50,620 --> 00:53:55,620
Here

1036
00:53:55,620 --> 00:53:56,620
It's closed

1037
00:53:56,620 --> 00:53:58,620
Why?

1038
00:53:58,620 --> 00:53:59,620
It's closed

1039
00:53:59,620 --> 00:54:00,620
I know

1040
00:54:00,620 --> 00:54:01,620
This is terrible

1041
00:54:01,620 --> 00:54:02,620
That's right

1042
00:54:02,620 --> 00:54:04,620
There is a knife inside

1043
00:54:04,620 --> 00:54:06,620
This is a professional trick

1044
00:54:06,620 --> 00:54:08,620
This is a murder

1045
00:54:08,620 --> 00:54:09,620
Really?

1046
00:54:09,620 --> 00:54:12,620
But it's a case of a lake

1047
00:54:12,620 --> 00:54:13,620
That's right

1048
00:54:13,620 --> 00:54:14,620
It's a murder

1049
00:54:14,620 --> 00:54:17,620
It's outside

1050
00:54:17,620 --> 00:54:18,620
I'm not talking about the lake

1051
00:54:18,620 --> 00:54:19,620
I know

1052
00:54:19,620 --> 00:54:20,620
This is a knife

1053
00:54:20,620 --> 00:54:25,620
That's right

1054
00:54:25,620 --> 00:54:26,620
It's heroin

1055
00:54:26,620 --> 00:54:27,620
It's blood

1056
00:54:27,620 --> 00:54:28,620
It's hot

1057
00:54:28,620 --> 00:54:29,620
I know

1058
00:54:29,620 --> 00:54:31,620
This is terrible

1059
00:54:31,620 --> 00:54:32,620
Yes

1060
00:54:32,620 --> 00:54:33,620
What?

1061
00:54:33,620 --> 00:54:34,620
What is this situation?

1062
00:54:34,620 --> 00:54:35,620
I know

1063
00:54:35,620 --> 00:54:36,620
Shut up

1064
00:54:36,620 --> 00:54:37,620
Don't say it again

1065
00:54:37,620 --> 00:54:38,620
Yes

1066
00:54:38,620 --> 00:54:40,620
I'm sorry

1067
00:54:40,620 --> 00:54:42,620
I'm a great veteran of this road

1068
00:54:42,620 --> 00:54:43,620
That's right

1069
00:54:43,620 --> 00:54:44,620
You're not bad

1070
00:54:44,620 --> 00:54:47,620
This is a miracle

1071
00:54:47,620 --> 00:54:48,620
Yes

1072
00:54:48,620 --> 00:54:50,620
I don't know what it is

1073
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:52,620
A miracle

1074
00:54:52,620 --> 00:54:53,620
A miracle

1075
00:54:53,620 --> 00:54:55,620
Yes

1076
00:54:55,620 --> 00:54:56,620
A miracle

1077
00:54:56,620 --> 00:54:57,620
Yes

1078
00:54:57,620 --> 00:54:58,620
Hold on

1079
00:54:58,620 --> 00:54:59,620
Yes

1080
00:54:59,620 --> 00:55:01,620
I'm a great veteran

1081
00:55:01,620 --> 00:55:04,620
What are you talking about?

1082
00:55:04,620 --> 00:55:05,620
What?

1083
00:55:05,620 --> 00:55:06,620
I'm a great veteran

1084
00:55:06,620 --> 00:55:07,620
Hold on

1085
00:55:07,620 --> 00:55:08,620
I'm holding on

1086
00:55:08,620 --> 00:55:09,620
I'm fine

1087
00:55:09,620 --> 00:55:10,620
Yes

1088
00:55:10,620 --> 00:55:11,620
What?

1089
00:55:11,620 --> 00:55:12,620
Ah

1090
00:55:12,620 --> 00:55:13,620
This is a trick

1091
00:55:13,620 --> 00:55:15,620
Yes

1092
00:55:15,620 --> 00:55:17,620
I think this is his trick

1093
00:55:17,620 --> 00:55:18,620
What?

1094
00:55:18,620 --> 00:55:19,620
What do you mean?

1095
00:55:19,620 --> 00:55:20,620
It was about 5 years ago

1096
00:55:20,620 --> 00:55:21,620
Yes

1097
00:55:21,620 --> 00:55:22,620
It was a similar murder

1098
00:55:22,620 --> 00:55:24,620
There were several serial murders

1099
00:55:24,620 --> 00:55:25,620
Is that so?

1100
00:55:25,620 --> 00:55:27,620
But we managed to catch him

1101
00:55:27,620 --> 00:55:28,620
Yes

1102
00:55:28,620 --> 00:55:29,620
He saved his life

1103
00:55:29,620 --> 00:55:32,620
Don't talk nonsense

1104
00:55:32,620 --> 00:55:34,620
He's a bad guy

1105
00:55:34,620 --> 00:55:36,620
That's right

1106
00:55:36,620 --> 00:55:38,620
He's very similar to that

1107
00:55:38,620 --> 00:55:39,620
I'll tell him it's a trick

1108
00:55:39,620 --> 00:55:40,620
I see

1109
00:55:40,620 --> 00:55:41,620
Is that so?

1110
00:55:41,620 --> 00:55:42,620
What is this?

1111
00:55:42,620 --> 00:55:43,620
Ah

1112
00:55:43,620 --> 00:55:44,620
Isn't this a costume?

1113
00:55:44,620 --> 00:55:45,620
A costume?

1114
00:55:45,620 --> 00:55:46,620
Yes

1115
00:55:46,620 --> 00:55:49,620
I don't want to think about anything in this world

1116
00:55:49,620 --> 00:55:50,620
I'll go on my own

1117
00:55:50,620 --> 00:55:51,620
I got it

1118
00:55:51,620 --> 00:55:52,620
What?

1119
00:55:52,620 --> 00:55:53,620
You're the culprit

1120
00:55:53,620 --> 00:55:55,620
I'll kill myself

1121
00:56:01,620 --> 00:56:02,620
Helicopter

1122
00:56:02,620 --> 00:56:03,620
Yes

1123
00:56:05,620 --> 00:56:07,620
Let's have fun

1124
00:56:07,620 --> 00:56:08,620
Are you ready?

1125
00:56:14,620 --> 00:56:16,620
I'm glad I read the history

1126
00:56:16,620 --> 00:56:17,620
Why?

1127
00:56:17,620 --> 00:56:20,620
This is the first time I've seen them all together

1128
00:56:20,620 --> 00:56:23,620
I've never seen this many drug addicts

1129
00:56:23,620 --> 00:56:25,620
How can you do this?

1130
00:56:25,620 --> 00:56:27,620
I've started to feel the power of the last one

1131
00:56:27,620 --> 00:56:29,620
Thank you

1132
00:56:29,620 --> 00:56:33,620
Can you say this line?

1133
00:56:33,620 --> 00:56:35,620
I'm frustrated

1134
00:56:35,620 --> 00:56:37,620
That's normal

1135
00:56:37,620 --> 00:56:39,620
You can sing it

1136
00:56:39,620 --> 00:56:52,620
I'm frustrated

1137
00:56:52,620 --> 00:56:54,620
Let's draw

1138
00:56:54,620 --> 00:56:55,620
Ha

1139
00:56:55,620 --> 00:56:56,620
Na

1140
00:56:56,620 --> 00:56:57,620
Ha

1141
00:56:57,620 --> 00:57:05,620
Ha

1142
00:57:05,620 --> 00:57:10,620
Drawing is fun

1143
00:57:10,620 --> 00:57:14,620
Drawing

1144
00:57:14,620 --> 00:57:16,620
I'm crying

1145
00:57:16,620 --> 00:57:18,620
Ha

1146
00:57:25,620 --> 00:57:29,620
I'm frustrated

1147
00:57:29,620 --> 00:57:30,620
Show me

1148
00:57:30,620 --> 00:57:31,620
Yes

1149
00:57:39,620 --> 00:57:41,620
It's hot

1150
00:57:41,620 --> 00:57:51,620
It's so hot

1151
00:57:51,620 --> 00:57:52,620
It's hot

1152
00:57:52,620 --> 00:57:59,620
It's dark here

1153
00:57:59,620 --> 00:58:02,620
I

1154
00:58:02,620 --> 00:58:06,620
I want to go home

1155
00:58:06,620 --> 00:58:10,620
I only have Yamazaki

1156
00:58:10,620 --> 00:58:14,620
Do I have to rely on him?

1157
00:58:14,620 --> 00:58:17,620
Will I die?

1158
00:58:17,620 --> 00:58:19,620
You won't die

1159
00:58:22,620 --> 00:58:24,620
You won't die

1160
00:58:24,620 --> 00:58:26,620
I want to go home

1161
00:58:32,620 --> 00:58:34,620
Let's practice

1162
00:58:34,620 --> 00:58:44,620
Let's get in the mood

1163
00:58:44,620 --> 00:58:47,620
But

1164
00:58:47,620 --> 00:58:50,620
It's cold

1165
00:58:50,620 --> 00:58:52,620
There's a wind

1166
00:58:52,620 --> 00:58:55,620
It's getting dark

1167
00:58:55,620 --> 00:58:57,620
It's easy

1168
00:58:57,620 --> 00:59:00,620
It's easy

1169
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:07,620
You can do it in 2 and a half hours

1170
00:59:07,620 --> 00:59:11,620
You don't have to do it anymore

1171
00:59:11,620 --> 00:59:15,620
You can do it

1172
00:59:18,620 --> 00:59:20,620
Marina is here

1173
00:59:20,620 --> 00:59:22,620
Marina

1174
00:59:22,620 --> 00:59:30,620
You're so slow

1175
00:59:30,620 --> 00:59:34,620
Marina, don't take off your sailor clothes

1176
00:59:34,620 --> 00:59:37,620
Wait a minute

1177
00:59:37,620 --> 00:59:44,620
Don't take off your sailor clothes

1178
00:59:44,620 --> 00:59:45,620
No

1179
00:59:45,620 --> 00:59:47,620
You can't do it now

1180
00:59:47,620 --> 00:59:50,620
Be patient

1181
00:59:50,620 --> 00:59:52,620
You don't have to dance

1182
00:59:52,620 --> 00:59:53,620
I forgot

1183
00:59:53,620 --> 00:59:57,620
It's a little scary

1184
00:59:57,620 --> 01:00:01,620
But it's not boring

1185
01:00:01,620 --> 01:00:05,620
Before it's too late

1186
01:00:05,620 --> 01:00:14,620
Eat a delicious heart

1187
01:00:14,620 --> 01:00:20,620
Eat a delicious heart

1188
01:00:20,620 --> 01:00:22,620
Everyone has a refreshing face

1189
01:00:22,620 --> 01:00:23,620
Yes

1190
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:25,620
Human beings are great

1191
01:00:25,620 --> 01:00:27,620
There is a biorhythm

1192
01:00:27,620 --> 01:00:28,620
There were many times

1193
01:00:28,620 --> 01:00:31,620
Yamatani, Yamatani

1194
01:00:31,620 --> 01:00:36,620
The face at the time of the valley is amazing

1195
01:00:36,620 --> 01:00:38,620
Everyone was there

1196
01:00:38,620 --> 01:00:40,620
There were customers

1197
01:00:40,620 --> 01:00:42,620
There were many people

1198
01:00:42,620 --> 01:00:47,620
The boss was this person

1199
01:00:47,620 --> 01:00:48,620
Boss

1200
01:00:48,620 --> 01:00:50,620
You were there once

1201
01:00:50,620 --> 01:00:52,620
In the corner

1202
01:00:52,620 --> 01:00:56,620
There was a rooster

1203
01:00:56,620 --> 01:00:59,620
I was surprised

1204
01:00:59,620 --> 01:01:02,620
I stopped and moved

1205
01:01:02,620 --> 01:01:08,620
I thought it was a story of an old lady

1206
01:01:08,620 --> 01:01:13,620
We danced together

1207
01:01:13,620 --> 01:01:15,620
What?

1208
01:01:15,620 --> 01:01:17,620
Do you want to see?

1209
01:01:17,620 --> 01:01:20,620
I want to see

1210
01:01:20,620 --> 01:01:21,620
I want to see

1211
01:01:21,620 --> 01:01:49,620
I want to see

1212
01:01:49,620 --> 01:02:05,620
I want to see

1213
01:02:05,620 --> 01:02:07,620
You look happy

1214
01:02:07,620 --> 01:02:10,620
Your smile when you were doing this

1215
01:02:10,620 --> 01:02:12,620
It was really amazing

1216
01:02:12,620 --> 01:02:14,620
It's dirty

1217
01:02:14,620 --> 01:02:19,620
The dirtiest smile

1218
01:02:19,620 --> 01:02:23,620
I want you to clap

1219
01:02:23,620 --> 01:02:30,620
I don't like it

1220
01:02:30,620 --> 01:02:35,620
You are completely different

1221
01:02:35,620 --> 01:02:37,620
You have a blue face

1222
01:02:37,620 --> 01:02:42,620
You have a blue face

1223
01:02:42,620 --> 01:02:46,620
You haven't done it

1224
01:02:46,620 --> 01:03:13,620
I want to see

1225
01:03:13,620 --> 01:03:21,620
I want to see

1226
01:03:21,620 --> 01:03:26,620
Hamada, you're the first one

1227
01:03:26,620 --> 01:03:28,620
Stop laughing

1228
01:03:28,620 --> 01:03:42,620
You can go home

1229
01:03:42,620 --> 01:03:44,620
What are you doing?

1230
01:03:44,620 --> 01:03:47,620
You can go home

1231
01:03:47,620 --> 01:03:49,620
Nimi sensei

1232
01:03:49,620 --> 01:03:54,620
Thank you

1233
01:03:54,620 --> 01:03:56,620
It was an unexpected guest

1234
01:03:56,620 --> 01:04:05,620
It's an unexpected dancer

1235
01:04:05,620 --> 01:04:10,620
Let's practice dancing

1236
01:04:10,620 --> 01:04:16,620
Let's start with boxing

1237
01:04:16,620 --> 01:04:20,620
1,2,3,4,5,6,7

1238
01:04:20,620 --> 01:04:25,620
Are you okay?

1239
01:04:25,620 --> 01:04:31,620
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8

1240
01:04:31,620 --> 01:04:36,620
You can go home

1241
01:04:36,620 --> 01:04:39,620
Thank you

1242
01:04:39,620 --> 01:04:44,620
You have to go higher

1243
01:04:44,620 --> 01:04:50,620
Higher

1244
01:04:50,620 --> 01:05:03,620
5,6,7

1245
01:05:03,620 --> 01:05:13,620
Let's start from here

1246
01:05:13,620 --> 01:05:18,620
Are you stupid?

1247
01:05:18,620 --> 01:05:26,620
I'm okay

1248
01:05:26,620 --> 01:05:28,620
I'm watching you

1249
01:05:28,620 --> 01:05:32,620
Please do it

1250
01:05:32,620 --> 01:05:52,620
It's tiring to teach 4 people

1251
01:05:52,620 --> 01:06:04,620
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8

1252
01:06:04,620 --> 01:06:06,620
No,no,no

1253
01:06:06,620 --> 01:06:08,620
Sensei, please

1254
01:06:08,620 --> 01:06:13,620
Smile more

1255
01:06:13,620 --> 01:06:15,620
Let's go

1256
01:06:15,620 --> 01:06:40,620
1,2,3,4

1257
01:06:40,620 --> 01:06:47,620
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8

1258
01:06:47,620 --> 01:06:49,620
Who was bad?

1259
01:06:49,620 --> 01:06:51,620
Who was bad?

1260
01:06:51,620 --> 01:06:52,620
Everyone was bad?

1261
01:06:52,620 --> 01:06:55,620
That's not good

1262
01:06:55,620 --> 01:06:57,620
What?

1263
01:06:57,620 --> 01:07:01,620
Can you do it?

1264
01:07:01,620 --> 01:07:03,620
From Tokyo

1265
01:07:03,620 --> 01:07:06,620
I was free

1266
01:07:06,620 --> 01:07:07,620
You were free?

1267
01:07:07,620 --> 01:07:09,620
The drama is over

1268
01:07:09,620 --> 01:07:12,620
You played a bad role

1269
01:07:12,620 --> 01:07:18,620
The drama will be called Dancer from tomorrow

1270
01:07:18,620 --> 01:07:20,620
From tomorrow

1271
01:07:20,620 --> 01:07:23,620
If you do it, it will be extra

1272
01:07:23,620 --> 01:07:31,620
Let's make a team and go to business

1273
01:07:31,620 --> 01:07:33,620
What?

1274
01:07:33,620 --> 01:07:37,620
You're the only one who thinks about it

1275
01:07:37,620 --> 01:07:39,620
That's amazing

1276
01:07:39,620 --> 01:07:45,620
If you do it well, it will be amazing

1277
01:07:45,620 --> 01:07:54,620
If you do it well, you will get a UFO

1278
01:07:54,620 --> 01:08:00,620
Let's get a UFO

1279
01:08:00,620 --> 01:08:07,620
Stand up and I will look at you

1280
01:08:07,620 --> 01:08:13,620
Everyone remembers

1281
01:08:13,620 --> 01:08:28,620
Look, they are practicing

1282
01:08:28,620 --> 01:08:56,620
3,2,1

1283
01:08:56,620 --> 01:09:05,620
You guys are scary

1284
01:09:05,620 --> 01:09:13,620
You guys are good

1285
01:09:13,620 --> 01:09:18,620
Let's do it

1286
01:09:18,620 --> 01:09:27,620
Stand up

1287
01:09:27,620 --> 01:09:44,620
1,2,3,4

1288
01:09:44,620 --> 01:09:53,620
1,2,3,4

1289
01:09:53,620 --> 01:09:58,620
You guys are turning the wrong way

1290
01:09:58,620 --> 01:10:01,620
You can stop

1291
01:10:01,620 --> 01:10:05,620
It's amazing

1292
01:10:05,620 --> 01:10:10,620
It's funny that time has passed

1293
01:10:10,620 --> 01:10:17,620
The time has passed

1294
01:10:17,620 --> 01:10:19,620
It's fast

1295
01:10:19,620 --> 01:10:30,620
It's been an hour

1296
01:10:30,620 --> 01:10:32,620
One last time

1297
01:10:32,620 --> 01:10:42,620
Please give me everything you have

1298
01:10:42,620 --> 01:10:52,620
Music start

1299
01:10:52,620 --> 01:11:14,620
3,2,1

1300
01:11:14,620 --> 01:11:20,620
OK

1301
01:11:20,620 --> 01:11:24,620
It's amazing that there's no one who hasn't done it

1302
01:11:24,620 --> 01:11:27,620
It's moving

1303
01:11:27,620 --> 01:11:29,620
It's amazing

1304
01:11:29,620 --> 01:11:32,620
There are couples inside

1305
01:11:32,620 --> 01:11:38,620
My girlfriend is dancing

1306
01:11:38,620 --> 01:11:41,620
I'm like that too

1307
01:11:41,620 --> 01:11:45,620
Music start

1308
01:11:45,620 --> 01:11:51,620
It's been 24 hours

1309
01:11:51,620 --> 01:11:56,620
It's been 19 minutes

1310
01:11:56,620 --> 01:11:58,620
It's fast

1311
01:11:58,620 --> 01:12:07,620
It's annoying

1312
01:12:07,620 --> 01:12:15,620
I was like, should I stop or go home?

1313
01:12:15,620 --> 01:12:18,620
But it's been 19 minutes

1314
01:12:18,620 --> 01:12:24,620
I'm wondering if this was good

1315
01:12:24,620 --> 01:12:30,620
I have a lot of memories

1316
01:12:30,620 --> 01:12:40,620
What was the most memorable for you?

1317
01:12:40,620 --> 01:12:47,620
When Hideki came out and did IMCA, everyone's smile

1318
01:12:47,620 --> 01:12:50,620
I'll never forget it

1319
01:12:50,620 --> 01:12:53,620
I just realized

1320
01:12:53,620 --> 01:12:58,620
These people want to dance

1321
01:12:58,620 --> 01:13:08,620
That's why I told you to dance

1322
01:13:08,620 --> 01:13:18,620
Everyone's butt must hurt

1323
01:13:18,620 --> 01:13:24,620
Thank you

1324
01:13:24,620 --> 01:13:27,620
Everyone worked hard

1325
01:13:27,620 --> 01:13:31,620
Everyone worked hard today

1326
01:13:31,620 --> 01:13:35,620
It's a record

1327
01:13:35,620 --> 01:13:37,620
It's been a minute

1328
01:13:37,620 --> 01:13:43,620
Thank you everyone

1329
01:13:43,620 --> 01:13:48,620
Let's count down together

1330
01:13:48,620 --> 01:13:51,620
It's fast

1331
01:13:51,620 --> 01:13:55,620
Let's count down together

1332
01:13:55,620 --> 01:13:58,620
20 seconds

1333
01:13:58,620 --> 01:14:02,620
It's so fast

1334
01:14:02,620 --> 01:14:04,620
Everyone worked hard

1335
01:14:04,620 --> 01:14:07,620
Let's count down together

1336
01:14:07,620 --> 01:14:15,620
8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1

1337
01:14:15,620 --> 01:14:25,620
We did it

1338
01:14:25,620 --> 01:14:35,620
We did it together

1339
01:14:35,620 --> 01:14:37,620
We did it together

1340
01:14:37,620 --> 01:14:41,620
Everyone worked hard

1341
01:14:41,620 --> 01:14:45,620
I said it like a joke

1342
01:14:45,620 --> 01:15:11,620
I think anyone who can stand this can stand anything

1343
01:15:11,620 --> 01:15:17,620
I think anyone can stand this

1344
01:15:17,620 --> 01:15:22,620
I can't do it

1345
01:15:22,620 --> 01:15:25,620
Everyone worked hard

1346
01:15:25,620 --> 01:15:29,620
Everyone worked hard

1347
01:15:29,620 --> 01:15:34,620
I said it like a joke

1348
01:15:34,620 --> 01:15:38,620
I said it like a joke

1349
01:15:38,620 --> 01:15:50,120
More than farewell, more than sadness, the longing is strong

1350
01:15:50,120 --> 01:16:01,620
A journey of loneliness and a single breath of back to back

1351
01:16:01,620 --> 01:16:12,620
At the window of the train that started to move

1352
01:16:12,620 --> 01:16:24,620
I just watched the scenery flowing

1353
01:16:24,620 --> 01:16:35,620
The sky of the cherry blossom tree that bloomed

1354
01:16:35,620 --> 01:17:02,120
It was so blue that it was so sad that my heart trembled

1355
01:17:02,120 --> 01:17:08,120
If we are separated, we will be separated

1356
01:17:08,120 --> 01:17:16,120
This feeling that grows even more

1357
01:17:16,120 --> 01:17:25,120
I can't forget the night when I opened my eyes

1358
01:17:25,120 --> 01:17:33,120
Wrapped in the mother and father of the day

1359
01:17:33,120 --> 01:17:47,620
If you trace the life of the soft days that have passed, you will live

1360
01:17:47,620 --> 01:17:58,620
To the sky of the cherry blossom tree that bloomed

1361
01:17:58,620 --> 01:18:05,120
Someday I will come back, someday I will come back

1362
01:18:05,120 --> 01:18:26,120
I will definitely come back

1363
01:18:35,120 --> 01:18:41,120
Thank you!

1364
01:18:41,120 --> 01:18:48,120
Thank you!

1365
01:18:48,120 --> 01:18:51,120
Don't forget to dance!

1366
01:18:51,120 --> 01:19:06,120
Thank you!
