1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Please look forward to it.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Please look forward to it.

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
We're going to have a punishment game.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Kouhaku, who's going to win?

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
This is strange, isn't it?

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I'm going to get angry at Osaka.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
There's no such word.

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Who's going to win?

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Who wrote this?

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I don't know. Raise your hand.

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
It looks like Mr. Tamao.

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
What?

13
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Idiot.

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Idiot.

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
This is the 42nd NHK Kouhaku Song Contest.

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
We have all the participants.

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm writing it down.

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
There are a lot of first-time participants.

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Who are they?

20
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I heard about them a while ago.

21
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I heard about them a while ago.

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Who is Smokey Mountain?

23
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I don't know him at all.

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
There's something strange in the red.

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Who is it?

26
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Who is Sarah Brightman?

27
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Who knows Sarah Brightman?

28
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I don't know.

29
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Who is Sarah Brightman?

30
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I don't know.

31
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Who is Sarah Brightman?

32
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I don't know.

33
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Who is Sarah Brightman?

34
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I don't know.

35
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
The song is Love is Over.

36
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Why now?

37
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
This became a topic.

38
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
What song is this?

39
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,500
What song is this?

40
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:36,500
What song is this?

41
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:39,000
Iruzuku Machikado.

42
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
The town's colouring.

43
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
That's it.

44
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Who is Sawada Chikako?

45
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Let's go to the sea of this year.

46
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
This guy is not going to wake up, is he?

47
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I don't know if he's going to wake up on the same day.

48
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
He's going to!

49
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
You idiot!

50
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
If you're this old, you should have gone to bed early.

51
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
You should have gone to bed the day before.

52
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Is that so?

53
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Of course.

54
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I've been watching this for a long time.

55
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
There's no basis for this.

56
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
There's no basis for this.

57
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
But as a winner,

58
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I think the white one is a bit more advantageous.

59
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
But the order is not clear yet.

60
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
That's true.

61
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
So it's very hard to predict.

62
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
It's lined up in that order.

63
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
That's right.

64
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
So it's not a big deal who's going to win the first round.

65
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
That's true.

66
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
If you can do this, I want you to set it up for me.

67
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
If you can do this, I want you to set it up for me.

68
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
The order.

69
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
The order.

70
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
If I were to set it up,

71
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I'd have to grab the first round.

72
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
That's right.

73
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Smokey Mountain.

74
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Why?

75
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I don't know.

76
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I'm going to say it's a big deal.

77
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
The big bird is Andy.

78
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I don't know why, so I'll just say it's hard.

79
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I think it's red.

80
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Red.

81
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I think this is the problem.

82
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
The red group.

83
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Wada Akiko.

84
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
You did the 6th round, right?

85
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I didn't know if I could get out.

86
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I think Akiko will cry after he's won.

87
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
He said he would.

88
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I did it this far, and I wanted to go, but I can't sing.

89
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I'm going to cry.

90
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
And then everyone will cry.

91
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I'm going to cry.

92
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I don't know about that.

93
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I'm going to cry.

94
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I have a brother.

95
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I have a brother.

96
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Jin, Jin, Jin.

97
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Yes.

98
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I have a brother.

99
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I see.

100
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Wada Akiko comes out when he's going to cry, and when he says,

101
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Jin, Jin, Jin, it's going to make everyone cry.

102
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,000
That's true.

103
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I've seen it many times.

104
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
You're red.

105
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Red.

106
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
You got it right.

107
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I got it right.

108
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
There was no problem at all.

109
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Yes, yes, yes.

110
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I got it.

111
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Now, what are we going to do if we lose?

112
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
It's a penalty game.

113
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
It's a penalty game.

114
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
It's been a while.

115
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I can't decide.

116
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I've been thinking about a lot of things.

117
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
We've decided.

118
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
We've decided.

119
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Let's get rid of the other programs.

120
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
That's how it started.

121
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
One more thing.

122
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Bad reaction.

123
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Bad reaction.

124
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I've been thinking about a lot of things.

125
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Color bar.

126
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Yes.

127
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Challenge the color bar.

128
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Yes.

129
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
What time does the TV show end on Sunday?

130
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
It ends at half past two.

131
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
It ends at half past two.

132
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
And the next reunion is probably about five o'clock.

133
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
About five o'clock.

134
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
About five o'clock?

135
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Yes.

136
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
In the meantime, we have two and a half hours.

137
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
That's right.

138
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
In the meantime, part of it, about five minutes.

139
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Whichever way you bend it, it turns into a color bar.

140
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Beep.

141
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
We're still negotiating.

142
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
We haven't gotten permission yet.

143
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
We don't know yet.

144
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
If it doesn't work, the TV show will end on Sunday.

145
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Then, in the picture.

146
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
A pigeon will come out.

147
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
A pigeon will come out.

148
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Let's run away.

149
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Let's run away.

150
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Whichever way you bend it, it turns into a color bar.

151
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
It's early in the morning, though.

152
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Yes.

153
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
What time does it end?

154
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
What time does it end?

155
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
About four o'clock.

156
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
About four o'clock.

157
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
In the world of three o'clock or four o'clock.

158
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
If I lose, what will you do?

159
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I'm fine.

160
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Don't come.

161
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
You're coming home again?

162
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Of course not.

163
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
That's right.

164
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I'll go even if you lose.

165
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Absolutely not.

166
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
That's not possible.

167
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I think that's what the show is about.

168
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
What kind of punishment game is that?

169
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
One hand in the same place.

170
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Why are you crying?

171
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Ladies and gentlemen.

172
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
It's different from usual, isn't it?

173
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Well, it's the first time I've done something like this in a proper studio.

174
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
It's the first time.

175
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
It's disgusting.

176
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
It's disgusting, isn't it?

177
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Let's go home early.

178
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
It's too far.

179
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
The other day.

180
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Yes.

181
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
The other day.

182
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
What are you doing?

183
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I'm not being looked down on as a character.

184
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I'm being looked down on a little by little.

185
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
You know, I feel like a woman.

186
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
What are you talking about?

187
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I feel warm.

188
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Idiot!

189
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I'm being looked down on.

190
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
You're like a murderer.

191
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
What are you talking about?

192
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I went into a convenience store.

193
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
There was a middle school girl.

194
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
She was wearing a hat.

195
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I didn't know what she was wearing.

196
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
There was a girl in her first or second year of junior high school.

197
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
She was looking at me.

198
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I thought she was looking down on me.

199
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
She was looking down on you.

200
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
She was looking for you.

201
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
She was touching my skin and leaving me.

202
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
She was looking at me.

203
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I thought she was looking down on me.

204
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I was wondering what would happen next.

205
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
She took off my hat.

206
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
She took off my hat and hit me on the head.

207
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
You're a weakling.

208
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I'm a weakling.

209
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
She hit me on the head.

210
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I couldn't take it anymore.

211
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I couldn't take it anymore.

212
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
She was a girl.

213
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I couldn't get angry at her.

214
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
She came to me.

215
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
She took off my hat.

216
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I went home.

217
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I was in a taxi.

218
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I thought I couldn't get angry at her.

219
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I thought so.

220
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I thought so.

221
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Hamada is amazing.

222
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Why?

223
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,000
You don't have to go fast.

224
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
What are you doing?

225
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
It's hot.

226
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Wait a minute.

227
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
She was laughing at me.

228
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I was wondering what would happen to Hamada.

229
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Nitta, me and the taxi driver were thinking about it.

230
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
You're a liar.

231
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
The driver has nothing to do with it.

232
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
She is amazing.

233
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
It's your specialty.

234
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
What kind of actress is she?

235
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
For example,

236
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Hamada, I'm always watching you.

237
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
It's not like that.

238
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I'm a weakling.

239
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
A weakling?

240
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I'm a weakling.

241
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
What kind of situation is this?

242
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I'm a weakling and a weakling.

243
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I'm a big fan of yours.

244
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Really?

245
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
If you say so, it's okay.

246
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
It's okay.

247
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
It's okay.

248
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Hey, motor!

249
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Don't play with me!

250
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I'll be angry.

251
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Hamada came to me.

252
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
She said,

253
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Hamada, let's go.

254
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I said,

255
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Ha ha ha ha.

256
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Come here.

257
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
It's hard to talk.

258
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
It's okay to talk.

259
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
But if you are beaten up,

260
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Normally, when humans come to us,

261
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
we don't get angry immediately.

262
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
If we don't get angry on the spot,

263
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
we go home, calm down,

264
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
think about it,

265
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
and get angry.

266
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
That's true.

267
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
You're a little different.

268
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
In that sense, you're just a foreigner.

269
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Why?

270
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I'm you.

271
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I'm not a big fan of you,

272
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
but I hate you very much.

273
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I said too much.

274
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I'm sorry.

275
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
You're a little different.

276
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
In that sense, you're just a foreigner.

277
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I'm sure.

278
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I'm sure.

279
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I met you in Osaka a long time ago.

280
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
You had a fight with a taxi driver.

281
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I stopped you at first.

282
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

283
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I was angry.

284
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I'm sure.

285
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
What?

286
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I'm still angry.

287
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I'm sure.

288
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
It was nine years ago.

289
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
What?

290
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
When I was still living in Osaka,

291
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I was treated like a child.

292
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

293
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
That's right.

294
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I asked you to get in the taxi.

295
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I went to the station.

296
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I thought it was bad because it was a one-meter distance,

297
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
but I asked you to do it.

298
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
What?

299
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Can I get on the bus from there?

300
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I came here.

301
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
After the customer left, the customer came out,

302
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
so I can't get on the bus with him.

303
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
That's not cool.

304
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I said I'm sorry.

305
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Get on the bus.

306
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I'm sure.

307
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Are you angry?

308
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Why are you angry?

309
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Why are you angry?

310
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Then you got on the bus.

311
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
You came to stop the bus, right?

312
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Yes, yes, yes.

313
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
You came to stop the bus.

314
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Stop the bus.

315
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Stop the bus.

316
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I asked you what you meant by getting on the bus.

317
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Why are you angry?

318
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
The two of us were angry.

319
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
But when you're angry,

320
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
you feel scared.

321
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
What?

322
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
You look like a child,

323
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
but you're really strong.

324
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
That's not true.

325
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
That's right.

326
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
That's not true.

327
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
It doesn't matter.

328
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
You're a scaredy-cat.

329
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
You're still a kid.

330
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
You were on the JR train from Osaka Station.

331
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Give me a hand.

332
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I know that.

333
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I know that.

334
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
What are you talking about?

335
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
You can't do that.

336
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I said, let me do it.

337
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,000
We were in the middle of the train.

338
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I said, let's get off at the next station.

339
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
He ran away at the next station.

340
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
No, you got off.

341
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Don't say that.

342
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
You ran away, didn't you?

343
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
You're mistaken.

344
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
You ran away, didn't you?

345
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
You ran away, didn't you?

346
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
You ran away, didn't you?

347
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
You ran away, didn't you?

348
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I got off and hit here.

349
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Don't say that.

350
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I don't care about your life, Hamada.

351
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
What are you talking about?

352
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I'm going to get killed.

353
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Are you serious?

354
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I'm going to get killed.

355
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I'm serious.

356
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Do you know what happened yesterday?

357
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
There was an announcement.

358
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
The wife of the vice-principal said,

359
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:18,000
When was the last time you kissed?

360
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I'm going to get killed.

361
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
You're going to get killed.

362
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I don't care.

363
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
There were complaints from the Iranians.

364
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
What?

365
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
They were like this.

366
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
They were like this.

367
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
They were like this.

368
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
What are you talking about?

369
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
The Iranians?

370
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Yes!

371
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
They were watching TV like that.

372
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Is that so?

373
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
If I say that here, my wife will call me.

374
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Well, it was not before that.

375
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:56,000
My dick is so small that I can cut it.

376
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
There's no way you can make a mosaic like this.

377
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:04,000
My dick is so long and wide.

378
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Stop it!

379
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Setagaya-kun, Nakayama-kun, good evening.

380
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I have a question for you.

381
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Bun-yo-yo-yo-yo-yon, Bin-yo-yo-yo-yo-yon, Bun-yo-yo-yo-yo-yon.

382
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Which one do you think is the most pleasant?

383
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Bin-yo-yo-yo-yon.

384
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:36,000
It doesn't look interesting at all.

385
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
You're still not satisfied.

386
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Which one is the most interesting out of these three?

387
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Which one is interesting?

388
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Bun-yo-yo-yo-yo-yon.

389
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
You're still not satisfied.

390
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I can't make a mosaic like this.

391
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Bun-yo-yo-yo-yon.

392
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Bun-yo-yo-yo-yon.

393
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
It doesn't look interesting at all.

394
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Bin-yo-yo-yo-yon.

395
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Do you want to try this?

396
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Bin-yo-yo-yo-yon.

397
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
It doesn't look interesting at all.

398
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Bun-yo-yo-yo-yon, Bun-yo-yo-yo-yon.

399
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
You're still not satisfied.

400
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Which one is the most interesting out of these three?

401
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
It doesn't look interesting at all.

402
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
It doesn't look interesting at all.

403
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Bun-yo-yo-yo-yon.

404
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
It doesn't look interesting at all.

405
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Bun-yo-yo-yo-yon.

406
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
It doesn't look interesting at all.

407
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Bun-yo-yo-yo-yon, Bun-yo-yo-yo-yon.

408
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
It doesn't look interesting at all.

409
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Bun-yo-yo-yo-yon, Bun-yo-yo-yo-yon.

410
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:16,000
It doesn't look interesting at all.

411
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
She's a bit...

412
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,800
Hey!

413
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,800
You there!

414
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,800
What was that?

415
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,800
I just had a sensei like that.

416
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,800
Oh, you did?

417
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,800
She's like...

418
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,800
She's like a hated...

419
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,800
Like a pig.

420
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,800
If she's like that,

421
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,800
everyone will hate her.

422
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,800
I'm sorry for this guy.

423
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,800
His parents will hate him too.

424
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,800
Everything will be over.

425
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,800
It'll be hot.

426
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,800
First of all,

427
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,800
it's best to

428
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,800
make her look like a pig.

429
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,800
That's the best.

430
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,800
Right?

431
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,800
It's too much to make her look like a pig.

432
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,800
I think it's best to make her look like a different person.

433
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,800
I see.

434
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,800
Like changing her hobbies.

435
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,800
Don't show off.

436
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,800
Let's make her look like a different person.

437
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,800
Let's decide the time and place for the date.

438
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,800
We can go to Shibuya or Hachiko-mae.

439
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,800
Let's go to a place like that.

440
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,800
Before everyone is watching.

441
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,800
Don't dress like that.

442
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,800
It'll be embarrassing if you're with her.

443
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,800
If you're with her,

444
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,800
you'll be embarrassed.

445
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,800
That's the best.

446
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,800
What do you think is best?

447
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,800
First of all,

448
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,800
she's like...

449
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,800
She's like...

450
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,800
She's like a woman.

451
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,800
You're overreacting.

452
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,800
Why?

453
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,800
It's strange.

454
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,800
She has a big body.

455
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,800
She has a big sword.

456
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,800
She has a big shield.

457
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,800
She has a big chest.

458
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,800
She has a big chest.

459
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,800
First of all,

460
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,800
she has high heels.

461
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,800
She looks like a woman.

462
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,800
She looks like a woman.

463
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,800
She's like a woman.

464
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,800
If she's with you,

465
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,800
you'll probably never see her again.

466
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,800
Definitely.

467
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,800
You should say that.

468
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,800
I don't know if it's right to say she's lame.

469
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,800
I don't know if it's right to say she's lame.

470
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,800
Right?

471
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,800
Cut.

472
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,800
Cut.

473
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,800
Cut.

474
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,800
When does this happen?

475
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,800
Doesn't it happen when you do something bad?

476
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,800
Doesn't it happen when you do something bad?

477
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,800
When a little child...

478
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,800
What?

479
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,800
When a child does something bad.

480
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,800
When a child does something bad.

481
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,800
Didn't you use it?

482
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,800
Don't ask me that.

483
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,800
Don't ask me that.

484
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,800
Don't you know?

485
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,800
I know.

486
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,800
How do you usually use it?

487
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,800
I don't usually use it.

488
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,800
I don't usually use it.

489
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,800
Why do you use it in the New Year's party?

490
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,800
When it's all excited,

491
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,800
it's about time

492
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,800
to have a Takeda-kun

493
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,800
do a Tsumuten-ten.

494
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,800
to have a Takeda-kun do a Tsumuten-ten.

495
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,800
Look, this year

496
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,800
there is a child called Ohirachi.

497
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,800
You called Takeda-kun.

498
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,800
So go ahead.

499
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,800
I don't want to see that.

500
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,800
You don't want to make fun of me again, do you?

501
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,800
No, no, no.

502
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,800
I don't know.

503
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,800
I don't know how to do a Tsumuten-ten in the New Year's party.

504
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,800
You've seen it before, haven't you?

505
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,800
No, I haven't heard of it.

506
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,800
Just try it.

507
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,800
Is this how you do a Tsumuten-ten?

508
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,800
It's not funny at all.

509
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,800
I don't know how to do it.

510
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,800
When you said you'd do a Tsumuten-ten

511
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,800
in the New Year's party,

512
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,800
I couldn't see your stupidity.

513
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,800
You couldn't see it?

514
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,800
Can't you see my stupidity even if I'm doing a Tsumuten-ten in the New Year's party?

515
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,800
So do it.

516
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,800
What are you going to do with a Tsumuten-ten?

517
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,800
I can't make a stupidity that you can't see.

518
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,800
Cut this letter.

519
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,800
Look,

520
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,800
it's going to be a long talk.

521
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,800
This is it.

522
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,800
This is going to spread.

523
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,800
When I was in kindergarten,

524
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,800
I was playing in the playground

525
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,800
and I fell from my head

526
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,800
when I got on the car's hood.

527
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,800
At that time,

528
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,800
there was a dog poop and I was saved.

529
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,800
My friend saw me with dog poop on my head

530
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,800
and I ran away.

531
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,800
When I went home crying,

532
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,800
my grandmother put water on my organs and wiped it for me.

533
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,800
It's a long story.

534
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,800
Before I go to this school,

535
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,800
I want to make a complaint.

536
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,800
Yesterday, you said,

537
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,800
Oh, this guy is stepping on dog poop.

538
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,800
Who is the dog?

539
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,800
I decided.

540
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,800
In that area,

541
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,800
there are only dogs and cats.

542
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,800
Is that so?

543
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,800
What is there?

544
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,800
Who is doing it on the street?

545
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,800
There are also insects.

546
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,800
You know dog poop.

547
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,800
If you do dog poop,

548
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,800
I don't know.

549
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,800
If you look at the dog poop,

550
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,800
it's all mine.

551
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,800
But you don't poop that big.

552
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,800
I don't know.

553
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,800
What kind of insect?

554
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,800
Do you poop bigger than your body?

555
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,800
I don't know.

556
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,800
Where were these small insects?

557
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,800
There are a lot of insects.

558
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,800
They all come together

559
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,800
and get together.

560
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,800
I don't know.

561
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,800
The small insects are

562
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,800
the same as the big insects.

563
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,800
What kind of man are you?

564
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,800
Are you human?

565
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,800
You poop on the street.

566
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,800
I don't know if there are such insects.

567
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,800
I don't know if you are a dog.

568
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,800
You are a dog.

569
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,800
It's a dog poop that fell

570
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,800
from the car bonnet.

571
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,800
You poop in such a place.

572
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,800
I don't know if you are a woman.

573
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,800
I don't know if you are a woman.

574
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,800
I don't know if you are a woman.

575
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,800
I don't know if you are a woman.

576
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,800
You can't be a woman.

577
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,800
I said that to you

578
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,800
to check who is a man

579
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,800
You can't be a woman.

580
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,800
There are many animals that poop.

581
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,800
There are a tiger, a hyena, a rhino, a elephant, a giraffe...

582
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,800
There are many animals.

583
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,800
That's not true.

584
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,800
There are no animals in the park.

585
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,800
Why?

586
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,800
Why?

587
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,800
There are no animals in the park.

588
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,800
I don't know.

589
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,800
I don't know.

590
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,300
No, I didn't.

591
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:49,800
I'm coming.

592
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,800
No, I didn't.

593
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,800
I've seen it before.

594
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:54,800
It started again.

595
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:03,800
So, please don't decide with dog poop.

596
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:06,300
I want to talk about that first.

597
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:07,800
Well, it's dog poop, but...

598
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,800
What? That's what you're thinking?

599
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:10,800
That...

600
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:11,800
I've never said,

601
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:12,800
I've never said,

602
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,800
I've never said,

603
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:14,800
I've never said,

604
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:17,300
I've never said I've never Θve to say it.

605
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:18,300
I've never said I'll never show my feelings.

606
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:20,300
He said it's too cold.

607
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:21,300
So I said,

608
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:23,300
You're too cold.

609
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:28,200
And he

610
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:28,800
That was nothing.

611
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:29,800
I had nothing.

612
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:30,800
That was nothing.

613
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:31,300
I had nothing.

614
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:31,800
I had nothing.

615
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,800
He really is short of information.

616
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:34,800
The carrier is covered with skin.

617
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:35,800
I was with the carrier.

618
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:36,800
I had nothing.

619
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,800
I had nothing at all.

620
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:38,300
I had nothing at all.

621
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:38,800
I had nothing.

622
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:39,300
I had nothing.

623
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:42,000
Dude,

624
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,300
If you don't don't don't

625
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:44,300
Don't don't don't don't don't don't don't don't don't don't don't don't don't don't don't don't don't
