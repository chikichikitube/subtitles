00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Happy New Year

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I'm Fujiwara from Yoshimoto Kogyo

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
You guys are on TV

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
This program is brought to you by these sponsors

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
This week's show is a special program for kids

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Fujiwara chose the best VTR of the year

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
You did it

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
How was it?

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Looking back on last year

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
There are a lot of things that left an impression on me

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
You can do anything

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
It's all about having fun

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Well

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Well

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
From 10th to 7th

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Let's take a look

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Are you ready?

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Mizuno

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:27,000
It started from here

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
It started from here

21
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
It's fun

22
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Let's see how it goes

23
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I don't know

24
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I don't know

25
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Let's start with Tanaka

26
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Please

27
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
A B-class talent like you

28
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
And a C-class copywriter

29
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I don't know what I can do

30
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Everyone do your best

31
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
The talent competition started with Tanaka's strong greeting

32
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
The participants are riding the black bus

33
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
And the results

34
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
First, Okuda Tamiyo

35
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Yes

36
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Next is Hamada

37
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
If he passes Okuda, he will be the first winner

38
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
First winner

39
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
It's almost the same

40
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
3, 2, 1

41
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
3, 2, 1

42
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Okuda Tamiyo

43
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
What are you doing?

44
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
You idiot

45
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Why are you doing this?

46
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Congratulations

47
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,000
We have been loving each other

48
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:05,000
We have been watching it

49
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Let's be happy

50
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Who is that?

51
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Let's be together forever

52
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Thank you for the speech

53
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
That's what the host said

54
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I see

55
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
We watched it until the 7th place

56
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
It was the first original

57
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:41,000
It's getting more and more weird

58
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,000
You don't plan to do it again this year, right?

59
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
No

60
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I don't want to do it again

61
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I want to see it

62
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I want to see it

63
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
It's going to be boring

64
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
It's not a brief

65
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
It's not a brief

66
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
It's interesting

67
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
It's called Hishire Yume no Naka

68
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
It's cool

69
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
It's beautiful

70
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Let's go

71
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Drin

72
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Drin

73
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Drin

74
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Drin

75
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Drin

76
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Drin

77
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Drin

78
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Drin

79
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I'm sorry

80
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
It's good

81
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
It's good

82
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
It's good

83
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
End

84
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
It's funny

85
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Something is going to be born

86
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Yamazaki can't lose

87
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
That's right

88
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I'll take it off

89
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Take it off slowly

90
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
It's slow

91
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
It's slow

92
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Drin

93
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Drin

94
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Drin

95
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Drin

96
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Drin

97
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Yamazaki and Endo, good luck

98
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Next

99
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
9th

100
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
It's cold

101
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I want you to do your best

102
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I'm sorry

103
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
It's hard

104
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:55,000
The calendar of 1999 is made up of various punishment games

105
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
First of all, Matsumoto born in September

106
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Start

107
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I'll do my best

108
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
You have to do it well

109
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I see

110
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I'm the leader

111
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Next, Hamada born in May

112
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Gorilla

113
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Gorilla

114
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Gorilla

115
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Gorilla

116
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Gorilla

117
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Gorilla

118
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Gorilla

119
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Gorilla

120
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:03,000
And the director Saito born in November

121
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
It wasn't fun when I was doing it

122
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I don't know how to do it

123
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
1 million yen win

124
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I want to get 1 million yen

125
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
1 million yen

126
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
What is it?

127
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Did you hit something?

128
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
The UFO has fallen over there

129
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
It seems to be recording

130
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Really?

131
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Endo?

132
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Really?

133
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Hey

134
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
You are great

135
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
You are an alien

136
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Take the alien back to the dressing room

137
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Start the human experiment

138
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Endo

139
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
What is it?

140
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
What is it?

141
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:44,000
What is it?

142
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I'm glad

143
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I'm going home

144
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Bye

145
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Can I say something?

146
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Yes

147
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Idiot

148
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I found out that the famous director of the program is a fool

149
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
It even developed into a trial in the program

150
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Endo

151
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I was in Yoshinoya

152
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
It was when I was shooting in Yoshinoya

153
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I remember this

154
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
After the shooting

155
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:46,000
The producer who got beef bowl from the store

156
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Hey you guys

157
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I got beef bowl

158
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Share it with everyone

159
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Yay

160
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Onuma, who was watching the scene, caught Eddie

161
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Hey

162
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
What did you get earlier?

163
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
It's Tadaken from Yoshinoya

164
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Give it to me

165
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Give it to me

166
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Somehow

167
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I took that Tadaken from Eddie

168
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
That night

169
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Give it to me

170
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
We're eating out today, hurry up

171
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Really?

172
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Yay

173
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
It's been a long time since they've eaten out

174
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
The wife who takes care of them

175
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
The destination they arrived at

176
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Yoshinoya

177
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
And of course the payment

178
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Please use this Tadaken

179
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
How many tickets do you have?

180
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I have all the tickets I got

181
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
All of them?

182
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
That's a lot

183
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
That's a lot

184
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
The woman also got it

185
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
What?

186
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
That's a lot

187
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
How many tickets did you get?

188
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
50,000 yen

189
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
What a scary man

190
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
There was a great reaction

191
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
There's no director like that

192
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I've never been hit by Onuma

193
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Yes

194
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Please move

195
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Tadaken from Yoshinoya

196
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
They're all dressed up

197
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
If they lose the game

198
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
They'll be left behind in the city

199
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,000
This is Senda, Mitsuo, Nana

200
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Both sides are Nana

201
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Here we go

202
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Senda, Mitsuo, Nana

203
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I don't know

204
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
It's different

205
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
It's one point

206
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Senda, Mitsuo, Nana

207
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I'm so mad

208
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I'm so mad

209
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Senda, Mitsuo, Nana

210
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
What's that?

211
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I'm still thinking about it

212
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
If you fail

213
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I'll be in trouble

214
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
One point for both

215
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Here we go

216
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
From Sura

217
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Mitsuo, Nana, Senda

218
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Mitsuo, Nana, Senda

219
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Mitsuo, Nana, Senda

220
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Mitsuo, Nana

221
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
If you're strong, you'll get a lot of pressure

222
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
After all, the loser Matsumoto gets off the bus

223
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
And goes to buy crepes

224
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
So cool

225
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I'm so embarrassed

226
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
You're going too far

227
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
We're going too far

228
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
The winner of the game is a luxury product

229
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Even if you lose, you'll get a nice gift from Akko

230
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,000
It's a 30th anniversary of Wada Aki's life

231
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
It's a punishment game, right?

232
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
It's not a punishment game

233
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Why are we doing a 30th anniversary of Wada Aki's punishment game?

234
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
First is the black beard battle

235
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:04,000
The loser gets a kiss mark on his neck

236
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Ready, start

237
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,000
The loser gets a kiss mark on his neck

238
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Akko, here you go

239
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
The loser gets a kiss mark on his neck

240
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
The loser gets a kiss mark on his neck

241
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,000
The loser gets a kiss mark on his neck

242
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Don't use standard language

243
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Come on

244
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
What is this 30th anniversary celebration?

245
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Come to my house

246
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I'll be done soon, so come

247
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Be quiet

248
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,000
He's sitting down

249
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,000
It was amazing

250
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
He's really sitting down

251
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,000
It was amazing

252
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Something's coming out

253
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,000
What are you doing?

254
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Why are you going back?

255
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I'm going home

256
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
If you draw the same picture as Yama-chan, you win

257
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,000
If you lose, you get a deep kiss with Akko

258
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Here's the answer

259
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
The king

260
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Let's start with Matsumoto

261
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
But it looks like the king

262
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I'll decide after looking at Amano-san

263
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
The winner gets a deep kiss

264
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Akko, here you go

265
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
The loser gets a deep kiss mark on his neck

266
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
The loser gets a deep kiss mark on his neck

267
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
It's a deep kiss

268
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I want you

269
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I want you

270
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I want you

271
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Stop

272
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
What are you doing?

273
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
What are you doing?

274
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I want you

275
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I want you

276
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I want you

277
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,000
That was amazing

278
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
That was amazing

279
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I was serious

280
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
That was amazing

281
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,000
How many days did you spend in your room?

282
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
That's right

283
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I heard it

284
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I want to do cosplay again

285
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,000
It's frustrating

286
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
There are still two more

287
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I want to see it in the toilet

288
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
That was interesting

289
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I went to the toilet the worst one last year

290
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I went to the toilet the worst one last year

291
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I couldn't move

292
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I couldn't move

293
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
The winner is in here

294
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
He hasn't come out yet

295
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Who is the winner?

296
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Who is the winner?

297
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Please watch the video

298
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,000
This is the punishment game

299
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,000
It's the same as the previous game

300
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,000
It's the same as the previous game

301
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Hamada's first shot is a nice shot

302
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,000
But the rules are heavy

303
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Matsumoto's team wins

304
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Hey

305
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Matsumoto's nice shot

306
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Matsumoto's team wins

307
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Matsumoto's team wins

308
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Hamada's punishment game

309
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Hamada's punishment game

310
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,000
And the punishment game

311
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Hamada, I want to see the Titanic

312
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,000
The Titanic?

313
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,000
The love scene was nice

314
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
What?

315
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
The love scene

316
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Why?

317
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Go to Hollywood with your mother and shoot the Titanic

318
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Hamada's punishment game

319
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Go to Hollywood with your mother and shoot the Titanic

320
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Hamada takes his mother to Los Angeles

321
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Hamada takes his mother to Los Angeles

322
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Hamada takes his mother to Los Angeles

323
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,000
I want to go home

324
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,000
And this is the result

325
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Close your eyes

326
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Close your eyes

327
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I saw the video and I remembered again

328
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
I believe you

329
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
It's Daikon

330
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I don't like this image

331
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Open your eyes

332
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I'm flying

333
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,000
I'm flying

334
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I'm flying

335
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,000
I don't like this

336
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,000
I don't know how to look at this

337
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,000
I'm a monster

338
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,000
I'm Kazuo Umezu

339
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:27,000
I don't like this

340
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,000
I don't like this

341
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,000
I don't like this

342
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,000
I don't want to see this

343
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I don't know how to look at this

344
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,000
I don't know how to look at this

345
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,000
I don't know how to look at this

346
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Hamada kisses a lot

347
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,000
I kissed Tanaka

348
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Tanaka's lips are soft

349
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:15,000
It's softer than any woman I've kissed

350
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:19,000
I'm serious

351
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,000
This is the first

352
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:27,000
This is the first

353
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,000
1998

354
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,000
I'm excited

355
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,000
I looked back

356
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Let's do our best

357
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Let's do our best

358
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Let's do our best

359
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Let's do our best

360
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Thank you

361
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:14,000
This program was brought to you by these sponsors
