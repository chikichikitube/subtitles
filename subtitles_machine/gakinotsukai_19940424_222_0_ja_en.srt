1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I've been waiting for this day for a long time.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I change my hair every day.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Please show me.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
If you look down, you can see my hair.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Please show me.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
This is not something to play with.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I'll do it.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I'll do it.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
First of all, kiss on the cheek.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
It's light.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
This is 5 points.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Don't you hit the cheek?

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
It's a kiss.

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
If you shake hands.

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Is that okay?

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
1 point.

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Thank you.

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
If you say hello, 10,000 points.

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Thank you very much.

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
That's too much.

21
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
30 points for putting your nose in.

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
50 points.

23
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
There's something like this.

24
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
This is his weapon.

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
This is about 50,000 points.

26
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
If you put this here.

27
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
50,000 points.

28
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
50,000 points.

29
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
If you grab it, 50 points.

30
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I see.

31
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
If you do this.

32
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
It hurts.

33
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Who benefits from that?

34
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
100 points.

35
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
100 points.

36
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
What happens if you take a picture?

37
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Let's take a picture of that, too.

38
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
How many points do you get?

39
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
If you take a picture of that, you win.

40
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
If you take a picture of that, you win.

41
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
If you take a picture of that, you win.

42
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
This program is provided by the sponsor you are watching.

43
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I'm tired.

44
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I'll dance.

45
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Let's go.

46
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Let's go.

47
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
That's it.

48
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I set it up like this.

49
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
That's nice.

50
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
This time, alcohol, man, and life as a writer.

51
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I see.

52
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Let's call him right away.

53
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Yes.

54
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Mr. Kiyuki Nosaka.

55
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Nice to meet you.

56
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Nice to meet you.

57
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
It hurts.

58
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Nice to meet you.

59
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Nice to meet you.

60
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Nice to meet you.

61
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Nice to meet you.

62
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Which one is Matsumoto?

63
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I'm Matsumoto.

64
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
It may be bad to say it roughly, but it's really interesting.

65
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Is that so?

66
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
It's already in, isn't it?

67
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
It's in.

68
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
What is the best thing in the progress of science?

69
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I think it's a birth controller.

70
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
What's that?

71
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
In other words, you don't have to give birth to children, do you?

72
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Yes.

73
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
You don't have to give birth to children.

74
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:20,000
In other words, when you say something, it's just a joke.

75
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
What are you talking about?

76
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Please say it quickly.

77
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:33,000
When you say it roughly, it's a secret.

78
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I really don't know what you're talking about.

79
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
What's wrong with you?

80
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
What's wrong with you?

81
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
It's obvious that it hurts.

82
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
For example, if you want to get married at the age of 17, that's a great message.

83
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Why are you twisting your hand?

84
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I don't know how to put it in words.

85
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I don't know how to put it in words.

86
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Your hairstyle hasn't changed much.

87
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I don't know how to put it in words.

88
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
It's been like this all the time.

89
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
You're barefoot.

90
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
That's true.

91
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
If you loosen this, can you take it off?

92
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I can take it off.

93
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
In general, this is the upper class of Japan.

94
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

95
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
How much did it cost?

96
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
It was 180,000 yen.

97
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
No way.

98
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
180,000 yen?

99
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
It doesn't matter.

100
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I don't know how to put it in words.

101
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
You don't know how to put it in words.

102
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
In the old days, this hairstyle was all bald.

103
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Is that true?

104
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I don't know if I have a bald head.

105
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Everyone has a bald head.

106
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I always want to rub my father's hair.

107
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Everyone has a bald head.

108
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
What about you?

109
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I have a bald head.

110
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Have you ever played with a man when you were young?

111
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I've never done that.

112
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I'm an old man.

113
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
That's funny.

114
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Do you still have a woman in your 60s?

115
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
It's crazy.

116
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Are you crazy?

117
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Yes.

118
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Do you still have a woman in your 60s?

119
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I have a woman once every three days.

120
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Once every three days?

121
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I can masturbate.

122
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Do you still have a woman in your 60s?

123
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Do you still have a woman in your 60s?

124
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I used to masturbate a lot when I was a primary school student.

125
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Did you just fart?

126
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
You did your best today.

127
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I did my best today.

128
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I have a strange figure.

129
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
It hurts.

130
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
You were strong.

131
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
If it was a crab, it would have been removed.

132
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Let's see my score.

133
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
My score is...

134
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
1,088 out of 60,000.

135
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Let's see your score.

136
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Thank you very much.

137
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Let's see your score.

138
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Let's see your score.

139
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
1,759 out of 60,000.

140
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Why?

141
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
You did your best.

142
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I scored 50,000 points with a microphone.

143
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I see.

144
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Did you dig your shoes?

145
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I did.

146
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I scored 10,000 points.

147
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I have 60,000 points now.

148
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I have 60,000 points now.

149
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
What did I do?

150
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
You have a lot of points.

151
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
You have only one point.

152
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Don't you have a record?

153
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Let's record this next time.

154
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I may never do it again.

155
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
You're still fresh.

156
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
This is for summer.

157
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
That's good.

158
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Let's make it short.

159
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
It would be good if it was popular again.

160
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
You did it again.

161
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
It won't be popular anymore.

162
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
It won't be popular after three years.

163
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I'm sorry to say this to you.

164
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I'm sorry to say this to you.

165
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
What?

166
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I think you're very depressed.

167
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
What about me?

168
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
What?

169
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
You may die.

170
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I'm sorry.

171
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I want to throw up.

172
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
What do you mean?

173
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
You have a hole in your stomach, right?

174
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
What?

175
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
You want to throw up?

176
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I want to throw up.

177
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Don't do that.

178
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I want to throw up because I smoked too much two or three days ago.

179
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I know the cause.

180
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
You should quit smoking.

181
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Did I smoke too much?

182
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I don't know how many times I've been told.

183
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
What are you doing?

184
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
It happens sometimes.

185
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I don't want to live a long life.

186
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
How long do you want to live?

187
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
That's not true.

188
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
People think I'm crazy.

189
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I did everything I wanted to do.

190
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I ate a lot of caviar.

191
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
If you eat a lot of caviar, you can't do it.

192
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I ate a lot of foie gras.

193
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I don't care when I die.

194
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I don't want to die in pain or fear.

195
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:22,000
If I die in fear, I won't live until tomorrow at 2 o'clock.

196
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Why are you cutting off time?

197
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
It's okay.

198
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
That's good.

199
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
What are you doing?

200
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I don't know.

201
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
My lungs hurt.

202
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Do you go out with people?

203
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
What are you talking about?

204
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Have you ever been there?

205
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
No.

206
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I'm not loved by anyone.

207
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
You can't say that.

208
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I'm a loner.

209
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
It's okay.

210
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I'm scared.

211
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I used to be called a loner.

212
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I used to be called a loner.

213
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I was called a loner.

214
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I have a scar here.

215
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:11,000
If I say I'm a loner, people will think I'm a loner.

216
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
People think I'm a loner.

217
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I have a scar here.

218
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
People think I'm a loner.

219
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
It's a cancer.

220
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
It's clearly a cancer.

221
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
That's not true.

222
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
It's okay.

223
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
This doctor is not funny.

224
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I'm scared.

225
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Have you ever been to the hospital?

226
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I've never been to the hospital.

227
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I've never been to the hospital.

228
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I've never had a bone.

229
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I've never had a surgery.

230
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I had a surgery in Osaka.

231
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I have a scar in my throat.

232
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I had a surgery.

233
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
It's not here.

234
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
It's here, isn't it?

235
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
You've been doing this for a long time.

236
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
You've been doing this for a long time.

237
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
It's clearly here.

238
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I had a scar.

239
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Did you go to the hospital?

240
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I went to the hospital for a week.

241
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I want to go to the hospital for a week.

242
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Really?

243
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Do you know what a nurse is?

244
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I know.

245
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Don't say that.

246
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
You're an old man.

247
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Did I say that?

248
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
It's not popular in the world.

249
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
A nurse is strict.

250
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
You noticed it.

251
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I thought I was being strict.

252
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I thought it was okay.

253
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
You followed me well.

254
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
This is a fact.

255
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
A nurse is...

256
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
It's written in the textbook.

257
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:04,000
If there is a patient who is in a state where both hands are broken and cannot be used,

258
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,000
you have to do it by hand.

259
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
How did you know that?

260
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I've been aiming for it for a while.

261
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
You can't be a nurse.

262
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
That's impossible.

263
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
You can't do that.

264
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
That's not it.

265
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
That's the feeling of a personal nurse.

266
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
No.

267
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I don't like it.

268
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Why are you so desperate?

269
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
If you say you don't like it, it's no good.

270
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
That may be true.

271
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
There aren't many people who say that.

272
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,000
But if you can't use both hands, there are times when you get sick.

273
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
On the contrary, it may cause other diseases.

274
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
It may cause a disease.

275
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Only people who can't use both hands can do that.

276
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
That's right.

277
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
There aren't many people who can do that.

278
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
There aren't.

279
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
There aren't.

280
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,000
The way to do it is to do it by hand.

281
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
You can use it anywhere.

282
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
You can use it anywhere.

283
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I see.

284
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
But it's by hand.

285
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
What are you doing?

286
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
There are many ways to do it.

287
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
What?

288
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:30,000
You can do it with your hair.

289
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
What?

290
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
What?

291
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
In a commercial?

292
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Yes.

293
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
In a girl group?

294
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Yes.

295
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
What was it?

296
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
It's called something monkeys.

297
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Yes, yes, yes.

298
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Why are you singing?

299
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
You have a bad mood.

300
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I know.

301
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
What is it?

302
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Super monkeys.

303
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Yes, I know.

304
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
There is a guy who looks like a leader.

305
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
It's exactly a monkey.

306
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Do you want to sell that girl?

307
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
This is a question.

308
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Look at the commercial.

309
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
He's the only one on the screen.

310
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
The other members are dancing with him.

311
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
But he's the only one on the screen.

312
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
You can't see the other members.

313
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Yes.

314
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Do you know that?

315
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
The other members don't have families.

316
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Really?

317
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
You're not on the screen at all.

318
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I'm not on the screen.

319
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I think your mother is cuter than that guy.

320
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
This girl's mother says that.

321
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Yes, she says that.

322
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
But the screen is full of guys.

323
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Yes.

324
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
What does that mean?

325
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
But that's what a group is.

326
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
You just want to sell that girl, right?

327
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
That's not true.

328
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Hibagon will be on TV.

329
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Can you sell that Hibagon?

330
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Really.

331
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I saw the magazine the other day.

332
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Hibagon was laughing.

333
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
That's impossible.

334
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
But Hibagon is working hard.

335
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
There are no fans of Hibagon.

336
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Yes, there are.

337
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
There are.

338
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
There are.

339
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Are there fans of Hibagon?

340
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Yes, there are.

341
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Are there fans of Hibagon?

342
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Hibagon is here.

343
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Hibagon is here.

344
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Hibagon is here.

345
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
You're a fan of Ei-chan, right?

346
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Did you watch Ei-chan's drama?

347
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Yes, I did.

348
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
How was it as a fan of Ei-chan?

349
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
You're quite silent.

350
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
That's terrible.

351
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Are you just waiting for other people's opinions?

352
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Are you just waiting?

353
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
You were really Ei-chan.

354
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,000
You can't say, Yada-san, please do it again.

355
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Why is that?

356
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
You've been here a lot.

357
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
That's because Yada-san is a big fan.

358
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Yada-san, you can't say that now.

359
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
That's true.

360
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
That's true.

361
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
You can't do it.

362
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Please do it again.

363
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Why is that?

364
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Yada-san, you were silent just now.

365
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
You can't say, Yada-san, please do it again.

366
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Can I be silent?

367
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
You're silent.

368
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
You're silent.

369
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Ei-chan, you can be silent.

370
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
You've been in L.A. for a long time.

371
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
No, no, no, no.

372
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
That's because it's in English.

373
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
That's because it's in English?

374
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
That's because it's in English.

375
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I see.

376
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Let's watch her.

377
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
What?

378
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Let's watch her.

379
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
It must be hard.

380
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Open your eyes.

381
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I don't know.

382
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I don't know if she's changed at all since episode 2.

383
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I heard that Ei-chan is a different person.

384
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Really?

385
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
She's told to put a refrigerator in the dressing room.

386
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,000
She's told to put mineral water and Ghana chocolate in there.

387
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
That's what she's told to do?

388
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
That's what she's told to do?

389
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
She's told to put that in there.

390
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
If that's all she's told to do, she'll be able to work.

391
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,000
But the dressing room isn't Yaza's.

392
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
It's open for about three days.

393
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
On the day when it's open for three days from tomorrow,

394
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,000
she brings a bag from home and packs it up and goes home.

395
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Yaza does it herself?

396
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Yes, she does it herself.

397
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
She's so cool.

398
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Why do you have two holes in your nose?

399
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I don't think one of them is wrong.

400
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Please tell me why you have two holes in your nose.

401
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:12,000
If you have one hole in your nose, it's hard to breathe.

402
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
If you cut all of your nose hair,

403
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
you won't be able to breathe.

404
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
But if you do that, it'll be embarrassing.

405
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
If everyone does that, you won't be able to breathe.

406
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
If everyone does that.

407
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
But if you have one hole in your nose,

408
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:35,000
if it gets clogged, it'll be embarrassing.

409
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Right?

410
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
It'll be over, right?

411
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I'm wearing it as a sub.

412
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
But if you cut this part, it's big.

413
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
It's big.

414
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Does it ever get clogged?

415
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:52,000
It's big, but it makes my nose runny.

416
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
That's true.

417
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
It'll make your nose runny.

418
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
But it's big enough.

419
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I can take as much as I want.

420
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
That's your fault.

421
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
When you commit suicide,

422
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
you often put your shoes next to your clothes.

423
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Why do you take off your shoes when you commit suicide?

424
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Is it bad manners to commit suicide with your shoes on?

425
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
But that's true.

426
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
When you die,

427
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
you want to die, but you want them to find you soon after you die.

428
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
So you want them to find you soon,

429
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
so you put a message saying,

430
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I'm dead.

431
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,000
You don't know anything even if you put your arms around your body.

432
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
You don't know anything even if you put your arms around your body.

433
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
It's like an old man taking you home.

434
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
It's like an old man taking you home.

435
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Idiot.

436
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Are you stupid?

437
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
It doesn't matter if you're cheating on me.

438
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Do you think someone jumped off the bed when you were cheating on me?

439
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
I think so.

440
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I wonder if you're playing catch ball somewhere.

441
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Who plays catch ball on a rock?

442
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
If you're cheating on me,

443
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:14,000
if you look down, it's like a shark.

444
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,000
It's perfect.

445
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
But your shoes are the easiest to take off.

446
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
That's true.

447
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
I don't have a bra.

448
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
You're trying to take off your bra before you die.

449
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,000
I'm not the one who's going to fall.

450
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Hamada-san seems to be friends with Miho Nakayama.

451
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Do you know what Miho Nakayama's poop is?

452
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
You know what?

453
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
I don't know.

454
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
No, no, no.

455
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
You know what?

456
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Hamada-chan!

457
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Why do you want me to see that?

458
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Maybe you have something to say.

459
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
No, I don't.

460
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I saw your poop when I was in middle school.

461
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
You pooped in Sakanishi's house.

462
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
When I pooped and went home with Naga-san.

463
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
That's right.

464
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
You should have done that before you went home.

465
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
You were still there.

466
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
You might have wanted to go home with Naga-san,

467
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
but you were still there for about an hour.

468
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:36,000
That's why I pooped in front of you.

469
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
My pee is...

470
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
It's so soft.

471
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:55,000
It's the softest poop in the world.

472
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
I wonder what it is.

473
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:03,000
I think it was made by Okamoto Taro.

474
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I think Sakanishi had a hard time after that.

475
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:19,000
He had three family members.

476
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:25,000
This program was provided by the following sponsors.
