1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Natsumoto Shintoshi is seriously going to the White-Hatou-Rin again.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
In the afternoon of V-KIMA, the staff is once again summoned by the producer.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
You did it with the White-Hatou-Rin pants, didn't you?

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
At first, I was told that the sword wasn't a toy.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
You did it because you were frustrated, didn't you?

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Then, it looked like you were wearing a helmet.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
It was on January 2nd, wasn't it?

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Was it the second time you did it?

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
It was the second time.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
It was hard, wasn't it?

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I looked at it again.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I think the balance of the body is a little bad.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I see.

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
But...

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
That's right.

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
It's dangerous.

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
It's over.

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
That's right.

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
However, in terms of the program, what do you think, Mr. Suga?

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I think it's a little frustrating.

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
So...

22
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
One more time.

23
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
You said you didn't have a helmet.

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
You said you were serious about the sword.

25
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
It's better to do it.

26
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
It's dangerous, isn't it?

27
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
It's dangerous.

28
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
It doesn't matter if you can't see it.

29
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Let's do it when it's over.

30
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Let's do it.

31
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
However...

32
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
The rating was good for the end of the New Year.

33
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
It's called part 3.

34
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
You're still saying that.

35
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Stop it.

36
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Stop it.

37
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Stop it.

38
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Stop it.

39
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Stop it.

40
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Stop it.

41
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Stop it.

42
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Who are you talking to?

43
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I'm talking to you.

44
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm talking to you.

45
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I'm talking to you.

46
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I'm talking to you.

47
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I'm talking to you.

48
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Mr. Matsumoto, who has finally appeared, is back.

49
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I want to talk to you.

50
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I'm still talking to you.

51
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
It's still dark.

52
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
What do you mean?

53
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,000
The second time, you said you looked like you were wearing a helmet.

54
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
That's not possible.

55
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
That's the end of the story.

56
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I'm wondering if it's okay to end it there.

57
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I'm just wondering what the numbers are like.

58
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Well, it's a matter of numbers.

59
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I've been making progress like this.

60
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
But today...

61
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Are you going to do it?

62
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I don't know.

63
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I'll prepare it for you.

64
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
This is a good thing.

65
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
It's dangerous.

66
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
It's dangerous.

67
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Stop it.

68
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
8 horsepower.

69
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I think that's about it.

70
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
After all...

71
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:52,000
The viewers see me as a cartoonist.

72
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I don't think that's right.

73
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Why?

74
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Before that, it's like it starts and ends.

75
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
What?

76
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
You know that, right?

77
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:18,000
But I can't show you the two of them breathing.

78
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
You don't have to show me.

79
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I can't show you the down-to-earth breathing.

80
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
What are you laughing at?

81
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,000
What are you laughing at?

82
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
What are you laughing at?

83
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
What are you laughing at?

84
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Well...

85
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Let's get our minds together.

86
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Will you do that for me?

87
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Next time, do it right away.

88
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:26,000
As soon as I come in, I'll shake off my sword.

89
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Okay.

90
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Let's do it.

91
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:41,000
The time has come to make it come true.

92
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
The time has come.

93
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Ladies and gentlemen.

94
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Let's talk for another 30 minutes and go home.

95
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Today's opening was quite interesting.

96
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Today's opening was interesting.

97
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
You said the opening was interesting.

98
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I have something I have to say.

99
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
What is it?

100
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Matsumoto-kun's punishment game.

101
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
The second day of February.

102
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Wednesday.

103
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
From this air, it's the day after tomorrow.

104
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
It's Sunday, so it's the day after tomorrow.

105
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
From 4.57 a.m. on Wednesday.

106
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
For three minutes until 5 a.m.

107
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I'll do a live broadcast.

108
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
What was it before?

109
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I...

110
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Am I a fool?

111
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I was doing it.

112
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
At that time, I got three minutes.

113
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
It's going to be a show.

114
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Matsumoto-kun and...

115
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Okan's Akiko...

116
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
For three minutes, I'll do a manzai.

117
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Okan's Akiko will do a front-run.

118
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
It's really...

119
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
No, it's not that.

120
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I'll give you 100 manzai.

121
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Let's say okay.

122
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Why do you have to do it at 4.50 a.m.?

123
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I don't understand.

124
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,000
For three minutes, I have to do it.

125
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I'll do a live broadcast.

126
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I'll do a manzai.

127
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Manzai.

128
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I'll do it, but...

129
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I'll do it with two answers.

130
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Akiko will do it, too.

131
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
That's good.

132
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I asked the staff once.

133
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I don't know what he said.

134
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I asked him once.

135
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
He said yes.

136
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Before that, I was supposed to do a Goranger show.

137
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
From Hitoshi Ranger.

138
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
From Okan Ranger.

139
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
From Oton Ranger.

140
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
From Oni Ranger.

141
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
From Oni Ranger.

142
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I was supposed to do it with all five of them.

143
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
But there are many problems with Goranger.

144
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
The problem with the copyright.

145
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,000
But I asked my dad to do it first.

146
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
And he said he wanted to do it with all five of us.

147
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
He said yes.

148
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Your family is amazing.

149
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
What are you talking about?

150
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
That's what happened.

151
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
It was convenient.

152
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
That's right.

153
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
My dad said he didn't have to do it.

154
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
But my staff was paying attention.

155
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
My dad was so excited.

156
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
He said he didn't have to do it.

157
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,000
He was so excited.

158
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
But your dad will come, right?

159
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
My dad will come.

160
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
He will come to Onen.

161
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
He will come to Oikko.

162
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
The power is different.

163
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Who?

164
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
My family.

165
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I don't want him to refuse.

166
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
If you can watch it, please watch it.

167
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
If you can't watch it, you can watch it at the opening next week.

168
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
You can watch it at the opening next week.

169
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
You can watch it.

170
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
It's okay.

171
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
What I hate the most is...

172
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
With my mom...

173
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
We did it before.

174
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
When we were doing a comedy show.

175
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
We did it in the dressing room.

176
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I told my mom not to do it.

177
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I told her not to do it.

178
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
What do you think?

179
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
What do you think?

180
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I told my staff not to show it on camera.

181
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I told them to do it.

182
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Otherwise, you can't watch the real Akiko.

183
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I will make Akiko.

184
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I told them to do it.

185
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
But you need to show it.

186
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Yes, you need to show it.

187
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
You need to show the real Akiko.

188
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
You need to show the real Akiko.

189
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I'm looking forward to it.

190
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Please call me.

191
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I will think about it.

192
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
You don't need to think about it.

193
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
He said it.

194
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I will think about it.

195
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
You don't need to think about it.

196
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Please call me.

197
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I'm proud of you.

198
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
You don't have any shame.

199
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
That's your way.

200
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Everyone has their own way.

201
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I don't need to thank you.

202
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
No one has done it for me.

203
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I don't want to see it, but if it comes out, I don't want to see it.

204
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
My grandma.

205
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I don't want to say it's normal.

206
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
But I'm nervous.

207
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I understand that.

208
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I'm nervous.

209
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I'm going to show it more and more.

210
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Really.

211
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Wait a minute.

212
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
What kind of role do you play in the comic book?

213
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I have a small face.

214
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Akiko is a mother of a rock.

215
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I sing.

216
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I sing.

217
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I think so.

218
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Akiko has this.

219
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I don't want to do it!

220
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Miss Hawaii

221
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Miss Hawaii

222
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I have a vague image of her

223
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
But that's how it is

224
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
What do you think of her outfit?

225
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I think it's a moomoo

226
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
So it's Miss Hawaii

227
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I see

228
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
It's really lucky

229
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Normally you can't do it with her

230
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Why?

231
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
You can't do it with just the three of you

232
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Why?

233
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
If I lose this time it's because

234
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Your grandma and my grandma

235
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Will do a comic band with just the four of us

236
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Your grandma is a drummer

237
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
If she does this

238
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
She'll come out in front of you

239
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
She'll come out in front of you

240
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
It's just that

241
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I don't want to do it with your grandma in downtown

242
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I'll definitely do it

243
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
This week

244
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
What is it?

245
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Television?

246
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
It's not television

247
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
It's television

248
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
You're on TV but

249
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
It's more fun if you do it with your grandma

250
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Why would I do it with my grandma?

251
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
My grandma and my two shots

252
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
It's not that fun

253
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
But your two shots are really fun

254
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Is that so?

255
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
It's exactly the same

256
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I'll definitely do it

257
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I'll definitely do it

258
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I'll definitely do it

259
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I'll definitely do it

260
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I'll definitely do it

261
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
For now

262
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Wednesday

263
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Tomorrow morning

264
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Tomorrow morning

265
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
At 4.57

266
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I'll do it

267
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I'm looking forward to it

268
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I'm looking forward to it

269
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I have to say this

270
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
But it's cold this year

271
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
It's cold

272
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Why is it cold this year?

273
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Why is it cold?

274
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
It suddenly got cold

275
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
It suddenly got cold

276
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
It's already night

277
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
You're always playing the guitar

278
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
What is it?

279
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I'm asking you

280
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Why is it cold?

281
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I'm the one who's thinking

282
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I'm the one who's thinking

283
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I don't want to talk about that

284
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I don't want to talk about that

285
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I don't want to talk about that

286
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
But it's really cold this year

287
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Aren't you wearing a patch today?

288
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I'm wearing a patch

289
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I'm wearing a patch

290
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I'm wearing a patch

291
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I've been wearing a patch since last November

292
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
That's early

293
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Why are you like that?

294
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
You're still in your 30s

295
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Don't be silly

296
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
You're still in your 30s

297
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
You're still in your 30s

298
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
You're still in your 30s

299
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Sometimes in rock songs, you pronounce it like ta

300
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Sometimes in rock songs, you pronounce it like ta

301
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Ta

302
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
There are people who say ta

303
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Why do you say ta?

304
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
For example, Kenji Fukuyama

305
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
For example, Kenji Fukuyama

306
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Masaharu

307
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Kenji is...

308
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Masa?

309
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
How do you read this?

310
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I don't remember the name of the story

311
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I don't remember the name of the story

312
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I really don't remember

313
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I really don't remember

314
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
The kicker

315
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
The kicker is terrible

316
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
The kicker is terrible

317
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
The kicker is terrible

318
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
What was it?

319
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
What was it?

320
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Be My Baby

321
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Be My Baby

322
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
What was it?

323
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
What was it?

324
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
What was it?

325
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
What was it?

326
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
You're still in your 30s

327
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
What was it?

328
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
What was it?

329
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I don't understand what you're saying

330
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Be My Baby

331
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Be My Baby

332
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Be My Baby

333
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
That's how you sing it

334
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
What song was it?

335
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
What was the chorus part?

336
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Be My Baby

337
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Be My Baby

338
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
No

339
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
That's not it

340
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
That's not what I want to hear

341
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
You bastard

342
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
How did you become Be My Baby?

343
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
It's a dream

344
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
It's a dream

345
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
You can't sing it

346
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I want to sing it

347
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
It's a dream

348
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Doesn't anyone know?

349
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I know

350
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I know

351
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I know

352
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I won't tell you

353
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I won't tell you

354
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I know

355
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I won't tell you

356
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
You're everything

357
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Be My Baby

358
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Right?

359
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,000
You're young

360
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Be My Baby

361
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
That's not it

362
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
That's not it

363
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
What's wrong with you?

364
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Be My Baby

365
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Be My Baby

366
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
That's why

367
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
If you're on a singing show

368
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
You can't sing the lyrics

369
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
You can

370
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
But you can't sing the whole thing

371
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
You're singing that?

372
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
My mom is always angry

373
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
When she watches TV

374
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I don't know what she's saying

375
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
You're telling her to sing?

376
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I think

377
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Grandmas

378
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Should be able to sing

379
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
While doing the dishes

380
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
In the kitchen

381
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
But the grandma

382
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
She's like

383
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
She's like

384
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
She's like

385
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
She's like

386
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Be My Baby

387
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
That's not it

388
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Oh yeah

389
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
The other day

390
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
We were going to a drama

391
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
There were a lot of people from Tokyo

392
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Around

393
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
We were eating lunch

394
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Osaka's okonomiyaki is really good

395
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
That's what they say

396
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
When you go to a live show

397
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
They eat it

398
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Oh really?

399
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
It must be good

400
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I don't think the okonomiyaki in Tokyo is good

401
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
That's what they say

402
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Okonomiyaki

403
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
That's what they say

404
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Okonomiyaki

405
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I ate it a lot

406
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
What is okonomiyaki?

407
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
That's it

408
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
That's it

409
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
What is okonomiyaki?

410
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Okonomiyaki

411
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
There's rice

412
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Okonomiyaki

413
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Miso soup

414
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Pickles

415
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
This room

416
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
This reaction

417
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
This reaction

418
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I was really surprised

419
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
You guys are wrong

420
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Okonomiyaki and rice is really good

421
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Really

422
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Okonomi

423
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
It changes

424
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
You can eat as much rice as you want with one okonomiyaki

425
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I can eat

426
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
This is not a joke

427
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
When I say this

428
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
The next person will say

429
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Then I'll eat takoyaki with rice

430
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
That's what they say

431
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
But

432
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Think about it

433
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Don't underestimate me

434
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Does takoyaki go well with rice?

435
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
That's right

436
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
That's right

437
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
But okonomiyaki goes well with rice

438
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Don't you guys know the difference?

439
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I don't know

440
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I was alone

441
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I feel sorry for you

442
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I was crying

443
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
That's why I said

444
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:17,000
You can eat as much rice as you want

445
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
That's strange

446
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Don't cut it

447
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Miso soup

448
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Pickles

449
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
You can eat as much as you want

450
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Rice

451
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
It's really delicious

452
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
It's really delicious

453
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:41,000
I don't know

454
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,000
It's a luxury to eat only okonomiyaki

455
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
That's right

456
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
In a sense, it's like eating curry roux

457
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
That's right

458
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
You can only eat curry roux

459
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
That's not allowed

460
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
That's how it is in Osaka

461
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Then

462
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
If your grandmother forgets to cook rice

463
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
You can kill your whole family

464
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
You can kill

465
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Omoto

466
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
3, 2, 1

467
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Omoto

468
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Nomon

469
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
3, 2, 1

470
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Omoto

471
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Omoto

472
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Calm down

473
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
I don't know

474
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
I don't know
