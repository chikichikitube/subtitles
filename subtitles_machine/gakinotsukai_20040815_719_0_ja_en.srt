00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
In the first episode of Yaki no Tsukai, Chikichiki Yama-chan presents

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Summer Vacation! Nittere Jamboree Exhibition!

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I heard that you stepped on your partner's foot for the first time in a few years

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Really?

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
He stepped on it all of a sudden

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
And it was a fake, so please don't do it

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I don't want to do it anymore

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
What are you doing today, Yama-chan?

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Oh!

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Nittere Jamboree is doing a lot of things here

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
We're not doing it

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
We're doing it

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
What are you doing?

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
We're doing it like we're doing it in Odaiba

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
It's completely different from that

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
This T-shirt too

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
It's amazing

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'll give it to everyone later

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Please give it to everyone

20
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
There are a lot of event booths here, so let's go

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Are you here to see this?

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
We were doing a stage

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
It's Enta no Kami-sama

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
That's why it's not for us

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I see

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
But we're doing Enta no Kami-sama too

27
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
There's a return

28
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:20,000
The return

29
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
This program is brought to you by the following sponsors

30
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Nippon TV is holding an event this summer

31
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Nittere Jamboree

32
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
There are a lot of stage events

33
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Including the booths of the popular program

34
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Today, along with the booths for the kids

35
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
The DVD advertising director, Yama-chan

36
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Will show you around Nittere Jamboree

37
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
What is this?

38
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Do you want to try?

39
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
You can play with it

40
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
You can play with it

41
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
You can play with it

42
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
It's definitely fun

43
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
You can play with it

44
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Let's go

45
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Let's go

46
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I wonder if you can get it

47
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
You can get it

48
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
You can get it

49
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
You can get it

50
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Do it

51
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
It's Nittere Jamboree

52
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I'm sorry, Endo

53
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I'm sorry, Endo

54
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Everyone is watching

55
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
You did something bad to Endo

56
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Endo, you can't do that

57
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Can you listen to me?

58
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
It's my first time

59
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I'll show you how to do it

60
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
It was a great fight

61
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
After this, they will go around the venue

62
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
And enjoy the Jamboree

63
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
This is really Yamazaki

64
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
It's true

65
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Yamazaki is the main

66
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
And the booth for the kids

67
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Which is on the second floor of Nippon TV

68
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
The roof character festival

69
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000

70
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Welcome

72
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Please wear the helmet

73
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
It looks fun

74
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Are you okay?

75
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I'm excited

76
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
It's not

77
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
It's Heipo

78
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
It's Heipo

79
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
You're Ko-chan

80
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Ko-chan

81
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Ko-chan

82
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Ko-chan

83
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Welcome to Heipo

84
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
It's Heipo zone

85
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Next

86
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Please stand

87
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Here

88
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Tonight is Yamada

89
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Tonight is Yamada

90
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Tonight is Yamada

91
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
It's so fun

92
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
It's so fun

93
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Is this the end?

94
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
It's the end

95
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Look

96
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
It's so nostalgic

97
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
It's the second time

98
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Yes

99
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
This is

100
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
It's the 100th time

101
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
It's the name

102
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
It's so nostalgic

103
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
What's this?

104
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
It's Yamada

105
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
It's Yamada

106
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Tanaka

107
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
You can't touch it

108
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
You should put your hand in it

109
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
This is

110
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
It's dangerous

111
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I don't like it

112
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
What's wrong?

113
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
What's wrong?

114
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
What's this?

115
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Please try

116
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
It's dangerous

117
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
It's not hygienic

118
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
It's not hygienic

119
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
There's something

120
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
There's something

121
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
What's this?

122
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Everyone

123
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Look at this

124
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
It's like

125
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
It's like playing

126
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
It's like playing

127
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
It's like

128
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
It's like playing

129
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
It's like playing

130
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
It's like playing

131
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
There's something

132
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
There's something

133
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
There's something

134
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Can you see this?

135
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
What's this?

136
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Look at this

137
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
You were standing on the stage

138
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
You were standing on the stage

139
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
You mean on the roof?

140
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
We were looking at you

141
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
We were watching you

142
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I was doing it from the 2nd floor

143
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I was doing it from the 2nd floor

144
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Did you start to wear the costumes?

145
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Did you start to wear the costumes?

146
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:06,000
The famous character that appears in Gaki no Tsukai appears in a powerful 3D video!

147
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Wow, his butt, his butt!

148
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
His head, his head, his head!

149
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Wow, amazing!

150
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Ah, this guy.

151
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
He came out.

152
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
He came out.

153
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
He has a lot of spirit.

154
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
He has a lot of spirit.

155
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Please look forward to the next episode at the venue!

156
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Tanaka's hand is the most amazing.

157
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Tanaka's hand is the most amazing.

158
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
It was light, right?

159
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
His glasses are fine.

160
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
This is amazing.

161
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
This is amazing.

162
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
What is this? There are only Heipo.

163
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Heipo is falling down.

164
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
This is Toshin-dai.

165
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Ah, really?

166
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
This is Toshin-dai.

167
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Toshin-dai.

168
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I can meet Toshin-dai Po-chan.

169
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I've only seen him on TV, so this is the first time I've seen him.

170
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Ah, Heipo is like this.

171
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
This is the Kusami Championship.

172
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Koyori is also in Japan.

173
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Ah, really?

174
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Why don't you try Yamagaki?

175
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Ah, I...

176
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I...

177
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Should I do it?

178
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Should I do it?

179
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I want to take a picture of this.

180
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I want to take a picture of this.

181
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
It's a bit different.

182
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
It's a bit different.

183
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Hanakoyori.

184
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Hanakoyori.

185
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Ah, amazing.

186
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
This is the best.

187
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
This is the best.

188
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Ah, amazing.

189
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Ah, amazing.

190
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
This is the one.

191
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
This is the Kusami.

192
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
The Kusami.

193
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
This guy will never be able to do the Kusami.

194
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
He can't.

195
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
It's impossible.

196
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
It's the Po-chan Championship.

197
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
That's not true.

198
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
You'll be able to do it if you try it yourself.

199
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I'll try it.

200
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
You'll be able to do it if you try it yourself.

201
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I can't do it if I try it myself.

202
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Really?

203
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
You too?

204
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
You too?

205
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
This is the type that can do the Kusami.

206
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Ah, the Kusami.

207
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
It's like Kato-chan.

208
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
It's like Kato-chan.

209
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
The type that can do the Kusami.

210
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
The type that can do the Kusami.

211
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
The type that can't do it.

212
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
The last one is the sign on the panel as proof for today.

213
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
This is 2800 yen.

214
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
No, no, no.

215
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
The money is free.

216
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
It's free.

217
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
It's free.

218
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Really?

219
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
What is this?

220
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,000
At the exit of the booth, we received the DVD that will be released this month.

221
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
In addition, the original goods used by the kids are also on sale.

222
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
What is this?

223
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
It's an old lady's memo.

224
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
An old lady's memo.

225
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
It's an old lady's memo.

226
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:52,000
The members will also challenge the lottery that will be given to those who have reserved the DVD.

227
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Ah, Promide.

228
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Promide.

229
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Promide.

230
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
What, what, what?

231
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Show me, show me.

232
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
What is it?

233
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
It looks interesting.

234
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
This is...

235
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
There is no missing piece.

236
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
That's right.

237
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I don't know what it is.

238
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
It's missing.

239
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
It's missing.

240
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
It's missing.

241
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I also want to go.

242
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I also want to go.

243
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I also want to go.

244
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
How many are there?

245
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Three, three.

246
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
There are three capes.

247
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
This is missing.

248
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I want it.

249
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Ah, it's Promide.

250
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
It's out.

251
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Who's next? Who's next?

252
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Who's next?

253
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
It's a hit.

254
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
It's a hit.

255
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Seriously, damn it.

256
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
It's a live photo.

257
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I like Nakamura.

258
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Who?

259
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Who is it?

260
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Who is it?

261
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Who is it?

262
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Who is it?

263
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
It's missing.

264
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
It's missing.

265
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Is it this kind of box?

266
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
That's right.

267
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
It's all white.

268
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I see.

269
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
What happened today?

270
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
It's like Takaki Boo.

271
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Isn't it good?

272
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Also, if there's an ukulele...

273
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Don't make fun of Takaki Boo.

274
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I'm not making fun of him.

275
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Also, it's just an ukulele.

276
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I hope it's popular.

277
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I hope it's popular.

278
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I hope it's popular.

279
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I hope it's popular.

280
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I hope it's popular.

281
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
You know,

282
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I didn't want to talk about this,

283
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
but I heard a good story.

284
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
It's about Tanaka.

285
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I see.

286
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I happened to hear it from the staff.

287
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
A while ago,

288
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
on a show called Kokoriko,

289
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
he went to a location.

290
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
One of the staff went to the location.

291
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
The location lasted from morning to night.

292
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
After that,

293
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
he said,

294
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Good job.

295
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
At that time,

296
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I looked at Tanaka,

297
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
and he said,

298
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
His knees are dirty.

299
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
There's dirt on them.

300
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
There's mud on them.

301
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I wondered why.

302
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
When I thought about it,

303
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
the location on that day was

304
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
a location where I heard a lot of stories

305
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
from old people.

306
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I see.

307
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
When I talked to old people,

308
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Tanaka was kind,

309
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
so he put his knees on his knees

310
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
and listened to old people.

311
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
There was mud on his knees.

312
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Of course,

313
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Tanaka was very happy.

314
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
He said,

315
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Tanaka is a good boy.

316
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I see.

317
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I heard that story.

318
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I see.

319
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
He said,

320
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Can you tell me about this?

321
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Are you an idiot?

322
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Tell me about Tanaka.

323
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I didn't tell him about this story.

324
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I see.

325
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Cut here.

326
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
He came out and said,

327
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
We came out.

328
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I see.

329
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
He said,

330
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Can you tell me that you heard a story?

331
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Then,

332
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
He said,

333
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
What is it?

334
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I said,

335
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
What is it?

336
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
He said,

337
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
What is it?

338
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I said,

339
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
What is it?

340
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I said,

341
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
What is it?

342
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I said,

343
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I don't know.

344
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
What is the story of this person?

345
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
He said,

346
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
It's my first experience.

347
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I said,

348
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
What is it?

349
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I said,

350
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I don't know.

351
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
He said,

352
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
What is the story of this person?

353
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I said,

354
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I don't know.

355
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I don't know.

356
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I said,

357
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I don't have any idea.

358
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I said,

359
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Don't do it.

360
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I said,

361
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Let's go to Hakaki.

362
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Why am I such a strong person?

363
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I think it's good.

364
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
No, no, I've already heard all of this. It's not good to lie.

365
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,000
But I think there should be a lot of good stories about me.

366
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
No, I don't think so.

367
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
No one says that when I'm silent.

368
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
A little while ago, maybe half a year or a year ago,

369
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
when I was driving in the middle of the night,

370
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
there was a person who got drunk and fell down.

371
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I asked him, are you okay?

372
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,000
He said, if there's anything, I'll take you to the hospital.

373
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I did it. I really did it.

374
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
But to be honest, I was thinking,

375
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,000
send me to Deluxe in the middle of the night.

376
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I was thinking, send me, you guys.

377
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
There was another person who was drunk.

378
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I said, it's okay, it's okay.

379
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
He said, are you really okay?

380
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I'll go, but it's like Deluxe.

381
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Thank you.

382
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
When I got home, I thought, this is crazy.

383
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
He didn't come at all.

384
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Why is that?

385
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I can't see the bottom of my heart.

386
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
If you go to the hospital and go to the end,

387
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
it's not just the bottom of your heart, it changes into kindness.

388
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
That's true.

389
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I just said something good, didn't I?

390
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
The audience is screaming on the roof.

391
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
It doesn't matter.

392
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I do this kind of thing quite often.

393
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I pat children's heads.

394
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
If there's a child who's been watching at the game center for a long time,

395
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I give them 100 yen.

396
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I do that kind of thing.

397
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
It's definitely a lie.

398
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Why do you give 100 yen to a child who's been watching at the game center?

399
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
It's really weird.

400
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I don't do that kind of thing.

401
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
It's really weird.

402
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I don't do that kind of thing.

403
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
It's really weird.

404
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:18,000
What exactly is a melancholic night?

405
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Tell me.

406
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I'm already 40 years old.

407
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I've only thought of melancholic nights about 8 times.

408
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Actually, I don't know what melancholic night means.

409
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
That's right.

410
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
If you haven't received proper education, you wouldn't know.

411
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I think everyone knows.

412
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:52,000
That's why you've never had a melancholic night.

413
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Are you sad?

414
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I don't think so.

415
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I don't care about that.

416
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
It's my way of life.

417
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:04,000
It's embarrassing to say that you've never had a melancholic night.

418
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I see.

419
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I think it's embarrassing.

420
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I'm from Osaka.

421
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Tell me what a melancholic night means.

422
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
You're really a fool.

423
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
You're really a fool.

424
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Don't think that you can teach me everything in words.

425
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
There are things that are sensual.

426
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I'm going to steal that from you.

427
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Come on, steal it.

428
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Then I'll give it to you as a gift.

429
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
It's a three-digit number. Open it.

430
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I didn't say anything.

431
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
It's 229.

432
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Open it.

433
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I got it.

434
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
At times like this...

435
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Right, right, left.

436
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Shut up.

437
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Tell me what a melancholic night means.

438
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
That's right.

439
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:03,000
There are melancholic nights when you just watch TV at home.

440
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:09,000
And, for example, when you party and make a lot of noise.

441
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,000
There are also nights that aren't melancholic.

442
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Isn't there something?

443
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Isn't there something sensual?

444
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Then I'll tell you.

445
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
When you have three items,

446
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
it's a melancholic night.

447
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
That's a sudden increase.

448
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
It's a sudden increase.

449
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Then tell me what those three items are.

450
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Even if you don't tell me, I want you to know.

451
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I don't know, so tell me.

452
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Tell me what those three items are.

453
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I don't know, so tell me.

454
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
First, a deep kiss.

455
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
What is that?

456
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Have you ever had a deep kiss?

457
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I have had a deep kiss.

458
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
You idiot.

459
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
First, a deep kiss.

460
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I've heard of a deep kiss.

461
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Next, a fist bump.

462
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I've heard of it.

463
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Hey, after a deep kiss, a fist bump.

464
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
It's funny.

465
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Let's laugh a little more.

466
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
A fist bump.

467
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Here, a lot of human beings are dropped.

468
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
That's not going to happen.

469
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Here, the gas is scraped off.

470
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
That's not going to be melancholic.

471
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Why did you say a fist bump?

472
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
After a deep kiss.

473
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,000
But I think it's more like a deep kiss than you think.

474
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
It's between craftsmen.

475
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
That's a bit too much.

476
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
That's because you have a pickaxe like this.

477
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,000
And you have a sword like this.

478
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
That's a bit too much.

479
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
This is more melancholic than a fist bump.

480
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
A little more.

481
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Just a little more.

482
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
I didn't even get close.

483
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Really?

484
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
In that sense.

485
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
You have to hold a fist bump.

486
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
That's right.

487
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I think a fist bump is really amazing.

488
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Everyone says it's a fist bump.

489
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Because the dropped fist bump is in the right hand or the left hand.

490
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
That's right.

491
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I want you to bite that part.

492
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I want you to grab that part.

493
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Well...

494
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I think I went too far.

495
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Can't you tell me one last thing?

496
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Stop it.

497
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:10,000
If you say that, everyone will spend the night melancholic from tomorrow.

498
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I will.

499
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I can't forgive you for that.

500
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Do you have it at home?

501
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Do you have it at home?

502
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I think there are people who have it at home.

503
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Is that so?

504
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
But that's impossible.

505
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
You can't be melancholic.

506
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
You still don't understand.

507
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
You don't understand everything.

508
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Why are you giving up?

509
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
No!

510
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
If you give up...

511
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
You can't!

512
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Never!

513
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Why are you so serious?

514
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
It's just one more thing.

515
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,000
If you can do that, the melancholic night will be complete.

516
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I'll do it.

517
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Can I say it?

518
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I'm sorry.

519
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
It's a military base.

520
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
That's where everyone gets caught.

521
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I went to the military base with Deep Kiss.

522
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
I'm looking for a different place.

523
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
That's right.

524
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
It was under my feet.

525
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
That's why I went to the military base with Deep Kiss.

526
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
It's not a big deal.

527
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I don't want to say this, but it's a super melancholic night.

528
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Can I ask you one thing?

529
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Are both the military base and the military base?

530
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Of course.

531
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
The fingers of the military base are like this.

532
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Deep Kiss.

533
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Which one is the upper one?

534
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
If you want to be a super, you have to give me a plus.

535
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Yes.

536
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Then...

537
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
What do you mean?

538
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:49,000
I think some people want to have a melancholic night.

539
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
If there's an upper one...

540
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Of course there is.

541
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Then I'll tell you one more thing.

542
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
This is not a big deal.

543
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Is that so?

544
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Yes.

545
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
It's a mechanical pencil.

546
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
While doing this, with Deep Kiss, the military base, and the military base...

547
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Click, click, click, click, click.

548
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
This is a super melancholic night.

549
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Which one is it?

550
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
I don't know. I can't hear you. What?

551
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Which one is it?

552
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Which one is it?

553
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
It's 0.9.

554
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Which one is it?

555
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
What? I can't hear you.

556
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Both of them.

557
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Yes, both of them.

558
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
You usually use 0.5, right?

559
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
It's a little thicker than usual.

560
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Both of them.

561
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
What?

562
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
I can't hear you.

563
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Both of them.

564
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Both of them.

565
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I can't hear you.

566
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
This is like that.

567
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,000
If you put 0.9 in a 0.5 mechanical pencil, it won't open.

568
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
There will definitely be no melancholy.

569
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
You should have listened to the details.

570
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Of course.

571
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Melancholy won't come out even if you want it to.

572
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Melancholy will be stuck in there.

573
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:22,000
That's why I put melancholy in a 0.5 pen.

574
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
You put melancholy in a 0.5 pen?

575
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
What do you mean?

576
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
You put melancholy in a 0.5 pen?

577
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
You put 0.9 melancholy in a 0.5 pen?

578
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
That's strange. I don't get it.

579
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
You put melancholy in a 0.5 pen?

580
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
I don't get it. What's a melancholy pen?

581
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
I've never heard of it.

582
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
There's a melancholy pen.

583
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
0.9, right?

584
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
You should have said that.

585
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
You should have bought a normal 0.9 pen.

586
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
You should have bought a normal 0.9 pen.

587
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
It won't open.

588
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
No matter how many times you pull the string, it won't open.

589
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
That's strange.

590
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,000
You put melancholy in a 0.5 pen?

591
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
You should have said that.

592
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
I don't get it.

593
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
But...

594
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:19,000
If you don't want to talk, you can use a ballpoint pen.

595
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
You keep saying 0.9 all the time.

596
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:27,000
If I say it in detail, it can't be helped.

597
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
You put melancholy in a 0.5 pen?

598
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
I think it's sold in a melancholy shop.

599
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
You should have said that.

600
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:41,000
You should have said that.

601
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
That's strange.

602
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
There are two in Tokyo.

603
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
You should have said that.

604
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Kamen Rider.

605
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
That's strange.

606
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
You should have said that.

607
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
There are two in Kamen Rider.

608
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
You should have said that.

609
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:14,000
That's strange.
