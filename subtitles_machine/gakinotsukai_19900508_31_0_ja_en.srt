1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Ladies and gentlemen.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Today was a tough day.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
It was a tough day.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I think those who are here already know this.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Last week, at 6 o'clock,

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I said to Alta, come to the front.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I put out a teleprompter under the program.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
At 6 o'clock, I did a teleprompter.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Before that, there were a lot of people.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I couldn't see them.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
It was painful.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
If I had gone to Alta today,

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I would have done teleprompter.

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Idiot.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Do you have such energy?

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
How many people will go?

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Are you ready?

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
In the end, I couldn't broadcast it.

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
There were too many people.

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm going to the bathroom.

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I'm going to the bathroom.

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I'm going to the bathroom.

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I'm going to the bathroom.

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
It hurts.

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I will hold your hand.

26
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I will beat you.

27
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
What a pain.

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
At 1 o'clock in the afternoon, watch Downtown's Gaki no Tsukai, okay?

29
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:50,000
At 1 o'clock in the afternoon, watch Downtown's Gaki no Tsukai, okay?

30
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:57,000
At 1 o'clock in the afternoon, watch Downtown's Gaki no Tsukai, okay?

31
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:13,000
At 1 o'clock in the afternoon, watch Downtown's Gaki no Tsukai, okay?

32
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Watch Downtown's Gaki no Tsukai, okay?

33
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:55,000
At 1 o'clock in the afternoon, watch Downtown's Gaki no Tsukai, okay?

34
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:21,000
At 1 o'clock in the afternoon, watch Downtown's Gaki no Tsukai, okay?

35
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
If a cow gets killed for something like this, it won't do anything, right?

36
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Even though we know the name, we don't really know what it is.

37
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
It hurts.

38
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
It hurts, doesn't it?

39
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
It hurts.

40
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
What kind of game software is this?

41
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
It's a software touch, the rope.

42
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Really? Is it like this these days?

43
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I used to play it a lot when I was a kid.

44
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
You're lying!

45
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Masato-san!

46
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Yes?

47
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Yano-san, I'm going to tie you up here.

48
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Yano-san, I'm going to tie you up here.

49
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Hey, don't eat it!

50
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
It hurts! It hurts! It hurts!

51
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Shut up!

52
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
It hurts! It hurts!

53
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I'm going to pinch your hand!

54
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I'm going to pinch your hand!

55
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Ah, it hurts!

56
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Look, look!

57
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
It hurts! It hurts! It hurts!

58
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Shut up!

59
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
This is good!

60
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
This is good!

61
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
This is good!

62
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
This is the best!

63
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
This is the best!

64
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
This is the shape of the camera.

65
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
It was fast.

66
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
This is the shape of the camera.

67
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
This is the shape of the camera.

68
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
If you write the letter Man here, it's the Man of soy sauce.

69
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
This is good.

70
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
This is good.

71
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
That's all.

72
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Thank you for your hard work.

73
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Yano-san did a good job today.

74
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Yes.

75
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I'll do a proper promotion for my show.

76
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Thank you very much.

77
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Yano-san, let's go this way next time.

78
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Our show is over.

79
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Kayo... Kayo's 1 o'clock...

80
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
What?

81
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
What time is it?

82
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
What?

83
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Kayo's midnight is 1 o'clock and 40 minutes.

84
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I don't know how to write.

85
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Please watch it.

86
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Do you want to watch a show like this?

87
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
What?

88
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
What?

89
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Kayo's 1 o'clock and 40 minutes.

90
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I don't know how to write.

91
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Please watch it.

92
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I see.

93
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I was really embarrassed.

94
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I was more embarrassed than Nyororo.

95
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
It was close.

96
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
It was close.

97
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
It was a waste.

98
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Let's think of something.

99
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
This is this.

100
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
This is this.

101
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Yes.

102
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Let's take it to Shibuya.

103
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
109.

104
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Really?

105
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
This?

106
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
This.

107
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I've done the same thing many times.

108
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
You're not cool.

109
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I'm looking forward to it, Hama-chan.

110
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
What are you talking about?

111
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
You know it yourself.

112
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
You know you have to make me do something.

113
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Well, it was like this.

114
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Yes.

115
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Kayo-san, are you here?

116
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Thank you very much.

117
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Let's do something again.

118
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
If we gather like this, we can do something on this show.

119
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Yes.

120
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Other than that.

121
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
We don't have to open our eyes.

122
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
We don't have to open our eyes.

123
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
We can do something in a big hall.

124
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
That's good.

125
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
That's good.

126
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I don't know about this.

127
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I think you said it.

128
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Let's do something.

129
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Let's do something.

130
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
An event.

131
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Yes.

132
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Something exciting.

133
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
An event?

134
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Yes.

135
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
You're right.

136
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
In April of next year,

137
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I want to take a bus or something like that.

138
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I'm going to study.

139
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I don't want to do that.

140
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Why?

141
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I don't want to force myself to do that.

142
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I don't want to.

143
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Let's do it.

144
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I don't want to.

145
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I'm going to help you.

146
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
What are you talking about?

147
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I don't want to do that.

148
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Why?

149
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I'm going to go to university.

150
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
You're going to go to university.

151
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Let's get a certificate.

152
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
A certificate.

153
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
On this show.

154
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Isn't it?

155
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Certificate.

156
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Yes.

157
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Something special.

158
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Something something.

159
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Something something.

160
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I can makeRadio.

161
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Like farting.

162
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Covering your face like this.

163
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
fails the grade.

164
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
It's not bad, but how're you going to shoot.

165
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Something at the set shouldn't do.

166
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Before the show.

167
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
It means...

168
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
It means...

169
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
That's right. That's one of the reasons why I can't do anything about it.

170
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Well, I'd like to think about it again.

171
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I'm really sorry about today.

172
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
It can't be helped.

173
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Yes.

174
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Well, let's lower this a little bit.

175
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Yes.

176
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Well, in that case, what shall we do after this?

177
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
What shall we do after this?

178
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Yes.

179
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Well, the postcard...

180
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Shibitori? That's not good.

181
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
That's enough.

182
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
What about the postcard?

183
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Let's read the postcard.

184
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Let's take a picture of it.

185
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Here you are. What do you think about today's postcard?

186
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
What is this?

187
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Where have you been hiding until now?

188
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
What?

189
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
How old are you?

190
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Four years old?

191
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Yes.

192
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
What's your name?

193
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I'm Aya Suzuki.

194
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
What?

195
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I'm Aya Suzuki.

196
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Aya Suzuki?

197
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Yes.

198
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
What?

199
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Oh, this is it.

200
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
This is it.

201
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Oh, this is it.

202
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
There's a picture in it.

203
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Oh, you're looking for an assistant?

204
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Yes, an assistant.

205
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
This is it.

206
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Her name is Aya Suzuki.

207
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
My wife and I are big fans of Downtown.

208
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
We were offered to be the assistant of the program.

209
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
She accepted it.

210
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Are you kidding me?

211
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
She didn't accept it.

212
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
My wife and I were offered to be the assistant of the program.

213
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Is that so?

214
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Which do you like, Aya?

215
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Why do you like this man?

216
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
What do you like about him?

217
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
What?

218
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
You don't know?

219
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
What do you like about him?

220
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I can't talk to you anymore.

221
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
It's been a long time since I last saw you.

222
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
You look like a young girl.

223
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I see.

224
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Aya, thank you for coming again.

225
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Where did you come from?

226
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Where did you come from?

227
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Tokyo.

228
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Do you know that?

229
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Where in Tokyo?

230
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
A hotel.

231
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
A hotel?

232
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:18,000
A love hotel?

233
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
What's with your reaction?

234
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
It's like you know.

235
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Is that so?

236
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
When you grow up, I'll marry you.

237
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Don't do that.

238
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
You'll get a bad name.

239
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I'm waiting for you.

240
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Are you serious?

241
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I'm waiting for you.

242
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
You can't lie to me.

243
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
You can't cheat on me.

244
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I can't do that either.

245
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Come again next time.

246
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Thank you.

247
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Thank you.

248
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Bye-bye.

249
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I have one more.

250
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I'll start with Nakano-kun.

251
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Miwa-chan, Yuna-san.

252
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Good evening, Matsumoto-san.

253
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Good evening.

254
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I always enjoy watching you.

255
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:15,000
A few weeks ago, you said that you were mistaken for the driver of the taxi, Hiromi-san.

256
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Actually, when my mother was in the taxi, the driver made a mistake.

257
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
The driver said,

258
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
It's always hard, isn't it?

259
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I was watching.

260
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
It's always hard, isn't it?

261
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
My mother replied,

262
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
It was hard to hear.

263
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I said,

264
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Thank you.

265
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
And the driver smiled at his mother again.

266
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:41,000
You're still being called a teacher, aren't you?

267
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
That's right.

268
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
My mother was mistaken for Tetsuya Takeda.

269
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,000
After my mother came home, she went to the barber shop and went back to the short hair.

270
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Matsumoto-san, Matsumoto-san,

271
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Did anyone else make a mistake?

272
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Hey.

273
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,000
The worst mistake I've ever made was,

274
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
This is the best of all.

275
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I think I've told myself once.

276
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I think I've told myself once.

277
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
That was about six years ago.

278
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Yokosuka incident.

279
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I went to Yokosuka to shoot Mr. Donuts commercial.

280
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
That was Yokosuka, wasn't it?

281
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Was it?

282
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I was staying at a hotel in Yokosuka.

283
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
With my manager.

284
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I was so hungry at night.

285
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I couldn't stand it anymore.

286
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
There must be a Yoshinoya or something somewhere.

287
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I thought I'd go.

288
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I didn't even know his face.

289
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I was walking around the hotel at about 2 o'clock at night.

290
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:49,000
There were about five middle school students.

291
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I was a little drunk.

292
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I didn't want to get involved in this mess.

293
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I ignored it as much as I could.

294
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I tried not to get involved.

295
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
One of them came up to me and said,

296
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Yu-chan, where are you going?

297
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I called you Yu-chan.

298
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I called you Yu-chan.

299
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I don't know where Yu-chan is.

300
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I thought, what's wrong with him?

301
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I thought I'd quit right away.

302
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I was walking all the way.

303
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Yu-chan!

304
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Yu-chan!

305
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
He kept following me.

306
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
He kept calling me Yu-chan.

307
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
It was a dark place.

308
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
No matter what I say now, he's drunk.

309
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
There's nothing I can do about it.

310
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
He came all the way to the bright place.

311
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I'm not Yu-chan.

312
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I'm going to make it clear to him.

313
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I put up with the dark place.

314
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
To the bright place.

315
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
To the bright place.

316
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Yu-chan! Yu-chan!

317
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
He's been following me all the way.

318
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
When he came to the bright place,

319
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
What is it?

320
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I looked back.

321
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Yu-chan, don't get angry.

322
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I know he's angry.

323
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I know he's angry, but I don't know if he's not Yu-chan.

324
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
He ran away so much.

325
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
He ran away so much, he was in the town.

326
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
About two kilometers away.

327
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
You should go home.

328
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
You didn't want to eat jyu-don like that.

329
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I didn't want to eat it.

330
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
He kept following me.

331
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Yu-chan, don't get angry.

332
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Don't be like that.

333
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,400
So I stopped and told him not to talk to me, and told him to come over here.

334
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:30,320
I'm not Yu-chan!

335
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:34,760
I'm talking, but you can tell, right? I'm from Osaka!

336
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,960
I'm Yu-chan!

337
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:39,840
I was so scared!

338
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:42,480
I was like, what the hell is Yu-chan talking about?

339
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,120
You were flustered.

340
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,320
I couldn't do anything about it.

341
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:51,240
So I kept thinking, I can't do this anymore, so I went back to the hotel.

342
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:54,600
I went back to the hotel, and when I got to the front of the hotel, Yu-chan, where are you going?

343
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,120
I'm going to get in trouble!

344
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,520
You can't do that, Yu-chan!

345
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,480
Really?

346
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,440
I'm telling the truth!

347
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,640
I'm starting to get angry.

348
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,240
I'm telling the truth!

349
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:11,160
So I went to the front of the hotel, and I had my keys.

350
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:14,280
And the hotel there was covered in glass.

351
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:16,040
You couldn't see it from the outside.

352
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:21,480
And when I was holding the keys at the front of the hotel, I was looking at it like this.

353
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:27,120
And when I got out of the elevator, went in, and closed the door...

354
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:31,320
What?

355
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:35,760
It's fun to watch people's movements, right?

356
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:36,440
Movements?

357
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,040
It's fun to watch people's movements, right?

358
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,600
I call it movement.

359
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,640
There are a lot of things, right?

360
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:48,120
There's an old lady's toothpick.

361
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:51,560
I was so angry.

362
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:55,560
I can't just pull out my teeth and do this.

363
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,880
I can't just pull out my teeth and do this.

364
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,560
This hand was so angry.

365
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,640
The little finger was floating.

366
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:03,720
I knew what you were doing.

367
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,560
I knew you were doing it.

368
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:08,040
I knew what you were doing.

369
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:10,240
I was like, what is this?

370
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,960
But as a woman, it's normal to do this.

371
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,520
No matter how many times you do it.

372
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:19,600
But you put a lid on something that stinks.

373
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,520
What do you mean?

374
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,640
You put a lid on something.

375
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,640
No, no, no.

376
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:28,920
I'm trying to hide my dirty part.

377
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:33,080
I know that, so I don't think I need it anymore.

378
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:38,280
It's more annoying to be told that.

379
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:41,520
I don't want to be seen as a toothpick.

380
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,280
I don't want to be seen as a toothpick.

381
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:48,160
If that's the case, I'd do it like this when I'm writing here.

382
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,800
I can't do it.

383
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,400
I can't do it.

384
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,880
I can't do it.

385
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,920
I can't do it.

386
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:58,760
I can't do it.

387
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:02,320
It's not embarrassing to write here.

388
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,920
It's embarrassing to do it like this.

389
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,200
Why?

390
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,360
My teeth and gums are all out.

391
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:11,240
If I can take it out, I'll be in trouble.

392
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:13,280
I don't care if you hide it.

393
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:17,360
It's just a thing to do at 10 o'clock.

394
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,120
I'm writing here.

395
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,960
I know that.

396
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:25,120
It's more annoying.

397
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,600
I don't want to be seen as a toothpick.

398
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:32,440
If it's a nose, I'd do it like this.

399
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:35,200
I don't think it's good.

400
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,880
I don't want to be seen as a toothpick.

401
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,920
It's fun to watch that kind of thing.

402
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:43,160
When I went to Thailand before,

403
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:48,560
I was eating other people's food.

404
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,360
I was eating alone.

405
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:52,280
We were drinking beer together.

406
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,280
It was hot in the afternoon, so we went to Thailand.

407
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:57,000
The local person on the other side said,

408
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,840
There's a long spaghetti called pasta.

409
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:07,280
It's a combination of pasta and meat.

410
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:14,240
It's a good food to eat with the local person.

411
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:18,200
I usually eat pasta.

412
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:25,000
When I eat meat and vegetables together,

413
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,880
I eat it with a smile that I can't stand.

414
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:37,080
It's fun to watch that kind of thing while drinking beer.

415
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,600
It's fun to watch that kind of thing while drinking beer.

416
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,560
It was fun the other day.

417
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:43,720
I went to a coffee shop.

418
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:46,400
I was shopping at Daimaru.

419
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,400
I had a bag.

420
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,480
I sat down.

421
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,120
I was drinking coffee.

422
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:54,240
I was looking at the paper bag.

423
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:54,880
Are you laughing?

424
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,800
I'm laughing.

425
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:03,360
I'm laughing.

426
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,200
I grabbed it.

427
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,800
I'm glad I did it.

428
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:07,680
I'm glad I did it.

429
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:10,720
I'm glad I did it.

430
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,400
I opened the ribbon.

431
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,680
I opened the ribbon.

432
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,480
You opened it.

433
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,920
I opened it.

434
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:20,480
I left the paper bag slowly.

435
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,600
I left the paper bag slowly.

436
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:28,280
I opened the paper bag slowly.

437
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:29,320
It's hard.

438
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:30,320
I understand.

439
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:33,760
I opened the ribbon.

440
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,320
I opened the ribbon.

441
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:37,560
I opened the ribbon.

442
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:40,080
I opened the ribbon.

443
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,280
There is a comb.

444
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,200
There is a comb.

445
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,840
There is a comb.

446
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:52,400
I pulled out the comb from the plastic bag.

447
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:59,000
I pulled out the comb from the plastic bag.

448
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,760
What is this guy?

449
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:08,000
I wanted to go here as soon as possible.

450
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,560
That's funny.

451
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,320
I was in a car.

452
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,400
I was parking in Shingo-machi.

453
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,920
There is a comb from the other side.

454
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:24,320
There is a comb from the other side.

455
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,960
There is a comb from both sides.

456
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:30,720
I was in a car.

457
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,520
There is a comb.

458
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:35,720
There is a comb.

459
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:36,560
One person's comb.

460
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:37,320
One person's comb.

461
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:42,040
I thought there was a comb.

462
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:46,760
There is another comb.

463
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:54,000
I was wrong.

464
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,200
This doesn't馴 análize anything.

465
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:03,680
Let's look at people together again.

466
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:09,440
It's time.

467
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:13,600
We've seen a nice thing here.

468
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,440
Let's think about something again.

469
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,560
Let's think about it next time.

470
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:18,560
Let's do it again.

471
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,560
Everyone, thank you very much for today.

472
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,560
Please come and see us again.

473
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:26,560
Hello.

474
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:29,560
I think the people who are watching the TV right now have noticed something.

475
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,560
What do you think of this?

476
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,560
You don't look back.

477
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:37,560
Actually, this is the front, but the back is like this.

478
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,560
Staff G.

479
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,560
Staff G has been completed.

480
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:48,560
I haven't decided on a gift yet, so if you want it, give me a postcard.

481
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,560
I'll do it when I'm in the team.

482
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:53,560
I don't know what it's like to look at the postcard.

483
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:57,560
I'll do it when I look at the postcard.

484
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:59,560
This one.

485
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:01,560
I'm waiting for the postcard.

486
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,560
I'll think about it after that.

487
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:05,560
For the time being, the staff and we all have it.

488
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,560
Everyone is coming.

489
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,560
It's okay.

490
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:11,560
Because it costs a lot of money.

491
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:13,560
That's right.

492
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:17,560
At that time, the girl will be an assistant.

493
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,560
I think that kind of thing is also possible.

494
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:21,560
I'm still looking for an assistant.

495
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:23,560
Yes.

496
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:25,560
I'll send it to you.

497
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:28,560
That's all I have to say.

498
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:31,560
That's all for this time.

499
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,560
Goodbye.

500
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:45,560
This program was brought to you by Sunlux and the sponsor you are watching.
