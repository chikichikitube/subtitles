1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
It's been a long time since I've seen this.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
This is a very interesting pair of gloves.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
This is a very energetic guest.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
What is this?

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
It looks like a civilian's helmet.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
This program is brought to you by these sponsors.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Do you remember me?

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
What do you mean?

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I'm sorry, but...

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
What are you talking about?

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The Japanese series, right?

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Yes.

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Hageoka.

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
It was last week or the day before last week.

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Yes.

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I was with the Titans.

18
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
And you were with the West.

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
You said something like that, didn't you?

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
No, I didn't say anything like that.

21
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
You said something like the Nihon Seiyon.

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm sorry, but I've won four times in a row.

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
You've won four times in a row, right?

24
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I even drank beer.

25
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Oh, you did.

26
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I was in a commercial, and I didn't know who was going to win.

27
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
You didn't know.

28
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I didn't know.

29
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
You said you were going to the West.

30
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I did say that, but in the end...

31
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
It wasn't in the end.

32
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
In the end, I said, let's go the other way.

33
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
In the end, I won.

34
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
No, no, no.

35
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
That's what happened, right?

36
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Yes, that's what happened.

37
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Well, that's obvious.

38
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
No, no, no.

39
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Something like a punishment?

40
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
No.

41
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Are you misunderstanding something?

42
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
No, no, no.

43
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I don't care if I'm not a West player.

44
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I don't care if the West loses.

45
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I don't care if the West loses.

46
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
No, no, no.

47
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
There's still a video left.

48
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Well, next week.

49
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
A punishment game that you can do at the opening.

50
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Um, that one?

51
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Are you going to cut it?

52
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
That was when I lost.

53
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
You said you were going to cut it, right?

54
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
That was about a few days ago.

55
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
It's rare, but I've lived 39 years.

56
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I've been there about three or four times.

57
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I had a pimple, and the moment I stood up, I stepped on it.

58
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
It hurts a lot, doesn't it?

59
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
No, no, no.

60
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Shut up!

61
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:13,000
It hurts a lot, and it's embarrassing.

62
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
It hurts a lot, and it's embarrassing.

63
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Well, it doesn't matter if you step on it.

64
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
It's a punishment game. Next week.

65
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
From now on, we're going to talk about the pay-off.

66
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Why pay-off?

67
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Where are you going to connect it?

68
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
This is the fun part of the talk.

69
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Next week, we're going to have a punishment game.

70
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Are you thinking about it?

71
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Well, if you do this...

72
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Who is that?

73
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
If the giant loses, it's like there was nothing like that.

74
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Is that possible?

75
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
If I lost, I would have lost.

76
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
It's like there was nothing like that.

77
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
You should have been talking normally.

78
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
100,000 yen, 50,000 yen, I don't know what fate is.

79
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I knew it for sure.

80
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
It's the same as my father's divorce.

81
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I'm going to talk like there was nothing.

82
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Oh, you're going to talk like Joichi.

83
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
No, no, I'll do it.

84
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I'll keep that in mind.

85
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
What?

86
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
No way!

87
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Then tell me how it feels.

88
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
What?

89
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I don't care if you get beat up or not.

90
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
What does that mean?

91
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
You didn't tell me to wear it or anything.

92
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I'm going to be very violent.

93
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I'm going to talk a lot.

94
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
It's because I'm a kid.

95
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Then tell me how it feels.

96
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
What does it feel like?

97
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I'm going to be very scary.

98
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I'll just tell you how it feels.

99
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
That's what the punishment game is.

100
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
That's what the punishment game is.

101
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,500
If you go into a shop and ask if you want to eat curry, they'll give you curry.

102
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,200
This is the first time I'm eating curry at this shop.

103
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:51,200
I can't eat it because there's a curry menu.

104
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,000
I don't know what it is, but if it gets in my mouth, it's scary!

105
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Say it!

106
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
There's no point in saying it, it's a punishment game.

107
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,200
You can't make me do anything.

108
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,200
There's no point in saying it, it's a punishment game.

109
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I know.

110
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I know.

111
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I know, but I don't want to say it.

112
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I don't want to say it's a punishment game.

113
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
It's just like that.

114
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
But it's the atmosphere.

115
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
It's really scary.

116
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
What is it?

117
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I can't spend that much money on the opening.

118
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
It's really scary.

119
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
If you make one mistake, I'll tell you what it's like.

120
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
What is it?

121
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
If you make one mistake...

122
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
If you're strong, your bones won't break.

123
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
If you're strong, your bones won't break.

124
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
That's nice.

125
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
That's nice.

126
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
You can't do anything physical.

127
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I know.

128
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
You can only do things that suit your style.

129
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
If that's the case, I can do a lot of things.

130
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Are you stupid?

131
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I'm not stupid.

132
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I'm not stupid.

133
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I'm not stupid.

134
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I'm not stupid.

135
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I'm not stupid.

136
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Are you stupid?

137
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
What?

138
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I'm not stupid.

139
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I'm not stupid.

140
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I can tell that you're stupid.

141
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I'm not stupid.

142
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Why?

143
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
You're more stupid.

144
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I'm not stupid.

145
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I'm not stupid.

146
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I'm really not stupid.

147
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
It's okay. Just enjoy it.

148
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I can't enjoy it.

149
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
It's okay.

150
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
You can't get hurt.

151
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Don't show up with someone you miss.

152
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I hate it.

153
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I hate it a lot.

154
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
And don't do things like lying down.

155
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I don't do things like lying down.

156
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
It's really scary.

157
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
When you got hit by Jimmy, you were like a fool.

158
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I didn't get hit.

159
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I don't do things like lying down.

160
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I'll tell you this.

161
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
When you're on a variety show like this,

162
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
there are a lot of complaints.

163
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
That's bullying.

164
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
That's not good for education.

165
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
A little thing like that can cause complaints.

166
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I don't think it's that kind of thing.

167
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I don't think it's bullying.

168
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
But lying down is bullying.

169
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Why is that?

170
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,000
When you wake up, you're like a Tohyo person that everyone knows.

171
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
It's really scary.

172
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Everyone is laughing at me.

173
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
It's really scary.

174
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
They know me. They know me.

175
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Why am I here?

176
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
It's really strange.

177
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
It's fine.

178
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I don't do things like that in the Japanese series.

179
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
You're the one who said it.

180
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Right?

181
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Why did you say it twice?

182
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I didn't say it.

183
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
If I had lost, I would have been in trouble.

184
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Did I say that I was a seibu?

185
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Please take a look.

186
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Which do you think it is?

187
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I think it's a giant.

188
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Really?

189
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I'm a giant fan, so I have to support a giant.

190
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
But I really think it's a seibu.

191
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Shall we bet?

192
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
It's a giant seibu.

193
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Really?

194
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Yes.

195
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
It's been a while.

196
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
It's fine.

197
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
It's a giant seibu.

198
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I didn't say it.

199
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
You didn't say it.

200
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I didn't say it.

201
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
You just took a giant seibu.

202
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Don't say that.

203
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
You should have taken it.

204
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
You should have told me to be a giant.

205
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
You were confident in seibu, right?

206
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Next week?

207
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I don't think I can win next week.

208
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Last week, I bet on beer.

209
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I bet on beer.

210
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
It's like a punishment game.

211
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I want to kiss a grandma of a punch bag.

212
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I want to kiss her.

213
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I want to kiss her.

214
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I want to kiss her.

215
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I want to kiss her.

216
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
You're desperate.

217
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
You're hungry.

218
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I like kiss.

219
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I know.

220
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I've never done it before.

221
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I can't believe it.

222
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Let's move on.

223
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Okay.

224
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Go ahead.

225
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
It's a big boy.

226
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,000
This is a question for Matsumoto-san, who has been taken to the 18th space station.

227
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,000
You said that the 13th time was the most memorable.

228
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Why is that?

229
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Ah, yes, yes, yes.

230
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I was taken away so many times.

231
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Almost continuously.

232
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
18 times?

233
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Yes.

234
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Continuously? What do you mean?

235
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
There were times when I was only free for 3 hours.

236
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Can you come back once?

237
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
It was over when I watched a video.

238
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Why were you taken away?

239
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
It was over when I watched a video.

240
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
When I watched a video of Godfather, it was over when I finished watching it.

241
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Please show it to me.

242
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Then why did you return it?

243
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
It was about 3 hours.

244
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Please show me Godfather in UFO.

245
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
No, no.

246
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I was taken away so many times.

247
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
What?

248
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I was taken away so many times.

249
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
There are many reasons for that.

250
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
There are many patterns.

251
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
There are many patterns.

252
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
The picture is like this.

253
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
How is it?

254
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Well, the most orthodox one that everyone knows is when UFO comes.

255
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Yes.

256
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
And it is exposed to light.

257
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Ah, yes, yes.

258
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
And it is gently sucked up.

259
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Ah, yes, yes.

260
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
There was a pattern like that.

261
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
While walking somewhere?

262
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Yes.

263
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,000
If you look at it, it looks like everyone is taken away to paradise.

264
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
What?

265
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
It is quite difficult.

266
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
What is that?

267
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
It is going up smoothly.

268
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
No, it hurts a lot here.

269
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
It is going up smoothly.

270
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
No, you are using your teeth.

271
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
No, no, no.

272
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Are you stupid?

273
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
You are like the light.

274
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Do you really think that it will go up?

275
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
If it is a movie, it will be like that.

276
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
If it is a movie, it will be like that.

277
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
You can make it like this.

278
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Like this.

279
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Like this.

280
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
It hurts, it hurts, it hurts, it hurts.

281
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
You can put a sponge here and a sponge here.

282
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
You can put a sponge here and a sponge here.

283
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Really?

284
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
No, it is not.

285
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
It is going up.

286
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
What is the inside like?

287
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,000
The inside is, how to say, it is like a square.

288
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Are you stupid?

289
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
It is wide.

290
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
It is wide.

291
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
There are many things like that.

292
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Oh, yes.

293
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Where are you going to take it first?

294
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
If it goes up, where are you going to take it?

295
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
The Japanese room.

296
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I am sorry.

297
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
What?

298
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
What is it like to be an alien?

299
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
It is like a work uniform.

300
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Yes, yes, yes.

301
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
What is it like around here?

302
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
It is bumpy.

303
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Bumpy?

304
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Bumpy.

305
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Is it a pig?

306
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
No, it is bumpy.

307
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
It is bumpy.

308
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
What color is it?

309
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
What?

310
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
What color is it?

311
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
It is a love color.

312
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
It is a complicated color.

313
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
It is a love color.

314
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
It is more popular than you.

315
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I think so.

316
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
It is a lot.

317
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
It is a lot.

318
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
So?

319
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
When you go home, there are a lot of bumpy things.

320
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
There are a lot of bumpy things.

321
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
So?

322
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
You do not understand the word.

323
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:14,000
It is said that you can laugh when you are bumpy.

324
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
You do not understand the word.

325
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
First, it comes to your brain.

326
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I see.

327
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Yes, yes, yes.

328
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
It is said that you should listen to what it says when you are bumpy.

329
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Oh, we are?

330
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Yes, yes, yes.

331
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Yes, yes, yes.

332
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
When you become Kachikata...

333
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Eh? Kachikata?

334
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
When you become Kachikata, you do not understand the word.

335
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
It is a bit of a threat.

336
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
This is a threat.

337
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I see.

338
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
You should listen to what it says.

339
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
You should listen to what it says.

340
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
You should take off your clothes.

341
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
First of all.

342
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Yes.

343
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Then?

344
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I was given something like a garbage can.

345
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Yes.

346
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
It is surprisingly small.

347
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
A garbage can.

348
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Yes.

349
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I wondered if I could fit in.

350
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I was quite depressed.

351
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I said, can I fit in?

352
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I was about to become Kachikata.

353
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
You should not get angry at such a thing.

354
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
You will soon be Kachikata.

355
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
They are.

356
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I see.

357
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I am scared.

358
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I see.

359
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Yes.

360
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
When you take off your clothes, it means you are barefoot.

361
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I became barefoot.

362
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Yes, yes, yes.

363
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Then?

364
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I was given a lot of embarrassing things.

365
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I see.

366
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Yes.

367
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
What is that?

368
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Is it that you are examining your body?

369
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Yes, it is.

370
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Yes.

371
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Yes.

372
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I was given painful things.

373
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I was given a lot of painful things.

374
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
What kind of things?

375
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I was given a lot of painful things.

376
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Why do you do that?

377
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
It seemed like I was joking.

378
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
You should not be so stupid.

379
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
It was an examination.

380
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I was given a lot of painful things.

381
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I looked like an adult when I was given a painful thing.

382
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I said, hey!

383
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
And I was told, hey!

384
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Hey!

385
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
You just said it!

386
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I don't know! I don't know!

387
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
You're an idiot.

388
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
They were children.

389
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I don't know which one is a child and which one is an adult.

390
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
It's not that they're big, so they're adults, and small, so they're not children.

391
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Their body sizes are the same.

392
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Oh, is that so?

393
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
That's right.

394
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Yeah.

395
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
It's been this long.

396
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
What are you going to do in the end?

397
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
What do you mean?

398
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
If you investigate everything, they'll return it to you.

399
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
So I got a stamp card like this.

400
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
And then I went,

401
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,000
It's the first time, so can you give me two?

402
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
There are 24, so don't take it!

403
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
You're going to get hurt.

404
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I'm going to go.

405
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I'm going to go, but I'm still going.

406
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch!

407
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I'm going to go like a sponge.

408
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I'm still going.

409
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I'm going to go like a sponge.

410
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Oh, like a sponge.

411
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I'm going to go like a sponge.

412
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
That's right, that's right.

413
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
And then it's red here.

414
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
And then when I got hurt,

415
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Why is this so red?

416
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
You!

417
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I've been saying this all the time.

418
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
18 times.

419
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
It's always this.

420
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
But all 24 stamps are not full.

421
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
It's only 18 times.

422
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
That's right.

423
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
So I got a handbook.

424
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Not a handbook, but a college notebook.

425
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
What is it?

426
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Why a college notebook?

427
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I got a pencil and a notebook.

428
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
That's because it's been over 10 times.

429
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
It's been over 10 times.

430
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Aoyama-san.

431
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Oh, is that so?

432
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,000
If you go 20 times, it's a CD Walkman.

433
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Right now.

434
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Why is it right now?

435
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
No.

436
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
It's not even called the worst.

437
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Okonomiyaki has Hiroshima-yaki, Osaka-yaki, etc.

438
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I heard that Matsumoto has original Matsumoto-yaki.

439
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
What kind of yaki is it?

440
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
If possible, I'd like to make it for you.

441
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Matsumoto-yaki?

442
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Yes.

443
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Is that so?

444
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
It's not sudden, is it?

445
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Then tell me the ingredients.

446
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
The ingredients are basically the same.

447
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Okonomiyaki and Matsumoto.

448
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
What's the difference?

449
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
What's the difference between Okonomiyaki and Matsumoto?

450
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
You're probably wondering what's being added.

451
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
That's right.

452
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
It's different.

453
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
What do you mean?

454
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Matsumoto-yaki's main goal is to make something delicious without using anything that was never used.

455
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I see.

456
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
So there's nothing to add?

457
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:28,000
To be clear, there's no cassette stove.

458
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:33,000
I put the iron plate directly on the tatami.

459
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
But there's a gun.

460
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
There's a gun.

461
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Why is there a gun?

462
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Why is there a gun?

463
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
And then I turn it over.

464
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Don't turn it over!

465
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
The whole family is going to be in trouble.

466
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
It's going to be a mess.

467
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
And then...

468
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
It's not hot.

469
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Next...

470
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
It's going to be like that.

471
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I'm going to eat it raw.

472
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:08,000
This is Matsumoto-yaki's main goal.

473
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
It's funny.

474
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Once a week...

475
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
It's funny, isn't it?

476
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
The pen name is Begirama-san.

477
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
It's funny, isn't it?

478
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Shut up!

479
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Once a week, Mr. Matsumoto says that he always checks new products in the home appliances section of Don Quixote.

480
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Yes, yes.

481
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
That's part of it.

482
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:33,000
What happens when you play a CD in a DVD player?

483
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I've never done that before.

484
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
You've never done it before?

485
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Yes.

486
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Electrical products are very...

487
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
You think they're smart, don't you?

488
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Oh, electronic products.

489
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
You think electronic products are smart.

490
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
You think electronic products are smart.

491
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
You think electronic products are smart.

492
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
You're the only one who thinks that.

493
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I think electronic products are smart, but they're actually not that different from electronic products.

494
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
That's right.

495
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
It's more like a joke.

496
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,000
You can only apply things that have been decided.

497
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I see.

498
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:10,000
That's why DVD players always decide when they put in DVD software.

499
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I see.

500
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
This is stupid.

501
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
If you put in a CD...

502
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Yes, yes.

503
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
If you put in a CD, they don't notice.

504
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
They don't know what they're putting in.

505
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:30,000
If you look at it for about 10 minutes, it goes into the TV screen.

506
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
It goes like this.

507
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,000
And then it goes red.

508
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
It goes like this.

509
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
They're stupid.

510
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Wait, wait.

511
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
What?

512
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Shut up.

513
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Turn on the button, turn on the button.

514
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Hama-chan, a super-duper, is often told that he has never done anything good for anyone except for the rich.

515
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Is that true?

516
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I'm sure that Mr. Matsumoto, who has been in Konpyo for many years, knows what good things Mr. Hamada has done for others.

517
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I'm sure that Mr. Matsumoto, who has been in Konpyo for many years, knows what good things Mr. Hamada has done for others.

518
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I see.

519
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Please tell me.

520
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Yes, yes.

521
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Can I think about it for a moment?

522
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Why?

523
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I was wondering what it was like.

524
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Don't think about it. Just remember it.

525
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Oh, I see.

526
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
I think there are a few.

527
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I don't think there are.

528
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Please tell me.

529
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:56,000
It looks good.

530
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Please wait a little longer.

531
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Matsun.

532
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,000
What's this, Matsun?

533
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Wait a minute.

534
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Matsun, please tell me what came over you.

535
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I think.

536
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Matsu! I don't get it! Ask Taka-chan!

537
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
No, no, I was just about to go out, in the park or something

538
00:19:42,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Matsu!

539
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Yes, yes

540
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Say it!

541
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,000
I was just about to go out, in the park or something

542
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Wait a minute

543
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,000
If you're late, you're late!

544
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Okay, okay, okay

545
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,000
If you go out, you're just like poop

546
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
If you go out, you're just like drool

547
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:33,000
If you think about it, it's hard to imagine

548
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Something happened, right?

549
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
I don't get it

550
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Can't Taka-san teach me?

551
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Hey, Taka-chan

552
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Taka-chan

553
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Taka-chan

554
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Matsu is in trouble!

555
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Hurry up and say it!

556
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I was just about to go out

557
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Say it!

558
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
If you say one more, I'll go home!

559
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
That, that, that, that, that, that, that

560
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
What is it?

561
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:16,000
That's a one-time thing

562
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
That's a one-time thing

563
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
In the end, that's a one-time thing

564
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Hey, Matsu

565
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
I don't get it

566
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
You said it's a one-time thing

567
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Say it! Just one more, you idiot

568
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:37,000
That's a one-time thing

569
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,000
It doesn't matter

570
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,000
It doesn't matter

571
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:50,000
That's a one-time thing

572
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,000
That's rude

573
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Hey, you

574
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,000
You took 18 aliens with you

575
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:12,000
How can you say that so casually?

576
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
It's been 21 years since we met

577
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
I've seen a lot of things

578
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Say it! You did something good once

579
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:25,000
That's a one-time thing

580
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:31,000
If you say it so suddenly, I don't get it

581
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:37,000
That's a one-time thing

582
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Please

583
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Why are you so irritated?

584
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
I'm thinking

585
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
You're thinking?

586
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

587
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
You can't lie

588
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
You can't lie

589
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:06,000
You can't lie

590
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,000
You can't lie

591
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:22,000
I've never seen anything like this
