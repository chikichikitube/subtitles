Is it like this?

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
It's like this

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
It has to be inside this frame

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
After that, as a punishment game

00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
The one who loses will have to write on his face

It's like this

This is the 5th round

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
It's a wonderful prize

21
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I don't need anything

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Gaki no Tsukai ga Arai Nde

00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000

Let's go

25
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The one who gets the cordless phone

26
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Don't come out

27
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm going

28
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
If you come out even a little

29
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I have to give you a gold ball

30
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Can I get a gold coin?

31
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The one who loses will have to write on his face

32
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
You don't do it

33
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
If you come out

34
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
It's your fault

35
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm tired

36
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
It hurts

37
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The third prize is a game

38
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:42,000
It's dangerous

39
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
It hurts

40
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Let's go

41
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Let's go to the second round

42
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I'll accept it

43
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Let's go to the second round

44
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Let's go to the second round

45
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Let's go to the second round

46
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I don't like it

47
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
It hurts

48
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
It's no good

49
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
What's the punishment?

50
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
The one who loses will have to write on his face

51
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
The one who loses will have to write on his face

52
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Buy 10 ice coffee

53
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Wait

54
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Buy 10 ice coffee

55
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I don't know

56
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
What is ice coffee?

57
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
It's canned coffee

58
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,000
It's 110 yen now

59
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Thank you

60
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Sorry

61
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
It's not me

62
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
The third prize is

63
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
What does it mean?

64
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
You can't go to the middle

65
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Here?

66
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I can go

67
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I think I can go

68
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
It's dangerous

69
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:18,000
The fourth prize is

70
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
It's no good

71
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Why are you laughing?

72
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Why are you laughing?

73
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
It stinks

74
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
It stinks

75
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
It stinks

76
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
It stinks

77
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
It stinks

78
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
It stinks

79
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Let's go to the next one

80
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Let's go to the next one

81
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
It still stinks

82
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
It smells like a gorilla

83
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I think I can go

84
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Go

85
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
It's close

86
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I don't know

87
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I don't know

88
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I don't want to go

89
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
The last one

90
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
The last prize is

91
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
If it's a diamond, will you edit it?

92
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I want to say that at the meeting

93
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I want to say that at the meeting

94
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
It's close

95
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
It's bent

96
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
It is not dirty

97
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Please do it

98
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
What are you doing?

99
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
What?

100
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
It's a car!

101
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Hey, hey!

102
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
What?

103
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
You shouldn't ride it!

104
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
No, the ceiling...

105
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
No, the ceiling is fine!

106
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I'll just ignore the ceiling.

107
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I've never done this before, so I don't know what to do.

108
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Huh?

109
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
What?

110
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Who's riding it?

111
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I'm not riding it!

112
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Ladies and gentlemen.

113
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Hello.

114
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Well...

115
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Hello.

116
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Well...

117
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Let's go.

118
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Well...

119
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Your fans are here again.

120
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Well...

121
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I love you.

122
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Is that so?

123
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I don't love you at all.

124
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
That's not how it works in the world.

125
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
That's not how it works in the world.

126
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
That's not how it works in the world.

127
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
You still look like you're going to say something.

128
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I've been looking at you for a while now.

129
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
You're wearing a collar like this?

130
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
That's fine.

131
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
No, it's not like that.

132
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
You know what?

133
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
No, no.

134
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
She's my fan.

135
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
That hurts.

136
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
So I'm going to hurt her a little bit.

137
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
This is something that's allowed.

138
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
You can't say that.

139
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
But it's this kind of clothes.

140
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
It's cute.

141
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
It's not cute at all.

142
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
So even if I had a role,

143
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I'm supposed to tell a lot of people.

144
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
But...

145
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
That's not true.

146
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
You don't tell people when they're stupid.

147
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I'm already stupid for wearing this kind of clothes.

148
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
To an amateur.

149
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
If you're a weak-minded person,

150
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
you'll be depressed.

151
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I've been watching the show.

152
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I'm going to write a letter.

153
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I'm going to write a letter.

154
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I'm going to go see the mirror.

155
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I'm going to wear a collar.

156
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I'm going to open the door.

157
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I'm going to open the door.

158
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I thought it was this.

159
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I thought it was this.

160
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
That's what the talent said.

161
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
What are you saying?

162
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I was told that.

163
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I'm going to go see the mirror.

164
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
So.

165
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Stop shaking when you see the mirror.

166
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
There's still a different outfit.

167
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
It depends on the person.

168
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
You can't do this.

169
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Hello, Kei-chan.

170
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
How was the show today?

171
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Did you have fun?

172
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
What are you drinking?

173
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Stop it.

174
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Don't drink sleeping pills like this.

175
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Stop it.

176
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Don't say such harsh things to an amateur.

177
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I'm not.

178
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I'm laughing.

179
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
That's good, isn't it?

180
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Hey.

181
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,000
That may be the moment when the candles go out.

182
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
It's okay.

183
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Why are you laughing so much?

184
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Stop it.

185
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
So.

186
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
That's it.

187
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
What is it?

188
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Well.

189
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Don't say such things.

190
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Let's do the show.

191
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Again.

192
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
It's a story.

193
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I want to do this show soon.

194
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Is that so?

195
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I'm thinking about it.

196
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
With Gyo-san again?

197
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
With Gyo-san.

198
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
You've been doing it all night, haven't you?

199
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Sometimes.

200
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Yes.

201
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I haven't done it once since this time.

202
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
If you say so.

203
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Is that so?

204
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Yes.

205
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I want to do something.

206
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Yes.

207
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I wonder how many people will come.

208
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Yes.

209
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I'm doing it once.

210
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Have you decided the number of people so far?

211
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I've decided.

212
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
1,000 people.

213
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Yes.

214
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
It's a time that even people with school can come.

215
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Yes.

216
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
You're annoying.

217
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Why are you doing this?

218
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I'm not feeling well.

219
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I have a lot of phlegm.

220
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
And.

221
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I have a lot of dandruff.

222
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
You're about to die.

223
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
When cats are about to die.

224
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I have a lot of dandruff.

225
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Is that so?

226
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
You're going to die.

227
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I don't want to be away from people.

228
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
You're going to die.

229
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
You're going to die.

230
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Cats die somewhere.

231
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Somewhere I don't know.

232
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I have a lot of dandruff in the middle.

233
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
It's terrible.

234
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I want to be away from people.

235
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I think I'm going to die.

236
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I don't know how I'm going to die.

237
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Hey.

238
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I think I'm going to die.

239
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Everyone thinks I'm laughing.

240
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I don't know how I'm going to die.

241
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I don't know how I'm going to die.

242
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
If you open it, it's going to come out like this.

243
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I'm scared.

244
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
If you open it, it's going to come out like this.

245
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
What I'm often told is that I'm going to die in an accident in a car.

246
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
That's the coolest thing.

247
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Is there anything cool?

248
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I don't have such a beautiful face.

249
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I'm going to die with a beautiful face.

250
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I think I'm going to die with a smile and a calm face.

251
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I'm going to die in an accident in a second, but I can't laugh.

252
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I'm going to die in a second, but I can't laugh.

253
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I don't have anything to remember.

254
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:46,000
So no matter how big the accident is, when I open the crown.

255
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Are you still planning to die?

256
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I'm not planning anything.

257
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Your face is like a cherry blossom.

258
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
It's a calm face.

259
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Let's break it again.

260
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I'm going to open the crown.

261
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Look, look, look.

262
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Your eyes are open.

263
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:06,000
My eyes are open.

264
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I'm scared.

265
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
What kind of face is that?

266
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I have a calm face.

267
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
A calm face?

268
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I have an angel-like face.

269
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Look at it.

270
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Look at it.

271
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
No, no, no.

272
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
It's different.

273
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
What?

274
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
It's no good.

275
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
If you have such eyes.

276
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I have a boy-like eyes.

277
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
That's no good.

278
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I'm not dead.

279
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
You're not dead either.

280
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
No, no, no.

281
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
No, no, no.

282
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I don't care about that story.

283
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
What is it?

284
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Well, I'm not a prophet.

285
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I'm planning.

286
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Why are you talking about planning?

287
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I'm going to gather a lot of people and see what to do.

288
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I see.

289
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
What about the place?

290
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
What are you going to do next?

291
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I'm going to gather unlimitedly.

292
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I don't know how many people will come.

293
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I don't know how many people will come.

294
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I'm going to go to a pretty big place next time.

295
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
That's right.

296
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
What are you going to do?

297
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Gather a lot of people.

298
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:13,000
What can you do with a lot of people?

299
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I don't know what you're going to do next time.

300
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
There was the opinion that you would gather a lot of people and join hands with them.

301
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I'm going to bring it.

302
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
What are you going to do?

303
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I don't know if I'm going to bring it.

304
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I don't know if I'm going to bring it.

305
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I don't know if I'm going to bring it.

306
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
What do you do with a lot of people?

307
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Do you want to do a concert?

308
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Hello, Bachchan, Hama-chan.

309
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Good evening.

310
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:56,000
There was an interesting song in the middle school student songbook, so please take a look.

311
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Kanon, Kanon.

312
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
It has a very good meaning.

313
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I see.

314
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
The fly came, the fly came.

315
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Crush it before you get stabbed.

316
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
The sky has come again.

317
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
The fly came.

318
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
This is a tough scene, isn't it?

319
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Probably, the fly came, the fly came.

320
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Crush it before you get stabbed.

321
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
The sky has come again.

322
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
The fly came.

323
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
It's a very pop feeling, isn't it?

324
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
It has a very good meaning.

325
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I can understand the atmosphere.

326
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Can you sing it?

327
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Well...

328
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:36,000
The fly came...

329
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
You should be pop now.

330
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Kanon, you...

331
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
You are a fool.

332
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
You are a fool.

333
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
What?

334
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
The Hungarian Mion is like that.

335
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
At first, it gradually becomes pop.

336
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Don't say such a strange thing.

337
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I'll fly you from the beginning.

338
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,000
The fly came.

339
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,000
The fly came.

340
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Crush it before you get stabbed.

341
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:14,000
The sky has come again.

342
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
The Hungarian Mion is like that.

343
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
At first, it gradually becomes pop.

344
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Crush it before you get stabbed.

345
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:31,000
The fly came.

346
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
The sky has come again.

347
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
The fly came.

348
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
You should be pop now.

349
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
At first, it gradually becomes pop.

350
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:48,000
The fly came.

351
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:53,000
The fly came.

352
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Crush it before you get stabbed.

353
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,000
The sky has come again.

354
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
The sky has come again.

355
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
The sky has come again.

356
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
You are a princess, aren't you?

357
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Yes.

358
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
You are a princess, aren't you?

359
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Where did you get excited?

360
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
The fly came again.

361
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
You should be pop now.

362
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
It hurts.

363
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
You hurt me.

364
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Send me the song.

365
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
It doesn't matter if it's a record or tape.

366
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
It doesn't matter if it's a tape or tape.

367
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,000
If the whole world became yours, what would you do first?

368
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
This is a common story.

369
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:43,000
If all mankind were destroyed and you were the only one left.

370
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I don't think so.

371
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Why?

372
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
It's fun to be alone.

373
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
This is all yours.

374
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
It's all yours.

375
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
That's right.

376
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
You can park your car as much as you want.

377
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
It doesn't matter if it's a small thing.

378
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
You can drive with your feet.

379
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I can do it.

380
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
No one is talking to me.

381
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
No one is talking to you.

382
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I don't think you're on TV.

383
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
No one is talking to me.

384
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
You are on TV.

385
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
What?

386
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Are you watching me?

387
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I'm not watching you.

388
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
What kind of world do you want to conquer?

389
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I don't care what happens.

390
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
In your case,

391
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Don't you think so?

392
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
What?

393
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
What's going to happen?

394
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
No matter what kind of question you ask,

395
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
If your wish comes true,

396
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
If you can be a transparent person.

397
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
No matter what you say,

398
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
You only think about death.

399
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
A transparent person is a transparent person who can pass through the wall.

400
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
It's not like that.

401
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
It's just invisible.

402
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I see.

403
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
It's invisible, but it's hard to be a transparent person.

404
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
If you're a transparent person who can pass through the wall,

405
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
It's hard to be a transparent person.

406
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Why?

407
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Because it's transparent.

408
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I thought it felt good, so I thought I'd touch it.

409
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
But there's nothing.

410
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
You can't touch it.

411
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I can't.

412
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I don't have to worry about it.

413
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Why?

414
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
You have to think about this.

415
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
If you think about it,

416
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
You can pass through.

417
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
You can pass through.

418
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
It's okay.

419
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
It's okay to pass through.

420
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
It's okay at this time, but you can't wear clothes in winter.

421
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
It's not transparent as it is.

422
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
It's transparent.

423
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Then you're a transparent person.

424
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
It's transparent tie.

425
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
It's transparent.

426
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
It's okay if you disappear as it is.

427
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Then you have to wear clothes like this.

428
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
It's okay.

429
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
It's invisible.

430
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
It stinks.

431
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I can't see anything, but it stinks.

432
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
It stinks here.

433
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I can't break it.

434
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I can't break it.

435
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
You'll be found out.

436
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
He's here again.

437
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Who is he?

438
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
It's transparent.

439
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
It's hard.

440
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
It's transparent.

441
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
It's okay if you're a quiet person in winter.

442
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
How can I be quiet?

443
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I don't have an apartment.

444
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
You can go to someone's house.

445
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Even if I go to someone's house, I can't get in because the door isn't open.

446
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
That's why you should follow the person on the road.

447
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:26,000
I can't get in.

448
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:34,000
I can't close it so fast.

449
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
The door is open.

450
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
It's open like this.

451
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
I see.

452
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:46,000
It's open like this.

453
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
I can't do that.

454
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Even if you get it right, no one will know that it's transparent.

455
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
It's strange, when you enter a house.

456
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
So, it's not like that.

457
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
The whole world will be yours.

458
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
The whole world will be yours.

459
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Ah, then, I got it.

460
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Humanity will all perish.

461
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I don't like that.

462
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
So, you are left.

463
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
There's only one person left.

464
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Well, if that's the case, then that's the case.

465
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
I don't need a man.

466
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Why don't you need a man?

467
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Isn't that right?

468
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Isn't that right?

469
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Are you going to have a man?

470
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
A horse?

471
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Eh?

472
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
A horse?

473
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
What are you doing?

474
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Even more so.

475
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
The train doesn't run anymore.

476
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
The bus doesn't run either.

477
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
The cars don't run either.

478
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Humanity will all perish.

479
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
What are you going to do with a horse?

480
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
If that's the case, then that's the case.

481
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Ha!

482
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
What are you in a hurry for?

483
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
If you're the only one who doesn't perish,

484
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
then why don't you just die?

485
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
What is this?

486
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Why don't you walk slowly?

487
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Ha!
