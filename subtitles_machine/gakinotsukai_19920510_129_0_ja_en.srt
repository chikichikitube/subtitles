1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Please do not use the child.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Let's play together tonight.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Wait! Wait! Wait!

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Wait! Wait! Wait!

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Stop! Stop! Stop!

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
It's like this in the house!

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
It's like this in the house!

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:26,000
The first game is Tsukichi-Ganmen Ose-ro game with Gagi-no-tsu-kai-ara-en!

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
It's good to see you're so excited.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm so excited.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
You're such a fool.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Normally, there are four ways to play Ose-ro.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
From the beginning?

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Yes, from the beginning to the end.

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Let's decide the color one by one.

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Let's start from there.

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
You're black, I'm white.

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm black.

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Then I'll go from here.

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
The first game is Tsukichi-Ganmen Ose-ro game with Gagi-no-tsu-kai-ara-en!

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I'll go from here.

22
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'll go from the glasses to here.

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
You're black, I'm white.

24
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Then I'll go from the glasses to here.

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
You're black, I'm white.

26
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Then I'll go from here.

27
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I'll make Tsukichi-Ganmen black.

28
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Then I'll go from the head to here.

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
You're Otomo.

30
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Otomo, why are you so quiet?

31
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I'll go from the glasses to here.

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Then I'll go from the glasses to here.

33
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
You're so noisy.

34
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
If Yano goes like this...

35
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Motoyuki Takasu will be black.

36
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Sugano will be surprised.

37
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Then Yano will...

38
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Wait, wait, wait!

39
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Then Yamazaki and Suga will be black.

40
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Kanazaki!

41
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
If it goes like this...

42
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Like this?

43
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Suga-chan, you've changed a lot.

44
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Suga-chan, today's opening will be a great success.

45
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Leave your ears to the flow of time.

46
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I'll be dyed in your color.

47
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I'll go from the glasses to here.

48
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Then I'll go from the glasses to here.

49
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Then I'll go from the glasses to here.

50
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I'll go from the glasses to here.

51
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
It's a strange hall.

52
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
What?

53
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
It's a strange hall.

54
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
How many times have we been here?

55
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
It's the second time today.

56
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
It's a strange hall.

57
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
It's a strange hall.

58
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
It's cheap.

59
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
It's not about the price.

60
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
You've never been in a catecho before.

61
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I've never been in a catecho.

62
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I've never been in a catecho.

63
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
You've never been in a catecho.

64
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I've never been in a catecho.

65
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
There's an electric board on it.

66
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
There isn't.

67
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I saw it with my own eyes.

68
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
That's wrong.

69
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
That's a catecho.

70
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Wrong and catecho are completely different.

71
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
It's not right.

72
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
It's not right.

73
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Wrong catecho.

74
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
It's not right.

75
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
It's not right.

76
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I've never been in a catecho before.

77
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
It's not right.

78
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
It's a catecho.

79
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
It's not right.

80
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
It had been different.

81
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
It was heavy, wasn't it?

82
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
No, it's not like that at all.

83
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
It's not like that at all.

84
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
No, it's not like that at all.

85
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
What is that?

86
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Around here, the part of the neck is loose.

87
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
It's a shoulder.

88
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
No, it's not.

89
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
The numbers are different.

90
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Shoulders.

91
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
It's not at all.

92
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
It's a good shoulder.

93
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Are you stupid?

94
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
You are really...

95
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
It's not a shoulder. It's a complete Japanese word.

96
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
It's not a shoulder.

97
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
The shoulder of the shoulder is Kanji.

98
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
The shoulder is not a Katakana.

99
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
There is also a hiragana.

100
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I've never had a shoulder.

101
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I've never had a shoulder.

102
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
You've had a shoulder.

103
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
You're so stubborn.

104
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
The numbers are different.

105
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
The shoulder is hard.

106
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Your story is the number difference.

107
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
It's not at all.

108
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
There was a person on the Shinkansen.

109
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
There was a person on the Shinkansen.

110
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
He was wearing a hat and a face mask.

111
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
He was wearing a hat and a face mask.

112
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
He was sleeping.

113
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
The numbers are different.

114
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Do you know what?

115
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Ask me.

116
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
It was like this.

117
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I have a strong body.

118
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
How can you have a weak body?

119
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
It's a stupid story.

120
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Ask me.

121
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
It's a strong story.

122
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
It's a stupid story.

123
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I have a strong body.

124
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
It's a stupid story.

125
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
It's a strong story.

126
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
It's a strong story.

127
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
It's a strong story.

128
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
It's a strong story.

129
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Did you take a picture?

130
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Of course.

131
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I don't think it was taken.

132
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
The number of cameras is different.

133
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
What is he doing?

134
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I don't think it was taken.

135
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I think it's gone from the screen.

136
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I was able to catch it.

137
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Don't say stupid things.

138
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Jump again.

139
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Jump.

140
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
You jumped.

141
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I was able to catch it before the time was over.

142
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Thank you very much.

143
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
It was a bad time.

144
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
You jumped as hard as you could.

145
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I'm a strong man.

146
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
You have a great body.

147
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
You know, I'm 28 years old now.

148
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
But I'm still 17 years old physically.

149
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Are you an idiot?

150
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Are you an idiot?

151
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
No, I'm serious.

152
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
What are you talking about?

153
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I've never seen a sport where you lose.

154
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
You're not good at sports.

155
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Are you an idiot?

156
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Even if I run, it's like this.

157
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Are you an idiot?

158
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Are you an idiot?

159
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
The first secret of the year.

160
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
That's dirty.

161
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Let's keep it a secret.

162
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Why is it a secret?

163
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
You don't have to say it.

164
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Everyone loves Macchan.

165
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I love Macchan.

166
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Why do you say it twice?

167
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,000
There are a lot of people all over the country.

168
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
But the secret of the year.

169
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
The secret of the year.

170
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Don't say it twice.

171
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
The secret of the year.

172
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Suddenly, the secret of the year.

173
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:15,000
First of all, why can't you show your power in sports?

174
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Why do you think you're such a macho man?

175
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Where is it?

176
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I think everyone thinks so.

177
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Muscles are also moving a lot.

178
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
You're not good at sports.

179
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Why can't you do sports?

180
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
It's not that I can't do it.

181
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:49,000
To tell you the truth, my muscles are too big.

182
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:55,000
That's why I'm not good at sports.

183
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
What are you talking about?

184
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
If I tell you the truth, I won't lose.

185
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I don't think so.

186
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
No matter what you do.

187
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
You haven't done it.

188
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I can do it even though I haven't done it.

189
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
You haven't done it.

190
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I'm good at using my grip.

191
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Really?

192
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Yes.

193
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
What do you use grip for?

194
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Arm wrestling and finger wrestling.

195
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I don't have a table.

196
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I can do it here.

197
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
If you can't do it, you can't do it.

198
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I can't do it.

199
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Let's do it together.

200
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,000
It's been a long time since I saw a manly man.

201
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Are you crazy?

202
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Why don't you sit down and do it again?

203
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I can laugh here.

204
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Sit down quickly.

205
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Don't do it again.

206
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Who said this?

207
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Tell your brother.

208
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
My brother?

209
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
What are you doing?

210
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Like this.

211
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
The grip and arm wrestling are different.

212
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
You said it.

213
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
This is true.

214
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
The grip and arm wrestling are different.

215
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
But the power here is different.

216
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
It's okay if you use your fingers.

217
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
What fingers?

218
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
This.

219
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
You use your fingers.

220
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
What is this?

221
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
This is unexpected laughter.

222
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I thought about it twice.

223
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Should I hold my finger and do this?

224
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
This is not decided.

225
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
This is not decided.

226
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Let's do it again.

227
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
With what?

228
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
With something.

229
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Okay.

230
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Let's do it.

231
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
It's been a long time.

232
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I haven't done it since baseball.

233
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Did you play golf?

234
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I played golf before that.

235
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
What are you talking about?

236
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I played golf and baseball.

237
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I want to play a penalty game.

238
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
What is it?

239
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I want to play a penalty game.

240
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I want to get a frame.

241
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
5 minutes.

242
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I want to watch a comedy with you.

243
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
What is a comedy?

244
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I want to watch a comedy with you.

245
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I want to go out with you in the morning.

246
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I want to do a comedy with you for 5 minutes.

247
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Okay.

248
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I want to see it.

249
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Are you stupid?

250
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Are you stupid?

251
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Are you a team player?

252
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
It doesn't matter if it's a team.

253
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Let's do it as a team.

254
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Let's divide it in half.

255
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Let's do it as a team.

256
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:12,000
If you lose in a team, you will be in front of American kids.

257
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Do you really call Ashiko?

258
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
What if I lose?

259
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I want to play a penalty game with you.

260
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Will you come?

261
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I can't come if you call me.

262
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I'll think about it.

263
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I'll think about what to do.

264
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Shall we play rugby?

265
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I've never played rugby, so I don't know if it's fun.

266
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Let's try it.

267
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
If you lose, call your mother.

268
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I haven't decided yet.

269
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Penalty game.

270
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Let's do it.

271
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:54,000
It's going to be a mess, but you can grab it and run.

272
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
That's right.

273
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
It's more fun than sumo.

274
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Sumo is different.

275
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Let's show your ass.

276
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I won't show my ass.

277
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I don't know if you're used to showing your ass.

278
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,000
If I show my ass to everyone, I'll do it smoothly.

279
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Machan.

280
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Shall we do it?

281
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:27,000
What?

282
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I don't know how to relieve your stress.

283
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:36,000
If you show your ass, I'll do it smoothly.

284
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Machan said that he drew it when he was looking at his uncle's back.

285
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I tried it, too.

286
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I was looking at my nose.

287
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:51,000
It's weird to see it from the front, so I looked at it from the side about three meters away.

288
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I think it's a child.

289
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Then I drew a nose and then I put it in my mouth.

290
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Then I said,

291
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Eat it.

292
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Eat it.

293
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Why don't you say it twice?

294
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
You didn't draw it twice, did you?

295
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
It's a lie, but it's true.

296
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
If it's Machan, he'll believe me.

297
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
This is a great story.

298
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
It's amazing that you ate it.

299
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
What?

300
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
It's more than that.

301
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
First of all, I bought it.

302
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:37,000
If you say you bought it when you see it, it's over.

303
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I'm sure she's more than she thinks.

304
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
You're an expert.

305
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
No, I'm not.

306
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
It's more like a peck than a cactus.

307
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
What are you talking about?

308
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
That's right.

309
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Cactus is an extracurricular thing, isn't it?

310
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Extracurricular?

311
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Isn't it extracurricular?

312
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Extracurricular?

313
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Isn't it just a bowl?

314
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
A bowl?

315
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
It's a peck, so it's an intracurricular thing.

316
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
What are you talking about?

317
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
It's human instinct to put it in your mouth.

318
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Is that so?

319
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
It's the same with an eraser, isn't it?

320
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,000
If you smell something, you'll go like this.

321
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I don't breathe when I smell it.

322
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I sometimes go like this with that softness.

323
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
That's human instinct.

324
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Human instinct is to put something in your mouth right away.

325
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Something that makes you feel good.

326
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I know that.

327
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:38,000
You put it in your mouth right away.

328
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
It doesn't have to be dirty.

329
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I want to eat it.

330
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
You think it's human, don't you?

331
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Have you ever eaten a cactus?

332
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
What?

333
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
No, it's dirty.

334
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
It's even dirtier.

335
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:03,000
You put it in your mouth, don't you?

336
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Laugh a little more.

337
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I'm going to the shrine right now.

338
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I'm curious about my dad who's sitting in the bandai.

339
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:18,000
When I take off my clothes, I look at the bandai and my eyes meet.

340
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
The other day, he smiled at me.

341
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,000
And last night, my underwear was gone from the basket.

342
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:31,000
This is the only way to make my dad feel better.

343
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
What do you mean?

344
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:40,000
It's a strange bandai, isn't it?

345
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Is that legal?

346
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
It's there.

347
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
It's there.

348
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
For example, if you're an old man, you can't see women's clothes.

349
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Is that okay?

350
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
That's right.

351
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
You can see everything.

352
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
You can see my underwear, too.

353
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Your underwear?

354
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Wow!

355
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,000
But you can see things you don't see.

356
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
It could be zero.

357
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
It could be negative.

358
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
It could be negative.

359
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
You can see things you don't usually see.

360
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
That's right.

361
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
It's amazing, isn't it?

362
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,000
You can see things you don't see.

363
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:24,000
You think, wow, but you think, wow, again.

364
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:32,000
You know, a 70-year-old old woman has a great body.

365
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
You can show it off.

366
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
It's not a V-shape.

367
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
It's like this.

368
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Once, like this.

369
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
What is it?

370
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
It's a square.

371
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
It's because you were born.

372
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Where did you see that?

373
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
No, no, I've seen it.

374
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
When?

375
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I haven't even been to a bathhouse.

376
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
It's like this.

377
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
It's like this.

378
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:04,000
It's like a demon in the corner of hell.

379
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
There are dozens of them.

380
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
It's amazing, isn't it?

381
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
It's tough, isn't it?

382
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
It's tough.

383
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
What should I do with this?

384
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
There's a homo bandai.

385
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,000
There are two kinds of homo.

386
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
There are.

387
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Brother and brother.

388
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Brother and brother.

389
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
What is a brother?

390
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Brother is the one who takes care of you.

391
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Brother is alive.

392
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Brother is alive.

393
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Brother is taken care of.

394
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
It hurts.

395
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Brother is taken care of.

396
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
It's a strange world.

397
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Brother comes from behind.

398
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Brother comes from behind.

399
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
But brother is excited.

400
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Brother is taking care of you at that time.

401
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Brother is taking care of you at that time.

402
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
It's a strange story, isn't it?

403
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
It's a strange story.

404
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
It hurts.

405
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
It hurts.

406
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
It hurts, but it stands.

407
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
It stands.

408
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
It's even possible for a brother to come in front of it.

409
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
It's possible.

410
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,000
And again, brother, brother, brother.

411
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,000
It's possible for it to be like Jutsu.

412
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
It's connected.

413
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,000
So I have no choice but to take it so that it will be hated.

414
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I bought a pair of panties.

415
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
I'm going to take off my panties.

416
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,000
I think it's best to think about these panties a little more.

417
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I don't want to take them off again.

418
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I think it's best.

419
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Even men want to take off their panties when they see a beautiful girl.

420
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
I don't know much about it.

421
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Shut up.

422
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,000
I just want to be with you.

423
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:52,000
That's because you looked down on me during the day.

424
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Let's take it off.

425
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,000
No, it's like this.

426
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
What kind of feeling is it?

427
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Well, rugby.

428
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Yes.

429
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Let's do our best as a rugby.

430
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
It's noisy.

431
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
It's okay. Let's do our best.

432
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Really.

433
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Let's do it.

434
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
It's been a long time.

435
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
It's been a long time.

436
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Well, the season is good.

437
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
It's getting warmer.

438
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
It's getting warmer.

439
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
It's getting nice.

440
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Look at the weather.

441
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
It's like a bust in the summer.

442
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Yes.

443
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,000
In the summer, there are a lot of crimes in the country.

444
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
There are also kidnappings.

445
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
A kidnapper took a little boy and called the kidnapper.

446
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Hello.

447
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Oh, you scared me!

448
00:21:52,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Oh, you scared me!
