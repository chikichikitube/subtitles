1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
What should we do?

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Endo vs. Kato vs. Taka.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I want to watch this too. Moriman vs. Heipo.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
With Heipo?

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Yes.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I want to watch it.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I don't think I'll be able to do it.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
What do you mean?

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
The main character is...

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The famous one.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Yes.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Should we give the name of Yama-chan's child?

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Seriously.

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Seriously?

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
For example?

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Desperado.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
That's good.

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I think it's decided.

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Yama-san.

20
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Yama-san?

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Desperado.

22
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I think it's really good.

23
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Desperado is Des-chan.

24
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Desu-chan is Desu-chan.

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Desu-chan is Desu-chan.

26
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Desu-chan is Desu-chan.

27
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Desu-chan is Desu-chan.

28
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Here you go.

29
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Hello.

30
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
You laughed.

31
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
The last line was a bit off.

32
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
You didn't talk at all.

33
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Here you go.

34
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
You said, here you go.

35
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I want to go to Hawaii.

36
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Hawaii.

37
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Wait a minute.

38
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Wait a minute.

39
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
What is it?

40
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Why didn't you tell me?

41
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
That your family was coming.

42
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
It was only for a day.

43
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I thought it would be okay if I didn't tell you.

44
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
You're like a fool.

45
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I'm going home tonight.

46
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
It's okay.

47
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Shake your hand where you are with your family on the pool side.

48
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
If you shake your hand, you won't be shaken.

49
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I'm not a fool.

50
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
It's okay.

51
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
It's okay.

52
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
It's okay.

53
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Let's go.

54
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Tomorrow.

55
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Let's go to the pool again tomorrow.

56
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
He's a fool.

57
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,000
He's shaving his bones.

58
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
He has a beard.

59
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I don't know what to comment on.

60
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I saw that video.

61
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Thank you.

62
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Thank you.

63
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Thank you.

64
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Thank you.

65
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
You said you were 85 years old the other day.

66
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
You are single.

67
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Please take me to the pool again.

68
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Thank you.

69
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Congratulations.

70
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Thank you.

71
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
You are a fool.

72
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
You are a fool.

73
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
You are a fool.

74
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Did you do that?

75
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
No.

76
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I'm having fun today.

77
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I'm having fun today.

78
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I'm having fun today.

79
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,000
What's wrong?

80
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Put it in your mouth.

81
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
You are a fool.

82
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
You are a fool.

83
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
What's wrong?

84
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:18,000
You are a fool.

85
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
What's wrong?

86
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
What's wrong?

87
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
What's wrong?

88
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
What's wrong?

89
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:40,000
You are hiding your face.

90
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
What's wrong?

91
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
You are hiding your face.

92
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
You are a fool.

93
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:55,000
You are hiding your face.

94
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I can't hear you at all.

95
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I can't hear you at all.

96
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Are you a pervert?

97
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Yes, I am.

98
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
You are a pervert.

99
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
You are a pervert.

100
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:25,000
You are a pervert.

101
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Red Light.

102
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,420
You threw that away.

103
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:50,000
How dare you?

104
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,720
I thought it was a lounger's guitar.

105
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:56,580
You did not organize my face at a Odaku later.

106
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:58,580
I don't like prophesying.

107
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:01,000
I didn't intend to do it so much when I wrote the book.

108
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
But Takasu Ishii, you did it without a Mission.

109
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
He let me keep imitating him.

110
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Takasu's lie.

111
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Endo was fooled too.

112
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I was fooled.

113
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Endo...

114
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Endo and Dynamite Shikoku.

115
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Endo...

116
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Endo and Dynamite Shikoku.

117
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Yes, this is Uchida Yume.

118
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
What, you're not in Rikiya?

119
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
You can't go tomorrow? Why?

120
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
It can't be helped then. Got it.

121
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Hello, this is Uchida who is making a reservation for tomorrow.

122
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I can't go alone, so please take care of the three of us.

123
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
This is Uchida Yume.

124
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
What, you're not in Rikiya?

125
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
You can't go after all?

126
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I've already made a phone call.

127
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
It can't be helped then.

128
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Let's go.

129
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
He's kind.

130
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Hello, this is Uchida.

131
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I'm going with the four of us after all.

132
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,000
You're making a reservation yourself?

133
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
That was funny.

134
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
What's wrong?

135
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
What's wrong?

136
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Thank goodness.

137
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
It's 6 o'clock.

138
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I should go home.

139
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I can go home.

140
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I should go home.

141
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
What's this?

142
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
It's 5 o'clock.

143
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
What's this?

144
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
It's 5 o'clock.

145
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
This is the worst.

146
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I should go home.

147
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Yamasaki.

148
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
It's over.

149
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
It's 27,000 yen.

150
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
That's amazing.

151
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
27,000 yen means that he's in third place.

152
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
He's in fourth place.

153
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Fourth place.

154
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Miyasakuri, 1,000 yen up.
