00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:26,000
This program is brought to you by the following sponsors.

2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I now pronounce the verdict.

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Please enter the courtroom.

4
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Now, the defendant, please enter.

5
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:58,000
The defendant, Tatsuo Uemiyo, has been convicted.

6
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Now, the judge, Tatsuo Uemiyo, will begin his trial.

7
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
The defendant will defend against the defendant, so please enter the courtroom.

8
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Uemiyo, I'm going to expose you today!

9
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Don't think you can get away with this!

10
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Judge!

11
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Yes?

12
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Regarding this trial, I'm going to give you some evidence.

13
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I'm going to call a teacher.

14
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Are you ready?

15
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Yes.

16
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Teacher!

17
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Uemiyo Tatsuya

18
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
That guy is from Zura!

19
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Teacher!

20
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Yes?

21
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Teacher Raskun!

22
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Yes, yes.

23
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I understand.

24
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I've looked into a lot of things.

25
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Yes.

26
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I've seen a lot of evidence.

27
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
First, I'd like you to look at the evidence photo.

28
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Please show it to me.

29
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Yes, please show it to me.

30
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:12,000
If you look at this, you can see that Uemiyo Tatsuya's iron-cutter is loose.

31
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I see.

32
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
As expected of Uemiyo Tatsuya.

33
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
If you don't say a word, does that mean you're angry?

34
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Well, well, teacher.

35
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
This isn't it.

36
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Oh, it's not it?

37
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
You're the one who made me angry, you bastard!

38
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I got this Uemiyo Tatsuya's favorite brush from the dressing room.

39
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I see.

40
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
This is it.

41
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
That's a lot of hair.

42
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I took one of these and enlarged it scientifically.

43
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
This is the photo.

44
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Oh!

45
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
100% nylon!

46
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
We were surprised.

47
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
We were surprised.

48
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
We were surprised.

49
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
First, let's look at this.

50
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
This is it.

51
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I wonder when this photo was taken.

52
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I wonder when this photo was taken.

53
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Uemiyo, when was this photo taken?

54
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
No matter how many years ago, it hasn't changed at all, has it?

55
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Well, well, well, that's what you say.

56
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
What's the difference?

57
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I'd like you to focus on this area.

58
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
The area between the cheeks and ears.

59
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I moved the camera further.

60
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
You moved the camera further.

61
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Yes, yes.

62
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
This is what it looks like.

63
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Well, well, well, that's fine.

64
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
We don't know yet.

65
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
When I moved the camera further, I found something amazing.

66
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I see.

67
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Bang!

68
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
A string!

69
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
What?

70
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
It's a string, isn't it?

71
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
It's tied up like this!

72
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
It doesn't have a string attached to it today.

73
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Well, it's for TV.

74
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I see.

75
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
And I also got a picture of your usual relaxed appearance.

76
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I'm going to laugh at this.

77
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Yes.

78
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
This is before the show!

79
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Do I have to wear that?

80
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
You're wearing it now!

81
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Next.

82
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Yes.

83
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
It's a picture of the TV.

84
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
His face isn't smiling.

85
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
What?

86
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
He's wearing it!

87
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
He's wearing it!

88
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
He's wearing it!

89
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
It's a string!

90
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I hit him once before the show.

91
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,000
When he was hit by a wire, he made a sound like this.

92
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I see.

93
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
It's because of the string that the iron plate on the back is broken.

94
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Bring me the wire.

95
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I don't need it anymore!

96
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I'm going to hit the professor's head.

97
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I see.

98
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
There's another proof video.

99
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Can I watch it?

100
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Yes.

101
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:17,000
This is the doll in front of the Umeda station.

102
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Yes.

103
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
This is the 10th floor.

104
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Yes, it's the 22nd floor.

105
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Is this the doll island?

106
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Yes, it is.

107
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Next.

108
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Shut up!

109
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
This is the doll that looks exactly like Tatsu Umeda.

110
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
That's right.

111
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,000
It means that the doll is the same as Tatsu Umeda.

112
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I see.

113
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
This is what it looks like when it's hidden.

114
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Can you bring me the proof video?

115
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Yes.

116
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
This is it.

117
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
If you pass by Harajuku, please take a picture of it.

118
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
This is what it looks like.

119
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Mr. Daibashi!

120
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
The doll is running wild.

121
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Congratulations.

122
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
This is what it looks like.

123
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
If he's hiding,

124
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,000
he might think that his friends and acquaintances know about it.

125
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I see.

126
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
He's very close to him.

127
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I'm talking to this person.

128
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I see.

129
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I don't want to say this because it might affect my friendship.

130
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
But I have to tell you the truth.

131
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
This is Katsura.

132
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
The basis of the name Katsura is that

133
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
when he was young, he had a razor.

134
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
When I saw it in the dressing room, I wondered what it was.

135
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I thought it was a razor with a razor.

136
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
But it wasn't.

137
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
He used both of them.

138
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
He doesn't seem to like Haga Kenji.

139
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
The reason why he doesn't like him is because

140
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Haga Kenji's hair is fluffier than human hair.

141
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
That's the only reason why Katsura likes him.

142
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Well, that's one reason.

143
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
His friend is also a razor.

144
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Are you saying it clearly?

145
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
His friend is saying it.

146
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
There's a secret room in Umemiya.

147
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
A reporter is there.

148
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
He's peeking into the dressing room.

149
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I don't know what's going to come out.

150
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Let's go.

151
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
This is in front of Umemiya Tatsuo's dressing room.

152
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Umemiya was here earlier.

153
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I'd like to come in while he's away.

154
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Hair.

155
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
What? Hair?

156
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Hair.

157
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Oh, okay.

158
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I'm sorry.

159
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
You're eating your lunch.

160
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
It's because it's Shura.

161
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Oh, I see.

162
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Look at this.

163
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,000
There's more hair on the desk than you need.

164
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
There's something else.

165
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
The one in the back.

166
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Yes.

167
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
What's that?

168
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
It's like a jewelry case.

169
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
This one?

170
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Yes.

171
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Can I open it without permission?

172
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
It's okay.

173
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
He's here.

174
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
It's weird to have a jewelry case for work.

175
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Please take a good look at it.

176
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
It's not that heavy.

177
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
It's not heavy?

178
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Yes.

179
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I'll open it.

180
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,000
It's Zura!

181
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,000
We have a variety show.

182
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
We have a variety show.

183
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Now, finally.

184
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
We need to do this.

185
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
We've developed a special chart-based diagnosis system.

186
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Let's do that.

187
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Let's go.

188
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
This is the first one.

189
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
His wife is a foreigner.

190
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Which one?

191
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Yes.

192
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Here it is.

193
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Do you think your daughter Anna is cute?

194
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Yes!

195
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
That's a yes!

196
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
In the past, she appeared in the movie, The Uncanny Battle.

197
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Which one?

198
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Yes!

199
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
That's a yes!

200
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
That's it!

201
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
That's it!

202
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Thank you very much!

203
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Now, the defendant, please come to the center.

204
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Judge, please make a decision based on what you just saw.

205
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Now, I will give you the verdict on the defendant, Tatsuya Uemia.

206
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
The verdict is...

207
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Death sentence!

208
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
What?

209
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
What do you mean, death sentence?

210
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
What do you mean, death sentence?

211
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Death sentence!

212
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
About three days ago, we had a 24-hour talk.

213
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Yes, we did.

214
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
We just did it.

215
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
And then you came out here and told me to talk.

216
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
What are you talking about?

217
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

218
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Wow, you're an IB.

219
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
You're talking about the past again.

220
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
But you know, I was surprised.

221
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
About what?

222
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
We had a 24-hour talk, and I was so tired.

223
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Yes.

224
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I almost died.

225
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
That's true.

226
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I thought I was going to die.

227
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
It must have been hard.

228
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I went home and slept like a pig.

229
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
The next day, you said you were bowling in the afternoon.

230
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Are you an idiot?

231
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I went to Hakone for a different show.

232
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Yes, yes, you did.

233
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
To shoot the ending.

234
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I joined the show in the evening.

235
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
You joined the show in the evening, didn't you?

236
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
That's the limit.

237
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Maybe I should have taken a break.

238
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Before that, everyone was in a bowling tournament.

239
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
So I thought I shouldn't go.

240
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I played about three games.

241
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
What? Are you a singer?

242
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Where are you?

243
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I don't know because I haven't been in the show for 24 hours.

244
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
But now I feel fresh.

245
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I feel like I'm in downtown.

246
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Two hours, three hours, four hours, five hours.

247
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I'm an old man.

248
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I didn't see it before, but I was doing my best.

249
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I was tired.

250
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
That's right.

251
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
You're looking at me from the beginning.

252
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
In the middle of the night, you gave out curry at dinner time, didn't you?

253
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
When it was about that time, I was tired of looking at it.

254
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I was tired of looking at it.

255
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I said, line up.

256
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I gave out curry.

257
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
There was this person in front of me.

258
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I looked at the curry.

259
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
You're usually like this.

260
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I can't get used to it.

261
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I thought I'd look at it a little bit when I went to the curry shop.

262
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I look at it from the back.

263
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I've been with you for a long time.

264
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I've been with you for a long time.

265
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I don't see your face.

266
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Because it's creepy.

267
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
We're both.

268
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I've been looking at your face for 24 hours.

269
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I feel bad.

270
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
It's true.

271
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Wait.

272
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I've been tired for 24 hours.

273
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I'm going to sleep in the car.

274
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Your face comes out.

275
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
It's creepy.

276
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
That face came out, too.

277
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I fell down like this.

278
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
It's creepy.

279
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
What's wrong with you?

280
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
There's a lot of people today.

281
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I'm glad you came.

282
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Why are you sitting in the back?

283
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I don't know.

284
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
You came and didn't say,

285
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Kato Shimura.

286
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Who's Kato?

287
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Who's Shimura?

288
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
You didn't say, Shimura, back, back.

289
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I'm not angry.

290
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Shimura, back, back.

291
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
What are you doing now?

292
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I don't know if you're a director or something.

293
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I don't think so.

294
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Let's go home.

295
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
It's creepy.

296
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Did you sleep?

297
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I came home on Sunday.

298
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I slept for five or six hours.

299
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I played bowling.

300
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I played golf the next day.

301
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Why?

302
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I can't stand it.

303
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Wait a minute.

304
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
What do you mean you can't stand it?

305
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I want to live.

306
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Do you want to live?

307
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I don't usually sleep.

308
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Do you want to live?

309
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Do you want to live?

310
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I want to live.

311
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I want to see a lot of things.

312
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I want to see.

313
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I want to eat a lot of things.

314
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I want to ask.

315
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I want to lick.

316
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
There are a lot of things I want to lick.

317
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I can only lick one.

318
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I want to lick it.

319
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Are you a chef?

320
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Are you a chef?

321
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
You can't sleep for more than eight hours.

322
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
You'll get a headache.

323
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Isn't that true?

324
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Not at all.

325
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
After I finished, I slept in the car for three hours.

326
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I went home and went to bed at 12 o'clock.

327
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I slept until six o'clock.

328
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I slept for nine hours.

329
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I woke up for about an hour and ate.

330
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I went to bed at seven o'clock.

331
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,000
When I woke up, it was five o'clock.

332
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Do you get a headache?

333
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Not at all.

334
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
I've never slept for 23 hours.

335
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
If you sleep so much, you'll wake up in the middle of the night.

336
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I didn't wake up once.

337
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
No.

338
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I can't remember.

339
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,000
But you woke up in the middle of the night and ate.

340
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
That's true love.

341
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I didn't wake up for 23 hours.

342
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
If I didn't wake up, I would have slept too much.

343
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
What do you mean?

344
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I only sleep alone.

345
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Is that so?

346
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Yes.

347
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I feel bad when I sleep with you.

348
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Why?

349
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Because I sleep with my eyes open.

350
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I was told that I would wake up the love of 100 years.

351
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
With your eyes open?

352
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I sleep like this.

353
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I sleep like this.

354
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I'm sure I'll be a thief.

355
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I'll wake you up.

356
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I'll be a great security guard.

357
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I feel like I'm wearing a buckle.

358
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I'm serious.

359
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I slept for 23 hours.

360
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Is that so?

361
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I'm sorry.

362
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I didn't wake up.

363
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
You slept again, didn't you?

364
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I slept for a long time.

365
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I slept for a long time.

366
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I slept with my left hand.

367
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I don't remember.

368
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I don't remember.

369
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I slept.

370
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
You should exercise.

371
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
You slept with your left hand.

372
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
But you're fine.

373
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I guess you don't live long.

374
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Is that so?

375
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Yes.

376
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
You can't sleep like that.

377
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
You can't catch up with anyone.

378
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Who?

379
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
That's why you haven't recovered.

380
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
You're still tired.

381
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Don't turn your ankle.

382
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
This?

383
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
No, no, no.

384
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
This?

385
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
No, no, no.

386
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Why is there a board on the kamaboko?

387
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
You can tell by the way it's made.

388
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
The board on the kamaboko is recent.

389
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
It's been four or five years.

390
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
That's not true.

391
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
It's true.

392
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
It didn't have a board before that.

393
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
That's not true.

394
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
You used to work with a kamaboko board, didn't you?

395
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
No, no, no.

396
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
That's not true.

397
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I used to work with a kamaboko board.

398
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
That's four or five years ago.

399
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I'll tell you why.

400
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Five or six years ago,

401
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
flooring was popular.

402
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
It started back then.

403
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Who are you talking to?

404
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
The kamaboko will come looking for a room, won't it?

405
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
The kamaboko will come looking for a room, won't it?

406
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
What's that?

407
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
A kamaboko without a board?

408
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
That's right.

409
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
What's that?

410
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I don't know.

411
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Even if you put out a tatami, it won't work.

412
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I don't need a Japanese room anymore.

413
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
He doesn't either.

414
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
He doesn't either.

415
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
There's a theory.

416
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
A theory?

417
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I think the kamaboko is a processed product.

418
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
What do you mean?

419
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
A kamaboko is a living thing.

420
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,000
A kamaboko swims like this.

421
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
It's a sea creature.

422
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
When you take a kamaboko, you dig a board like this.

423
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
You stand up like this.

424
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
You stand up like this.

425
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
You dig a board like this.

426
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,000
When you take a kamaboko, you dig a board like this.

427
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,000
When should I take off my arm pillow when I'm sleeping with my girlfriend?

428
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
When the color changes.

429
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
You take off your arm pillow before that?

430
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
If I take it off...

431
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:13,000
You look like a man. You have a gentle side.

432
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,000
You put up with it until you get a tingling sensation.

433
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
If I take it off...

434
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Your image has changed.

435
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Really?

436
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
What if the color changes?

437
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
There's no one who would do that.

438
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
There are people who don't like arm pillows.

439
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Is that so?

440
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
They don't like arm pillows.

441
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Is that so?

442
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
What is it?

443
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
There's a face around here.

444
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
It's like this.

445
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
What are you doing?

446
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Don't tell me you have a wine glass.

447
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
I have one.

448
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
You have a wine glass and an arm pillow.

449
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
How do you drink it?

450
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
When it comes to me, it's amazing.

451
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
What is?

452
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
I'll wait in the new room.

453
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,000
You take it off and go in.

454
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
You're like an old man.

455
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
You go out once.

456
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
And then bang!

457
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
What is it?

458
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
What is it?

459
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
No, no.

460
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Where do you do it?

461
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
In the room?

462
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
No, at home.

463
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
And then bang!

464
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
I'm already home.

465
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
And then you take off the arm pillow.

466
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
What kind of clothes are you wearing?

467
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Are these boots?

468
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Boots.

469
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
And then...

470
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
What is it?

471
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Boots.

472
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Boots.

473
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Boots like this?

474
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
How do you do it?

475
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
You take it off and put it down.

476
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
And then this.

477
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Wait!

478
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Both are long!

479
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
And then you take off the one here.

480
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
That's it.

481
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
What is it?

482
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Don't put it out vertically!

483
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
And then bang!

484
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
I'm already naked.

485
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
You're not wearing anything.

486
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
And then...

487
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
You take it off.

488
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
And then...

489
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
What are you doing?

490
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Wait!

491
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Don't touch it!

492
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Don't touch it!

493
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
What is this?

494
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
What is this?

495
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
You're too bright!

496
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
What is that?

497
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
What is that?

498
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
B!

499
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
B!

500
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
One at a time.

501
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
And then...

502
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Go home!

503
00:23:46,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Thank you for watching!
