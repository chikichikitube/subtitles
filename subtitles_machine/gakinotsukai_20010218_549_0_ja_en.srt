1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Isn't it perfect?

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
You have to spend money on clothes.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
You have to spend money on clothes and accessories.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Europe.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Excuse me.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Excuse me.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Good morning.

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Good morning.

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Good morning.

10
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Thank you for your help the other day.

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I was so excited.

12
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Thank you very much.

13
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I'm sorry. I can't look at your face directly.

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I'm looking at you gently.

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Today, Oshima wants to give you something.

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
So I came here.

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Me?

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Yes.

19
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Hamada-san.

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Yes.

21
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Good luck.

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
What is it?

23
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
It's my love.

24
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Thank you for your help.

25
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
What is it?

26
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
It's that.

27
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
It's that.

28
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Give it back.

29
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Why is it only Hamada?

30
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Why is it only Hamada?

31
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Why is it only Hamada?

32
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
You are a human, aren't you?

33
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
But it's a girl.

34
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
It's my love.

35
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Thank you for your help.

36
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
What is it?

37
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Did you make it yourself?

38
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Did you buy it?

39
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Why are you looking at me?

40
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Where are you?

41
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
You have a runny nose.

42
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I can't believe it.

43
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
You have a runny nose when you give me chocolates on Valentine's Day.

44
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
But...

45
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
You have a boyfriend.

46
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
You have a cool boyfriend.

47
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I broke up with Oshima because I like Hamada-san.

48
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
What?

49
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
It's a show.

50
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
What are you laughing at?

51
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I'm sorry.

52
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
What are you laughing at?

53
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
What are you laughing at?

54
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Shut up.

55
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Shut up.

56
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
It's not funny, so don't talk.

57
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I'm your senior.

58
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
What's wrong with you?

59
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I don't think you're making fun of me.

60
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I don't think you're making fun of me.

61
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Why?

62
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Why don't you accept it?

63
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Why can't I accept it?

64
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Why don't you accept it?

65
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I'll accept it.

66
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I'm sorry.

67
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Thank you.

68
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
What is it?

69
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Wait a minute.

70
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
What's wrong?

71
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Thank you.

72
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
This is close.

73
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Then Oshima will date Hamada-san.

74
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Wait a minute.

75
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Wait a minute.

76
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Wait a minute.

77
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Which side are you touching?

78
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
It's embarrassing.

79
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
It's embarrassing.

80
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Your face is embarrassing.

81
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
You're ugly.

82
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
What kind of face is that?

83
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I'm looking at you from behind, but you're in a strange state.

84
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
You're in a strange state.

85
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
It's embarrassing.

86
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
That's what happens.

87
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Shut up.

88
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
What?

89
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
What is it?

90
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
What are you talking about?

91
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
What?

92
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
What is it?

93
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
What's wrong with you?

94
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
What?

95
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
What?

96
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
What's wrong with you?

97
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
What's wrong with you?

98
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Stop it.

99
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Stop it.

100
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Stop it.

101
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Stop it.

102
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Hey! Hey!

103
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Hey!

104
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
What's wrong?

105
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Yamasaki!

106
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Are you okay?

107
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
What do you mean?

108
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
You're not going to date me because of this?

109
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
That's why you shouldn't date him.

110
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Right?

111
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Shut up, you cell phone!

112
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Hey!

113
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
You're a senior!

114
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
You're a senior!

115
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
If you win, you can go out with me.

116
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Ah, that's a bit...

117
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
That's a bit harsh.

118
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I can't accept it.

119
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I can't accept it.

120
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Let's do it.

121
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Valentine's Day!

122
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Rock, paper, scissors!

123
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Yay!

124
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Yay!

125
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I'll look at it again.

126
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I'll look at it again.

127
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
If you lose,

128
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
you have to go out with me.

129
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I'll throw away my wife and children.

130
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
After today,

131
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I'll go to a love hotel.

132
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Of course.

133
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
We'll take a picture and send it to you.

134
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
We'll take a picture and send it to you.

135
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
We'll send it to you.

136
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Please tell me the rules.

137
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
It's a familiar game,

138
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
so I'm sure you'll understand.

139
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
If you get three points, you win.

140
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Are you okay with that?

141
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Rock, paper, scissors!

142
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Rock, paper, scissors!

143
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Are you okay with that?

144
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I'll give you a penalty!

145
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I'll give you a penalty!

146
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
The first round

147
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
The first round

148
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
The first round

149
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Rock, paper, scissors!

150
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Rock, paper, scissors!

151
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
One more time!

152
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
You're too high!

153
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
One more time!

154
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Why are you doing it twice?

155
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Why are you doing it twice?

156
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
That's not right!

157
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I'm not good at it, so I can do it.

158
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
If you take it, it's over.

159
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
That's right!

160
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I can do it.

161
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
One, two, three!

162
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
High hands, high hands, rock, paper, scissors!

163
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Rock, paper, scissors!

164
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
You did it once, so don't do it twice!

165
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
You have to hit it here.

166
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I'm sorry.

167
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
One, two, three!

168
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
High hands, high hands, rock, paper, scissors!

169
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Rock, paper, scissors!

170
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Look at this!

171
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
This is a great transformation!

172
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
You can't do it with this stick!

173
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
You can't do it with a stick!

174
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Look at that!

175
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Look at this!

176
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Good luck!

177
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I'm rooting for Miyuki!

178
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Thank you!

179
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
You're easy to get along with.

180
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I can do it.

181
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
That's all you have to say.

182
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
That's all you have to say.

183
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
One, two, three!

184
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
High hands, high hands, rock, paper, scissors!

185
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
One, two, three!

186
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
High hands, high hands, rock, paper, scissors!

187
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Rock, paper, scissors!

188
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
That was dangerous!

189
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Be careful!

190
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
That was dangerous!

191
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Be careful!

192
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
One, two, three!

193
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
High hands, high hands, rock, paper, scissors!

194
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Rock, paper, scissors!

195
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
That was dangerous!

196
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Be careful!

197
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
That was dangerous!

198
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
You!

199
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
That was hard!

200
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
That was a no-go.

201
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
One, two, three!

202
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Rock, paper, scissors!

203
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
That was dangerous!

204
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
That was a no-go.

205
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
That was dangerous!

206
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
That was a no-go.

207
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Wait!

208
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Wait!

209
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
You're wearing a helmet!

210
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Why are you wearing a helmet?

211
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Are you out of your mind?

212
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
That's right.

213
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
That's right.

214
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
That's strange.

215
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
That's strange.

216
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Why?

217
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
It's strange that he's wearing a helmet.

218
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
A helmet?

219
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
It's strange that he's wearing a helmet.

220
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Why is it strange?

221
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
It's because you can't lose to someone who's half-hearted.

222
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Well, it's true that I didn't lose.

223
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
That doesn't matter.

224
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
You were losing.

225
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Okay, okay, okay.

226
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Let's say I won.

227
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Let's do it next time.

228
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Okay.

229
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
What?

230
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
What?

231
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Isn't this the end?

232
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I heard it was over.

233
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I heard it was over.

234
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Who is it, huh?

235
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Who is it, huh?

236
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Who is it?

237
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I'm wearing a helmet, so I can't start.

238
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I can't start.

239
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
It's unfair.

240
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Do you have something you want to do?

241
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Turn around, turn around, turn around and...

242
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Let's do that.

243
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
It looks like there's something.

244
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Valentine's Day of love!

245
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Turn around, turn around, turn around and...

246
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Let's have a one-shot match.

247
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
One-shot match.

248
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I think we can do it.

249
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Is that okay?

250
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Put it on your forehead and turn around 10 times.

251
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Ready!

252
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:35,000
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10!

253
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Hurry up!

254
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Amada-san wins!

255
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Thank you!

256
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Let's go!

257
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Wait a minute!

258
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Wait a minute!

259
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
What?

260
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I haven't lost yet.

261
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
You haven't lost?

262
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
It's already over.

263
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
It's not over, it's not over.

264
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
What about the next game?

265
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
It's not over.

266
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Let's do it again.

267
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I can't help it because I've already turned my eyes.

268
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
That's right.

269
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Can't you let me do it again?

270
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
This is strange.

271
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
It's strange.

272
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I thought I was going to lose, so I asked someone else to do it.

273
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Who are you going to ask?

274
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Amada is good at turning.

275
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
So I can't win.

276
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Then why do you know it?

277
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I know it and I'll do it.

278
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
It's true.

279
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
You can't do that.

280
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
It's strange.

281
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
It's a strange story.

282
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
It's true.

283
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Where are you from?

284
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Where are you from?

285
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Don't you want to do something?

286
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
There's something else.

287
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
What is it?

288
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Valentine's Day is approaching and I'm in Hamadan.

289
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I'm in Hamadan.

290
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Hamadan?

291
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
It's the name of the person you like.

292
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Well, I don't know.

293
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Do you want to do it?

294
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I really want to do it.

295
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
This is the second time.

296
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
It's a mess.

297
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
What you're doing is a mess.

298
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
It's worse than us.

299
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
It's a good thing.

300
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
It's a good thing.

301
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Valentine's Day is approaching and I'm in Hamadan.

302
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I'll say it again.

303
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I have to go out with you.

304
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I can't go out.

305
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I'll do my best.

306
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I'll do my best.

307
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I'll do my best.

308
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I'll do my best.

309
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
We can do it.

310
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
We can do it.

311
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
That's what it means.

312
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
It's a mess.

313
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
It's a mess.

314
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
It's a mess.

315
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I can do it.

316
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
You can do it!!

317
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Just a little more!!

318
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
It's dangerous!

319
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
You can do it, you can do it!!

320
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Miyuki-chan, you can do it!!

321
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Hamada-san, you got it!!

322
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Hamada-san is here!

323
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Mugi-chan, go!

324
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Hamada-san is here!

325
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Hamada-san is here!

326
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Hamada-san is here!

327
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
It's outside.

328
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Mugi-chan!

329
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Mugi-chan, go!

330
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
How are you feeling?

331
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I'm feeling like a otakebi.

332
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Otakebi!

333
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Otakebi!

334
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Hamada-san, damn it.

335
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Kill him! Kill him!

336
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Oh! Wow, great power!

337
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Hamada-san, be careful!

338
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
He's been taken down!

339
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
He's been taken down!

340
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Ah, it's no good.

341
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
It's no good.

342
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
It's no good.

343
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
It's no good.

344
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
It's no good.

345
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
It's no good.

346
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
It's no good.

347
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
It's no good.

348
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
It's no good.

349
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
It's no good.

350
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
What's wrong?

351
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
What's wrong?

352
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
It hurts.

353
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
It hurts?

354
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Where does it hurt?

355
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
My heart.

356
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Your heart.

357
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
You were beaten by Gringo, right?

358
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
You were beaten.

359
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
It hurts?

360
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
You don't have to lose it.

361
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Ah, I'm frustrated.

362
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Frustrated.

363
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Frustrated.

364
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
What should we do?

365
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
What should we do?

366
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
What should we do?

367
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
What should we do?

368
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
He's an old man.

369
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
He's an old man.

370
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
He's an old man.

371
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
He's a very busy old man.

372
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
What should we do?

373
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
What should we do?

374
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
What should we do?

375
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Well, we'll just get some chocolate.

376
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Yes, yes.

377
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
We can't go out with him.

378
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Yes.

379
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
