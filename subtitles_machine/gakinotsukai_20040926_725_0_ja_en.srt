1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
In the first episode of Gake no Skyer, we're going to talk about a good story that really happened.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Manager vs. E-Episode Contest!

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
What are you doing?

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
This is a bit strange.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
It's not strange.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
It's hard.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
E-Episode Contest?

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
What do you mean?

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:29,000
This time, we're going to have each manager compete with each other in an E-Episode.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
E-Episode?

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
The manager is already tired.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Are you okay?

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
When I came into the studio, no one said hello to me.

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I can't see you.

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
That's strange.

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
It's strange.

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
This is hard.

18
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I've only slept for about two hours.

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Matsumoto is in charge of Tajima.

20
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Hamada is in charge of the 7th grade, Kimoto.

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Yamasaki is in charge of Miyamoto.

22
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Endo is still in charge of Yoshida.

23
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Tanaka is in charge of Nishibayashi.

24
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Each manager will introduce his talent in writing.

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
There will be two rounds.

26
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
The judges will give you points for each round.

27
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
There are judges?

28
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
There are judges.

29
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
What?

30
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I called them.

31
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The person with the highest score will be the winner.

32
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Do you fine with it?

33
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Excuse me.

34
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Are you wrong?

35
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Please explain the rules.

36
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Please explain the rules.

37
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
No, let's talk about it later.

38
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
He must be the most grandmother.

39
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
He is the president of SUGONEXECTIVE.

40
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Hello!

41
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I brought a character with me.

42
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
A character?

43
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I brought a character with me.

44
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Next is Heipo-san.

45
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I'm Heipo. Nice to meet you.

46
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Please remember my name. I'm Heipo.

47
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Really?

48
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I don't need that.

49
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
What kind of character?

50
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
What kind of character do you have in mind?

51
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
And this time, we have a gentleman from a woman's point of view.

52
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
It's Yatsu Megumi-san.

53
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Nice to meet you.

54
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
This is a rare opportunity.

55
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I'm surprised why you called me here.

56
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Right?

57
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Nice to meet you.

58
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
You can't see this kind of high-profile scene, can you?

59
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
This program is brought to you by five sponsors.

60
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
First, we have Tanaka-san's manager, Ryo Nishibayashi.

61
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Nice to meet you.

62
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Nice to meet you.

63
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Tanaka Naoki's manager, Ryo Nishibayashi.

64
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
About two years ago, I had an important job.

65
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I had to wake up on the morning of the recording day.

66
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
One morning, I fell asleep.

67
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I got a call from Tanaka-san.

68
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I was in a hurry and I thought I was going to get in trouble.

69
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
When I got on the phone, Tanaka-san said,

70
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Nishi-kun, were you sleeping? I'm awake, so I'm fine.

71
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Please call Endo.

72
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
He didn't blame me at all.

73
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
He was concerned about his partner.

74
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I was so kind.

75
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I felt Tanaka-san's kindness again.

76
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
After that, I called Endo-san right away.

77
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Endo-san was already awake.

78
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I thought he was sleeping.

79
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
When I left him alone, Tanaka-san was late.

80
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I thought it was funny, so I kept quiet.

81
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
He said, ha ha ha ha.

82
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
As you can see from this,

83
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Tanaka-san is a really nice person.

84
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Thank you very much.

85
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Thank you very much.

86
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
It's nice to be compared to me like that.

87
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
It's nice to be compared to me like that.

88
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
At least accept it.

89
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
He's a really bad guy.

90
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
That's true.

91
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Tanaka's story is true.

92
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
It's embarrassing.

93
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
It's embarrassing.

94
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Let's see the score.

95
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Please show us the score.

96
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
8 points, 7 points, 8 points.

97
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
That's a total of 23 points.

98
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
It's a bit sweet, Nishi-san.

99
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
It's sweet.

100
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Yatsu-san, what did you think of the story?

101
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
As you can see, Tanaka-san is a really nice person.

102
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
He's kind.

103
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Hama-san, Hama-san.

104
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Hama-san, Hama-san.

105
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Hama-san, Hama-san.

106
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Hama-san, Hama-san.

107
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Let's move on to the next story.

108
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Endo-san's manager, Yoshida.

109
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Thank you very much.

110
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Endo-san's manager, Yoshida.

111
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:12,000
This is a story I heard from Endo-san's favorite junior comedian, Kōri-san.

112
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Kōri-san used to take Endo to DisneySea.

113
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Kōri-san remembered that he had a show in Lumiere that day.

114
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
He couldn't tell Endo-san about it.

115
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
On that day, there were a lot of people in the park.

116
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
It was evening when he got on one of the rides.

117
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Kōri-san, who was in a hurry, shook off his courage and said,

118
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I'm sorry, Endo-san.

119
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Actually, I forgot that I had a show in Lumiere today.

120
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
When he said that, Endo-san was shocked and sent Kōri-san out.

121
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,000
When Kōri-san called Endo-san right after the show at 9 p.m.,

122
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
He said, I have something to talk to you about, so come back.

123
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
He was called out by the manager.

124
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Kōri-san thought he was going to get in trouble, but when he returned to DisneySea,

125
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Endo-san was waiting near the entrance.

126
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
When Kōri-san came, he said, let's go.

127
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,000
He had already started walking towards DisneySea, which was closed.

128
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
And when Kōri-san made up his mind,

129
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
You've only been on one attraction, haven't you?

130
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I've already paid for it, so I can't take the ride, but let's take a walk.

131
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Kōri-san was so moved that he couldn't stop crying.

132
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I thought it was really good that I was his manager.

133
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Thank you very much.

134
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Is this true?

135
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Everyone went back to where they were going.

136
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I thought it would be hard for the juniors to play.

137
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
What? You feel sorry for them?

138
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I felt a little sorry for them.

139
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I think it would be better to return DisneySea from Shinjuku.

140
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
That's true.

141
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Thank you very much.

142
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
3 points!

143
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
5 points!

144
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
16 points!

145
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
There's something about this, right?

146
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Sugata-san got 3 points.

147
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Endo isn't that kind of guy.

148
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
What?

149
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Some of the juniors said,

150
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
It's close to harassment, isn't it?

151
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
You can think of it that way.

152
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Let's go.

153
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I'm Hosei Yamasaki's manager, Miyamoto.

154
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Thank you very much.

155
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Go ahead.

156
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Hosei Yamasaki.

157
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Let's do it again.

158
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
It's okay, it's okay.

159
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Yamakawa-san, Yamakawa-san.

160
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
It's okay, it's okay.

161
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
How can you say the name of Hato's talent?

162
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
What do you think?

163
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Yamakawa-san, Yamakawa-san.

164
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Let's go.

165
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I'm Miyamoto's manager.

166
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I'm Hosei Yamasaki's manager, Miyamoto Yu.

167
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,000
This is a story from when I was just in charge of Yamasaki-san.

168
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Yamasaki-san will be participating in the R1 Grand Prix.

169
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,000
When I was making up a story with the intention of winning,

170
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:16,000
He listened to my opinion, who was a new employee, and gave me an idea.

171
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
As a talent, he didn't treat me badly.

172
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
He adjusted the length of the story, the sound, and the length of the story.

173
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
He did everything from the same perspective.

174
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I was so happy that I couldn't put it into words.

175
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I was so happy that I could put it into words.

176
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Unfortunately, I lost in the semi-finals.

177
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I was in the car on my way home, and I was about to eat a pot.

178
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I was sorry at that time, so I said I would help.

179
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Yamasaki-san said, looking at the TV in the A,

180
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I'm making a special dumpling for Yamachan right now.

181
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
We drank together on the way home, and he said,

182
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I'm sorry, Miyamoto. I had you do a lot of things, but I couldn't answer you.

183
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I will never forget that I was about to cry.

184
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
To be honest, the story of the semi-finals wasn't interesting.

185
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,000
But I swore to myself that I would follow him for the rest of my life.

186
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Thank you very much.

187
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
He's not just an amateur, he's a manager.

188
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
He helped me.

189
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
He's a new employee.

190
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Thank you very much.

191
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
5 points, 9 points, 9 points.

192
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
The total is 23 points.

193
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Yasu-san, 9 points.

194
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
It's a good story.

195
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I made a dumpling.

196
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Yamachan dumpling.

197
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I would be very happy if I were a manager.

198
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I see.

199
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I didn't agree with everyone's story.

200
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Hamada-san's story.

201
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I'm Hamada-san's manager, Kimitoshi.

202
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Please.

203
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I'm Hamada-san's manager, Kimitoshi.

204
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
It was like this.

205
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
It's okay.

206
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
It was a hot summer day.

207
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
It's not hot.

208
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
It's not hot.

209
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
It's not hot.

210
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
It was a hot summer day.

211
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
It was hot.

212
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
It's not hot.

213
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
It was a hot summer day.

214
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Let's go.

215
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I'm Hamada-san's manager, Kimoto.

216
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Please.

217
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
It was a hot summer day.

218
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I was filming a drama outside.

219
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
The staff was tired.

220
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
When I got tired, Hamada-san asked me.

221
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Can you do it in the heat?

222
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Kimoto, buy ice cream.

223
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I bought ice cream and came back.

224
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Hamada-san saw the ice cream and bought it for everyone.

225
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I gave the ice cream to everyone.

226
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
But this was all Hamada-san's care.

227
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Hamada-san didn't want to eat ice cream.

228
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
He said he'd let the staff eat it.

229
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
He said he'd let the staff eat it.

230
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
He was actually listening to me from behind.

231
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I was supporting him to buy ice cream for everyone.

232
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I was supporting him to buy ice cream for everyone.

233
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I was impressed by Hamada-san's kindness.

234
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I was impressed by Hamada-san's kindness.

235
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Thank you.

236
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Thank you.

237
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I've heard that before.

238
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I'm not good at talking.

239
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
It's a one-sided story.

240
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I'm not good at talking.

241
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Please give me a score.

242
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
7 points, 10 points, 6 points.

243
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
A total of 23 points.

244
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Heipo got 10 points.

245
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
It's not something I can do.

246
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I've worked with many people.

247
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I don't have any ice cream memories.

248
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
That's what I'm saying.

249
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I'll give you ice cream.

250
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I don't know.

251
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Yasu-san, what do you think?

252
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I don't think it's a big deal.

253
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I don't think it's a big deal.

254
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I don't think it's a big deal.

255
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Let's move on.

256
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I'm the manager of Matsumoto-san.

257
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I'm the manager of Matsumoto-san.

258
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I'm the manager of Matsumoto-san.

259
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
This is when I helped Matsumoto-san move.

260
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Matsumoto-san had a big TV and a massage chair.

261
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Matsumoto-san had a big TV and a massage chair.

262
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I was wondering if I should get rid of the sofa and microwave.

263
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
They're all new and expensive.

264
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
They're all new and expensive.

265
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I didn't have any money, so I asked for it.

266
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I didn't have any money, so I asked for it.

267
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Matsumoto-san said yes.

268
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Matsumoto-san said yes.

269
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Matsumoto-san said yes.

270
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Matsumoto-san looked like a god.

271
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Matsumoto-san looked like a god.

272
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Then I asked Matsumoto-san to sell it.

273
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Then I asked Matsumoto-san to sell it.

274
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:13,560
Matsumoto-san sold all the

275
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Did Matsumoto-san make me feel like?

276
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
He's selling everything for 100,000 yen.

277
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
What are you talking about?

278
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
What are you talking about?

279
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
That's a good story.

280
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
What are you talking about?

281
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
That's a good story.

282
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Let's go to the end.

283
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:46,000
At this time, I was moved by the greatness of Mr. Matsumoto, who is not only kind but also considerate of the opponent's feelings.

284
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
It's over.

285
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
It's over.

286
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
You are being deceived.

287
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
That's great.

288
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
What are you talking about?

289
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:02,000
This is a good story between me and Tajima.

290
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Don't be so stubborn.

291
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
This is a strange story.

292
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
You are being deceived.

293
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I'm a little disappointed.

294
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Please judge.

295
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
3 points, 10 points, 7 points.

296
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
20 points.

297
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
20 points.

298
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
10 points.

299
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
This is not something that can be done easily.

300
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
You gave it to him for free, didn't you?

301
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
What?

302
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Which way do you want to go?

303
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I'm sorry.

304
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
What kind of feeling do you want to get?

305
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Give me a snack.

306
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Give me a snack.

307
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I was originally given a snack.

308
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
After this, Tanaka hit the car and made an honest apology.

309
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
He got 28 points.

310
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Endo got 19 points.

311
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Yamasaki refused Matsumoto's invitation.

312
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
He got 23 points.

313
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Let's continue.

314
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
This is Mr. Hamada's manager, Mr. Kimoto.

315
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I'll leave it to you.

316
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Mr. Kimoto.

317
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Go ahead.

318
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
This is a story about a certain year.

319
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
There was a game competition where players and staff won various prizes.

320
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Two people in downtown won Don Quijote's prize.

321
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Matsumoto received the prize and opened the bag immediately to check the contents.

322
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
He said, I can't put it in my wallet because it's big.

323
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
He was happy to receive the prize.

324
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
However, Mr. Hamada gave me a prize saying,

325
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Thank you for always working hard.

326
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Buy what you like.

327
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Not only me, but also Tajima, who is in charge of Matsumoto.

328
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
He said, I can't get it from Matsumoto.

329
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
He gave me a gift card.

330
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Mr. Hamada, who cares about his partner's manager,

331
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I felt his heart as a man.

332
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Thank you.

333
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,000
This is a wonderful story.

334
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
There is a hidden theme in this corner.

335
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
There is a hidden theme.

336
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I don't know if you asked Tajima.

337
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Actually, even now.

338
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Why?

339
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I got 10 tickets for 10,000 yen.

340
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I used 9 tickets, but I gave one to Mr. Hamada as a souvenir.

341
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
There is no evidence of what Mr. Hamada gave me.

342
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I gave it to you because it's Don Quijote.

343
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I gave it to you because it's Don Quijote.

344
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I gave it to you because it's Don Quijote.

345
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I gave it to you because it's Don Quijote.

346
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I gave it to you because it's Don Quijote.

347
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Mr. Prodigy got 10 tickets for it.

348
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,000
He obtained the manager's prop 240shore equally.

349
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
This is amazing.

350
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
10 points.

351
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
It's a sincere story.

352
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
That's right.

353
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
It's wonderful.

354
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I'm a little curious about the price of the ice cream and the products.

355
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
That's right.

356
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
It's a little bit of an object.

357
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I'm a little curious about that, but it's a good story.

358
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
It's a good story.

359
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I'd like to go to the end of the second lap.

360
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I'm the manager of Mr. Matsumoto, Mr. Tajima.

361
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Go ahead.

362
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I want you to show me that.

363
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,000
This is a story I heard from Mr. Fujiwara, my senior manager.

364
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:31,000
When I went to pick up Mr. Matsumoto at home, Mr. Fujiwara found a plate in the garden.

365
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I was wondering why there was a plate in the garden, and when I looked at the plate,

366
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I saw a cat that looked like a stray cat in the neighborhood approaching the plate.

367
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Actually, Mr. Matsumoto put a plate in the garden so that the stray cat in the neighborhood wouldn't get hungry.

368
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:53,000
And when the cat meowed at Mr. Matsumoto,

369
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Mr. Matsumoto was embarrassed and said to Mr. Fujiwara,

370
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Let's go.

371
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
When I heard this story,

372
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,000
When this person said, let's go, I followed him everywhere.

373
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
My chest got hot.

374
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Thank you very much.

375
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Is this true?

376
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
It's embarrassing.

377
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
It's a previous apartment.

378
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,000
A little cat came to the garden.

379
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I fed the cat twice.

380
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Let's go to the other side.

381
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
The cat meowed again.

382
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
6 points, 10 points, 9 points.

383
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
It's a little high.

384
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
It's high.

385
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
A total of 25 points.

386
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Now that we've finished the two rounds,

387
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
From now on, let's go to the next episode.

388
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Let's go to the next episode.

389
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Let's go to the next episode.

390
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Let's go to the next episode.

391
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,000
When I got on the car with Mr. Tanaka after work,

392
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
On the way, Mr. Tanaka said,

393
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I want to go shopping, so I'm going to Urahara.

394
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Is this the face of Urahara?

395
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Mr. Tanaka said sorry.

396
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I'm sorry to have you go out with me.

397
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I'll buy you shoes.

398
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Why shoes?

399
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I don't want to hear it.

400
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:35,000
I don't want to hear it.

401
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I'm fine until I get your feelings.

402
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I don't like that story.

403
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I was surprised that you were doing that.

404
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I was surprised. I was rejected at that time, but I thought he was such a nice person.

405
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
He was kind.

406
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
I'll give you a minus.

407
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I'll give you a minus.

408
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
2 points. 5 points. 5 points.

409
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
12 points.

410
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
That's amazing.

411
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
He's kind.

412
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Who wants to go?

413
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Yoshige.

414
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Who wants to go?

415
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Who wants to go?

416
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Go there.

417
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
There's only one person.

418
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
If you say something, I'll hit you.

419
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
I can't stand it anymore.

420
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
I can't stand it anymore.

421
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Let's go, Mr. Kimoto.

422
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
It's a recent story.

423
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Mr. Watanabe's family happened to pass by a house near his house.

424
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:42,000
He said hello to his family and went shopping.

425
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:49,000
He brought a cold drink and a cold beer to the house.

426
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:57,000
He brought a cold drink and a cold beer to the house.

427
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,000
He brought a cold drink and a cold beer to the house.

428
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
He can do it in an instant.

429
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
He's different from everyone.

430
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
He's getting used to it.

431
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
He's getting used to it.

432
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Let's see the scores.

433
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Please.

434
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
1 point. 5 points. 4 points.

435
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Listen to me.

436
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
I'm sick of these things.

437
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
That's right.

438
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Hamada, Yamasaki, and Endo's team added an extra episode.

439
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
The score so far is as you can see.

440
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Who has an episode?

441
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Let's go.

442
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Who is it?

443
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Let's go.

444
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I can't wait any longer.

445
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
We've already seen most of it.

446
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
We've already seen most of it.

447
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
I can't wait any longer.

448
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
I can't wait any longer.

449
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Tashima, go.

450
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Let's go.

451
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I've been working with Matsumoto-san for about four years.

452
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,000
We had dinner together.

453
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:02,000
We had ramen when we got our license.

454
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
We had ramen for the first time.

455
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
That ramen was...

456
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
That ramen was...

457
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
That ramen was really good.

458
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
What happened then?

459
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
He said nice things.

460
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
He said nice things.

461
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
He said nice things.

462
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
He talked about martial arts.

463
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
That's no good.

464
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
You're the one who said that.

465
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
You're the one who said that.

466
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
I was really happy.

467
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Okay, that's the end of the show.

468
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
It's the end.

469
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
It's finally over.

470
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
It's the end of the episode.

471
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
It's the end.

472
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
The winner is...

473
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
The winner is...

474
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
72 points.

475
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Hamada-san.

476
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Thank you.

477
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Thank you.

478
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
This is a good one.

479
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
What is this?

480
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
This is a good one.

481
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
What is this?

482
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,000
The winner Hamada-san's team will receive these five prizes.

483
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,000
This is a TV call from Academy Japan.

484
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
This is a hair watch from Fossil Japan.

485
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:07,000
And this is a cruiser bike from Marui.

486
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
How was it?

487
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
If there's something like this, I want you to do your best.

488
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
I don't have anything to say.

489
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
I have a lot of stories about having a son.

490
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Seriously?

491
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Unfortunately.

492
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Why are you saying that?

493
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Tell us about your son.

494
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Now you're telling me to save him.

495
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Tell us about your son.

496
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
I don't want to hear that.

497
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
I don't want to hear that.

498
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Tell me about your son.

499
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
It's simple.

500
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Tell me about your son.

501
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Tell me about your son.

502
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
I'll tell you.

503
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
It's going to be quick.

504
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Get it quick.

505
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
This is recent.

506
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
It's recent.

507
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
It was about your son.

508
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
My son...

509
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Kojikawa, Kojikawa, Kojikawa

510
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
The two of us

511
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
I want to eat Kojikawa

512
00:23:49,000 --> 00:24:11,000
This program was brought to you by 5 sponsors
