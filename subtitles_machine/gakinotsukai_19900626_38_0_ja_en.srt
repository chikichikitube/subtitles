1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Chikisugi Bon-san has arrived!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Jan Jan Jan Jan Jan Jan Jan!

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Bon-san has arrived, Bon-san

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Hello

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I am...

6
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
like B's Hiromi

7
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I hate wearing things

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
You are wearing it

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Hey!

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Who would throw a trash can like this?

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
So in Osaka,

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
while Bon-san is saying he has arrived

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
the other guys are playing

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Indian Fundo

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Indian Fundo?

16
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Yes, in the center of the Kanto region

17
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
they play Indian Fundo all over the country

18
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
After that,

19
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Chuchu Takokahina

20
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
This is

21
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
all over Japan

22
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
In Tokyo,

23
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
this stupid thing is called

24
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Tako, right?

25
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
It comes from there

26
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Chuchu Takokahina

27
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Daruma-san is from Cologne

28
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
It costs money

29
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
It costs money

30
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Daruma-san is from Cologne

31
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
From Hokkaido to Kyushu,

32
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
all over Japan

33
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Everyone is from Cologne

34
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Well,

35
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
there is no origin

36
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
there is nothing

37
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Well, there is nothing

38
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
There is something in the Philippines

39
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
What are you talking about?

40
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
The SM center is shaking

41
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
What are you talking about?

42
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
What are you talking about?

43
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Bon-san is here!

44
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Hey!

45
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
What? Me?

46
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
You are obviously...

47
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Don't make a fool of me

48
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Bon-san is here!

49
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Hey!

50
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I don't know what you are talking about

51
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:58,000
What are you talking about?

52
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
What are you talking about?

53
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Don't make a fool of me

54
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Bon-san is here!

55
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Don't do that

56
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Don't do that

57
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Don't do that

58
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Don't do that

59
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Bon-san is here!

60
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
What are you doing?

61
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I can't see you

62
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Bon-san is here!

63
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Don't do that

64
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Bon-san is here!

65
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Hey!

66
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
You are perfect

67
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Hey!

68
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Kobayashi

69
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Hey!

70
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Hey!

71
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Bon-san is here

72
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Hey!

73
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I can't see you

74
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Wait a minute!

75
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Wait a minute

76
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Look at this

77
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I want to jump in when I see you

78
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Look at this

79
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Hey

80
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
You should talk to this guy

81
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
That's right.

82
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Mon-san moved his room!

83
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Mon-san moved his room!

84
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
He moved!

85
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
No, he's a kid!

86
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
He's a kid.

87
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Mon-san moved his room!

88
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Mon-san moved his room!

89
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Mon-san moved his room!

90
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Mon-san moved his room!

91
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Mon-san moved his room!

92
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Mon-san moved his room!

93
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Wait!

94
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
No one's stopping me!

95
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Mon-san moved his room!

96
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
You!

97
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
You can't touch me like that!

98
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Mon-san moved his room!

99
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8! Stop!

100
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
1, 2, 3!

101
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
That's too much.

102
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I was thinking the same thing.

103
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Sorry! What happened?

104
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I'm sorry!

105
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I was thinking the same thing.

106
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
You're kidding, right?

107
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I was thinking the same thing.

108
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
You're kidding, right?

109
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I'm kidding.

110
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8! Stop!

111
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Damn it!

112
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I can't go any further.

113
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Damn it! I'm going to get kicked out!

114
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Let's go!

115
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
What should I do?

116
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8!

117
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Stop!

118
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Hello!

119
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Hello!

120
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Let's do our best.

121
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
You're drinking, right?

122
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I drank a lot today.

123
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
You're so noisy!

124
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I hope it's quiet when I drink.

125
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
That's right.

126
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I hope it's quiet when I drink.

127
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Today, I'm wearing a beige outfit.

128
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
That's right.

129
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
When I was handed this outfit,

130
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I was wondering how I should wear it.

131
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
How should I wear it?

132
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I was wondering if other staff members should put their bangs in.

133
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
No, it's not like that.

134
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
It doesn't matter.

135
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
This is Yokoyama's business.

136
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Recently, Hamada-kun started a drama, right?

137
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
No, I didn't start it.

138
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
No, I didn't start it.

139
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
No, I didn't start it.

140
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
No, I didn't start it.

141
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,000
He gave me the drama, and he gave me the drama.

142
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
You just don't want to do it.

143
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I don't like dramas.

144
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
You just don't want to do it.

145
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
It's a long drama, right?

146
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Yes, it's a long drama.

147
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
It doesn't go well with the show.

148
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
But in terms of acting skills, I'm ten times better than you.

149
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
In terms of acting skills and singing skills, you're better than me.

150
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I'm serious.

151
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
If that's what you think, then that's fine.

152
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Huh?

153
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Do you think I'm better than you in singing?

154
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Idiot!

155
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Well, you came out.

156
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
It's an opening, so I can't say anything about it.

157
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I'm losing.

158
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Wait.

159
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
No, seriously.

160
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
What?

161
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Yoshimoto is bad at singing, but you're Shinsuke Shimada.

162
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
What are you talking about?

163
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
It's something everyone can acknowledge.

164
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Please include Akashiya Sanma, too.

165
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Sanma, too.

166
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
These three.

167
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Why?

168
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
You're the best in singing.

169
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Idiot!

170
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
You're good, right?

171
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Good, good.

172
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
You don't know what recording is, right?

173
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
You sing along, right?

174
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
You cut out all the good parts.

175
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
And then you connect all the good parts and make it into one song.

176
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
It's not like the guy who sang along is in the recording.

177
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Idiot, in your case,

178
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I have this much range.

179
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
That's not true.

180
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
It took you three hours to record, but I finished it in 30 minutes.

181
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
That's because the song is different.

182
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
It doesn't matter.

183
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I asked you to listen to your own song.

184
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I never take off my real voice.

185
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Hey, isn't the song by Hibari Misora difficult?

186
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
No, it's not.

187
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Ah, like a river.

188
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
You're making me angry.

189
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I don't know if it's an explanation, but

190
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I don't sing that song as an example.

191
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I don't know about that.

192
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I don't know about that kind of shocker.

193
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I'll sing it like a river.

194
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Shut up.

195
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I'll close my eyes and sing it.

196
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Ah, like a river.

197
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I can't sing at all.

198
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
It's a song you've never sung before.

199
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I can't sing at all.

200
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Then sing it.

201
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I'll sing it.

202
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I'll tell you a story.

203
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
When I sing, it feels like a river is flowing.

204
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I'm opening the space.

205
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Ah.

206
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I have a good singing ability.

207
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I'll never be able to sing well.

208
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
For example, I'm looking back and

209
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I'm waiting for my girlfriend.

210
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
My girlfriend is pretty tall.

211
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I'll run to her from the other side.

212
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Then I'll look back and

213
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
smile at her.

214
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Why do you like that kind of smile?

215
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I can't talk to you because you're fresh.

216
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
No, you're the easiest to lose.

217
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
His smile is...

218
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I'll be shocked.

219
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
No, it's not like that.

220
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Look back and smile.

221
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I'm waiting for my girlfriend.

222
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I noticed her.

223
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I'll hit her shoulder.

224
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
That's strange.

225
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Why?

226
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Why?

227
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
That's your stupid thing.

228
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I just made a fresh face.

229
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I didn't listen to you after that.

230
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
That's because you hit her shoulder.

231
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
You don't know that she's your girlfriend.

232
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Why are you laughing?

233
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I'm that kind of person.

234
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Really?

235
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Yes.

236
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
No matter who says it.

237
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
That's the first thing.

238
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
It's normal to notice her

239
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
after you know who it is.

240
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
You can't be a member of the Self-Defense Force.

241
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
That's true.

242
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
What did you say?

243
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Let's go.

244
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I'm irritated.

245
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
It's been 30 minutes.

246
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
What's wrong with her?

247
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I can't wait any longer.

248
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Matsumoto.

249
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
He's licking her.

250
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Why?

251
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
What's with your face?

252
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Why?

253
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Your smile is worth a million dollars.

254
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,000
There's a scene like that.

255
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
There's a funny scene in a comedy drama.

256
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
The boss says something.

257
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
The boss looks behind him.

258
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
He looks at you and says,

259
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
You're annoying.

260
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
He looks at you and says,

261
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
What?

262
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
He does that.

263
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
He does that.

264
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Stop it.

265
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Stop it.

266
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Stop it.

267
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Let's see the letter.

268
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Here you go.

269
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
You have a nice style.

270
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Let me introduce you.

271
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Ebihara Yumi.

272
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
How old are you?

273
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
43?

274
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Are you 22?

275
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I'm 43.

276
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Do you have a boyfriend?

277
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
When I asked her,

278
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
she said yes.

279
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
She said it clearly.

280
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I don't have a boyfriend.

281
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Why?

282
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
You don't have a boyfriend?

283
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
No.

284
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Why?

285
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Why?

286
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I'm a police officer.

287
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:31,000
But you have a lonely side, don't you?

288
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
No way.

289
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Thank you very much.

290
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Which one should I start with?

291
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Anything is fine.

292
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Should I read this?

293
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Your pen name is Tokumekibo.

294
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
No one does that.

295
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
You shouldn't laugh at that.

296
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I can't open my mouth.

297
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

298
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

299
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I'll read it clearly.

300
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Open your mouth more.

301
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Tokumekibo.

302
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Tokumekibo.

303
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Your pen name is Pekepeke.

304
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,000
My school has a name that makes people laugh when they go to Osaka.

305
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
It's called Baba Dai.

306
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Baba Dai.

307
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Really?

308
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I'm sorry to say this,

309
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
but my mother is from Osaka,

310
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
so she laughed when she heard this name at the entrance ceremony.

311
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
You don't know what I'm talking about, do you?

312
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
You do, don't you?

313
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,000
In Osaka, Baba means poop.

314
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
So people don't think much about it.

315
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
But in Osaka, people laugh at Baba Dai.

316
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
That's the way it is.

317
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
You can be bullied for this.

318
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Poor thing.

319
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
The other day, I took a train in Tokyo.

320
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I was riding with my friends,

321
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
and I said, I want to be a Baba.

322
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
People who take trains in Tokyo are completely normal.

323
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Oh, sorry, sorry.

324
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I didn't realize until now.

325
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
That's it.

326
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

327
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Wait, wait.

328
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
That's it.

329
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
It doesn't matter if you're an idol or not.

330
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
It doesn't matter if you're an idol or not.

331
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
No, that's not what I mean.

332
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I don't care if you're an idol or not.

333
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I don't care if you're an idol or not.

334
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I'll tell you a story from here.

335
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:45,000
You'll be surprised.

336
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
How about this?

337
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
This is pretty interesting.

338
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Yoshimoto once a year talks about negotiating his salary.

339
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Now, Mr. Ikuyo Kurio is negotiating in a see-through costume.

340
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Mr. Shinsuke is negotiating in a roll.

341
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Mr. Norio is trying to negotiate by introducing a woman.

342
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
At the end, Mr. Nozawako from downtown said,

343
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I haven't noticed this mechanism yet.

344
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I haven't noticed this mechanism yet.

345
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
And if you want to negotiate, how do you negotiate?

346
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
By the way, Mr. Hanshin Kyojin said,

347
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,000
If you don't wake up and work, you can take a rest for the rest of your life.

348
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Negotiation is...

349
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I'm...

350
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I'm properly separated.

351
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I negotiate for work.

352
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
This regular is...

353
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Let's do it.

354
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
It's better than this.

355
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I want to do this.

356
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
This is money, right?

357
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
This is my money.

358
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
This is my money.

359
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
You're so mean.

360
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,000
You came to me first because you couldn't say anything.

361
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
He's dirty.

362
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
You are dirty.

363
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I'll sell my hair if I have to.

364
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
You're a warlord.

365
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
You're a warlord.

366
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
You're the one who was dirty from the beginning.

367
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
You came to the studio as a manager.

368
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Why are you giving me so much money on this show?

369
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Please, you idiot.

370
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I can't do it anymore.

371
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I've been doing it all the time.

372
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Month after month.

373
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Why are you giving me so much money?

374
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I've been doing it all the time.

375
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I've been doing it all the time.

376
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I've been doing it all the time.

377
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I've been doing it all the time.

378
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I've been doing it all the time.

379
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Even if I'm told to negotiate for money,

380
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I ask the manager.

381
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
The manager said,

382
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Let's negotiate for money.

383
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Let's talk while eating.

384
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
The two of us.

385
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
My manager and the manager.

386
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
While eating yakiniku.

387
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
How much do you want?

388
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
How much do you want?

389
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
No, I'm not.

390
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
What do you think?

391
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I'm addicted to money.

392
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Hey!

393
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
You're really making it up.

394
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
What are you?

395
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Why am I giving you so much?

396
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
And then I started.

397
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I've been doing it all the time.

398
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
The manager is so rude.

399
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I'm not doing it.

400
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I don't need money.

401
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Why are you doing it all the time?

402
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I'm not a manager with any power.

403
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I don't have money.

404
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Why is it so little?

405
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
What's the matter with you?

406
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
What's wrong with you?

407
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
What's wrong with you?

408
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I don't need any money.

409
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Don't lie.

410
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I thought I could do this job, too.

411
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
All right.

412
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I'm done.

413
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I'm not going to give you my money.

414
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
What are you happy about?

415
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I'm not shocked.

416
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
It's a strange company.

417
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Shinsuke was joking.

418
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I went to the manager.

419
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I'm sorry.

420
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I'll give you the money.

421
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Take off your jacket and come to me.

422
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I'm serious.

423
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I'm not going to give you my money.

424
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
What will you do if I win?

425
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I was joking.

426
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I asked him to give me my money.

427
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
He said he'd do it.

428
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
He said he'd do it.

429
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
He told me to come to him.

430
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
What a strange company.

431
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
It's a strange company.

432
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
The chairman of the company.

433
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,000
He was the one who won the Yoshimoto.

434
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
He is like a child.

435
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
How old is he? 80?

436
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
No, he is 92 years old.

437
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
He is holding a cane.

438
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
He is holding a cane in the office and making a fuss.

439
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
It's a serious story.

440
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
He is holding a cane and making a fuss.

441
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I asked him what happened.

442
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
He said he went to the toilet and he didn't poop.

443
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:54,000
He wrote to his manager that he would flush the toilet if he went to the toilet.

444
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
And asked him to push the handle.

445
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
He is like a roller coaster.

446
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Is that so?

447
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Yes, it is.

448
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
There is also a manager who was found to be a woman in the toilet.

449
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Yes, there is.

450
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
He was found and asked,

451
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Am I a man?

452
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
He said,

453
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I'm sorry.

454
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Am I a man?

455
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
He said,

456
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I'm sorry.

457
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Yoshida's way of doing things is to fight.

458
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
He is trying to break the balance of the ship.

459
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
This is the dirty part.

460
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Katsura and Yasushikiyoshi were fighting.

461
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
They were trying to break the balance of the ship.

462
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
They were trying to break the balance of the ship.

463
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
This is Yoshida's way of doing things.

464
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
He is a good talker.

465
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
He doesn't have anything.

466
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
He has this much.

467
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
This is a strange company.

468
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Let's do our best.

469
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I don't have a rival in Yoshida.

470
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
This is hard.

471
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
In the company?

472
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Yes.

473
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
When Katsura and Yasushikiyoshi are fighting,

474
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Yasushikiyoshi goes like this.

475
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I won't lose.

476
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I'm angry.

477
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I'm angry.

478
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Yasushikiyoshi is trying hard.

479
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Then, Katsura goes like this.

480
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Then, he goes like this.

481
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Then, he goes like this.

482
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
If you can do it, come to us.

483
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
You did a special, right?

484
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Yes, I did.

485
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
It was like that.

486
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
It was a share 79.

487
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
It was long.

488
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
In the middle of the night.

489
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
The rating was amazing.

490
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
It was 1.2.

491
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
How was it?

492
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
It was amazing.

493
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I see.

494
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,000
I haven't done any events.

495
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I've done a lot of things.

496
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,000
I've been preparing for Taisho Denoka.

497
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
I haven't done anything like that lately.

498
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
You haven't done anything?

499
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,000
You have to do it little by little.

500
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I was told to do it little by little.

501
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I couldn't do it.

502
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,000
You were told to do it little by little.

503
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
You said, I'll do it.

504
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
I was the only one who played the punishment game.

505
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Why?

506
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Hamada's bashing got me angry.

507
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Why?

508
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
I don't remember the words.

509
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
I did a lot of things.

510
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
You said you were going to do something.

511
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Do you have a letter?

512
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
It's coming.

513
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
It's coming.

514
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
A hat.

515
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Toilet paper.

516
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
A doll.

517
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
A stuffed animal.

518
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
A stuffed animal that looks like you.

519
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Yes.

520
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Well...

521
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Good morning.

522
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Lucky.

523
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
You were lucky, weren't you?

524
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Yes.

525
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Look at the camera.

526
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
You were lucky, weren't you?

527
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
When you came out,

528
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
an old lady came running to you.

529
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Thank you for your luck.

530
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Is that true?

531
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Is that true?

532
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
A pig old lady.

533
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Isn't that young?

534
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
She said thank you to her daughter.

535
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
She said she was surprised.

536
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
I see.

537
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
If she knew, she wouldn't have done it.

538
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Look.

539
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
What are you doing?

540
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
What?

541
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Can't you see?

542
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
What?

543
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Jogi.

544
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Jogi.

545
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
I have many assistants.

546
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I write questions.

547
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
I write letters.

548
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
I have many assistants.

549
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
We are all the same.

550
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Please come here often.

551
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
I'm looking forward to it.

552
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Lucky's Skyline.

553
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
See you next week.

554
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Bye.
