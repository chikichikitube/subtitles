1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Chikichiki Shinshun Daishinrenkai!

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm the host of this program, Chikichiki Shinshun Daishinrenkai!

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'm Yomesaki Hosei!

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I'm the producer of this program.

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm Kenji Suga!

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm here to give you a wink!

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
What do you mean by a wink?

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Don't mess with me!

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Today, we have a new year's party.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Unfortunately, it's not a break-up.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It's a break-up.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I hope you'll enjoy it.

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Thank you.

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'd like to have a toast, a greeting, and a mirror break-up from the people of Downtown.

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
The atmosphere is still very bad.

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
If I say anything here, I'll end up like that.

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'll have to make it up to you.

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
As Mr. Suga said, it's not a break-up at all.

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
That's strange.

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
It's not a break-up at all.

21
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
That's very harsh.

22
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Anyway, thank you all for coming.

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Thank you for having us.

24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Thank you for coming.

25
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Cheers!

26
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Everyone, the food is in front of you.

27
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Please take your time to judge.

28
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
This program is brought to you by these sponsors.

29
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
This year marks the 10th anniversary of the Gaki no Tsukai Korei.

30
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
The atmosphere is just as calm as usual.

31
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Congratulations on the 10th anniversary.

32
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Meanwhile, Tanaka greets Hamada.

33
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I'm your junior.

34
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Nice to meet you.

35
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Don't cry.

36
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I'm your junior.

37
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
It's Tanaka! Everyone, gather around!

38
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Tanaka's prank from last week, which received a lot of feedback.

39
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:35,000
This is a prank that Tanaka does on his own, but Hamada can't stop crying.

40
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Stop! Stop!

41
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Tanaka was so scared of Hamada's acting that he started crying.

42
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
No way!

43
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Did you think he was going to cry?

44
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
No, I didn't.

45
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I talked to the young comedians.

46
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
They all said he was going to cry.

47
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
That was the first time I saw it on air.

48
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
It was so fast when I hit him.

49
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Everyone was like, wow!

50
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
You were laughing when you came out, right?

51
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I wasn't laughing.

52
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Matsumoto was laughing.

53
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I was laughing, but it didn't make sense.

54
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I can't do a prank today.

55
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I can't bring a prank from here.

56
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I'm in!

57
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I'll never forget Tanaka's face no matter how many times I see him.

58
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
The second episode!

59
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
We can't use the kids, so we're going to use them!

60
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Shinshun Owarai New Wave Manzai Dairase!

61
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:52,000
From now on, we're going to draw lots with 20 staff members.

62
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
We're going to have a manzai game of 5 teams.

63
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
First, we're going to draw lots for the numbers.

64
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
The manzai game was popular last year.

65
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Everyone drew lots while hoping that they would be eliminated.

66
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
If the number drawn here comes out in the next roulette,

67
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
we'll have to perform a manzai on stage.

68
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
First!

69
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
The first team!

70
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
It's one-twenty.

71
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Number 6!

72
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Who's number 6?

73
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
It's Aotani!

74
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
It's Aotani!

75
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I'd like you to push your opponent.

76
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
If you push him, you'll get hit in the head.

77
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Stop!

78
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I'm counting on you.

79
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Number 10!

80
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
But it looks like...

81
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
It's Ron Gaze!

82
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
It's Ron Gaze!

83
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
The second team is...

84
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I'm counting on you.

85
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Number 11!

86
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
It's Tanaka!

87
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
If you get hit by a strong guy, you'll get hit here.

88
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I'm counting on you.

89
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Let's go!

90
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Stop it!

91
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
It's Takasu!

92
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
It wasn't Aotani this year!

93
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
The third team!

94
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I want to run away.

95
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Number 13!

96
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Who is it?

97
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
It's Uwabaki!

98
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
It's Uwabaki!

99
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I'm counting on you.

100
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Thank you.

101
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
It's me!

102
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
It's Uwabaki!

103
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
He's the best!

104
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Then it's either Uwabaki or Motoi.

105
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I'm counting on you.

106
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I want that one.

107
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Last year, you were pretty good.

108
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Matsumoto, you didn't get hit in the head.

109
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Will I get hit?

110
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I'm counting on you.

111
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I'm counting on you.

112
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Number 10!

113
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,000
It's Fujiwara!

114
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Who is Nakamura's partner?

115
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
It's Fujiwara!

116
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
There's only one team left!

117
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
There's only one team left.

118
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Who will be the first one?

119
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Number 11!

120
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
And the last roulette!

121
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Number 4!

122
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
That's the end of the fifth team!

123
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Yes!

124
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Thank you!

125
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
It's me this year!

126
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
You're crazy!

127
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Let's go to the last one!

128
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
This is the end.

129
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I'm sorry.

130
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Let's go!

131
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Number 18!

132
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Yes.

133
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
It's Matsumoto!

134
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Matsumoto!

135
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
The god of comedy is here!

136
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I'm so excited!

137
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
It's Matsumoto's turn!

138
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
It's Irie!

139
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
It's Irie again!

140
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Number 5!

141
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:28,000
That's it!

142
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
This is it!

143
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
The other six teams are exhausted.

144
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Yamazaki will decide the topic.

145
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
First, Adachi Saito's long A's is distraught.

146
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Next, Sanaka Takasu's handy honnit challenge.

147
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
And Hamada Sakamoto's diet movie Titanic.

148
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Nakamura Fujiwara's health is on the rise.

149
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Otomo Endo's challenge is to catch the most difficult fish.

150
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
And the last one, Sugawa Matsumoto, is determined to be in the digital society.

151
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
It's a big hit in the commercial industry!

152
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
They are moving to a different room.

153
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Even though it's a party, they have their own sense of humor.

154
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
There will be a careful talk show.

155
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
There are four kinds of food.

156
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
There are four kinds of food.

157
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
There are four kinds of food.

158
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Now, let's introduce the first team.

159
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
They are Hamada and Uwawaki from downtown.

160
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Their team name is Titanic.

161
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I'm Uwawaki.

162
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I'm Misabaki.

163
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
We are...

164
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Geta Mako!

165
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Yeah!

166
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
That's how it is.

167
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Nice to meet you.

168
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Yesterday...

169
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
May I?

170
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Of course.

171
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
What do you mean?

172
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Yesterday...

173
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I watched Titanic.

174
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
You watched Titanic yesterday?

175
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
That's too late.

176
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
It was a big hit last year.

177
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
It just came out in the video.

178
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
You shouldn't watch it in the video.

179
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
You should watch it in the cinema.

180
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
You should watch it in the cinema.

181
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Why?

182
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
The cinema is close.

183
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,000
There are two or three cinemas next to the cinema.

184
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
You should watch it in the cinema!

185
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
What are you talking about?

186
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
You should watch it in the cinema.

187
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
You should watch it in the cinema.

188
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,000
There were a lot of famous scenes in Titanic.

189
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
There were a lot.

190
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
No matter what...

191
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
What kind of scenes were there?

192
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
First of all...

193
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
On the battlefield...

194
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
The scene where two people's love is gradually connected.

195
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
The scene of spitting.

196
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
There was a scene like that.

197
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
It's a little dirty.

198
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
There was a scene like that.

199
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
What was it like?

200
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Watch it.

201
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
What are you doing?

202
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Why are you spitting in front of the audience?

203
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
No, there were other scenes.

204
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
There were more.

205
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
There were more, right?

206
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
There were more.

207
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
What kind of scenes were there?

208
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
The scene of spitting on the battlefield.

209
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
What are you talking about?

210
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
It's dirty.

211
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
What are you talking about?

212
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
That was a while ago.

213
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
There were other scenes.

214
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Famous scenes.

215
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
What other scenes were there?

216
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
There was a scene of spitting on the battlefield.

217
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
There was a scene of spitting on the battlefield.

218
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
This is...

219
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
What is this?

220
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
What is this?

221
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Rose.

222
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Rose.

223
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Rose.

224
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Rose.

225
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
There was a scene where Rose and Rose dance together.

226
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
It was a scene that looked fun.

227
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Let's try it.

228
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Wait a minute.

229
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Don't laugh.

230
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Don't laugh.

231
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Don't laugh.

232
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Don't laugh.

233
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Are you okay?

234
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
There were other scenes.

235
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Speaking of Titanic.

236
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Speaking of Titanic.

237
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Famous scenes that must not be forgotten.

238
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
What kind of scenes were there?

239
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
That's it.

240
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
That's it.

241
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
This is Titanic.

242
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
This is it.

243
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
That was good.

244
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
That was good.

245
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
That was good.

246
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Let's try it.

247
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Let's try it.

248
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Close your eyes.

249
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Believe in me.

250
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I believe in you.

251
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Don't drop it.

252
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Thank you.

253
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
The second episode is...

254
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Long Gaze.

255
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
The theme is restaurant.

256
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Here you go.

257
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Thank you.

258
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Thank you.

259
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I'm Adachi.

260
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I'm Penpo.

261
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Long Gaze with the two of us.

262
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
It's a bad time right now.

263
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
It's a bad time.

264
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Salaries are being cut off.

265
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
There's a restaurant.

266
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
There's no way to make money in one shot.

267
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
That's good.

268
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
When it comes to money...

269
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Bank coat.

270
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Bank coat.

271
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
That's good.

272
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Let's go to this bank.

273
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Let's go.

274
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
It seems to be a bank.

275
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Let's go.

276
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Wait a minute.

277
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
What?

278
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I need to pee.

279
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I need to go to the toilet.

280
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
We're going to the bank now.

281
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Even if you go to the toilet, you'll be suspected.

282
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I got it.

283
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I'm going to pee.

284
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Let's look forward to it.

285
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Tanaka and Takasu.

286
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
The theme is handy-hand.

287
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Thank you.

288
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Hello.

289
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I'm Tanaka.

290
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I'm Takasu.

291
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
The two of us.

292
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Tanaka and Takasu.

293
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
You stay there.

294
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Go home.

295
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
What should I do?

296
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Go home.

297
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Go home.

298
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Go home.

299
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I'm Tanaka.

300
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I'm Takasu.

301
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
The two of us.

302
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Tanaka and Takasu.

303
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
You're the opposite.

304
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
What should I do?

305
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I don't care about the convenience store.

306
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I think now.

307
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Yes.

308
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Many things are popular.

309
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Do you know what's the most popular?

310
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Cell phone.

311
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Cell phone.

312
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
What are you doing?

313
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I have a cell phone.

314
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Don't say that.

315
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Cell phones are the most popular now.

316
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Yes.

317
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
One, two, three, four.

318
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Some people have it.

319
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
That's right.

320
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Do you have a cell phone?

321
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I have it.

322
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
That's right.

323
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I have a cell phone.

324
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Let's try it.

325
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Yes.

326
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
You are slow.

327
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Please do it faster.

328
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
You should have said that.

329
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
You should have done that.

330
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Don't be so fast.

331
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Okay.

332
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
You're too fast.

333
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
We haven't pressed the button yet.

334
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
It's not possible.

335
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
We haven't pressed the button yet.

336
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
What is it?

337
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
You're always angry.

338
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
What a guy.

339
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
You always say that.

340
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
What is it?

341
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
You should have done it at a good timing.

342
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
We're too fast.

343
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
That's too much. Just do it normally.

344
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Okay, I'll do it normally.

345
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Are you a fax machine?

346
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
You're not a fax machine, are you?

347
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Don't say I'm a fool!

348
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Don't say I'm a fool in front of the audience.

349
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I heard there's a song called Chakumelo.

350
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Chakushin Melody will play it for you.

351
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
There's a song called Smapp.

352
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
There's a song called Amuro-chan.

353
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Amuro-chan is in my song.

354
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
You're Amuro-chan and you're a Chakumelo.

355
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Let's listen to it.

356
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Sing it!

357
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
You can't sing it, can you?

358
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
You can't sing Chakumelo.

359
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
But it's a melody.

360
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
What should I do?

361
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I don't know what to do.

362
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
It's a melody, so it's weird to sing it.

363
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
It's better to be more calm.

364
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
If you're Japanese, you can sing Enka.

365
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Enka is fine.

366
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Let's go with Enka.

367
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Please.

368
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
It's good, isn't it?

369
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
It's good.

370
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
It's good, isn't it?

371
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
That's why you can't sing it.

372
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
You can't sing it.

373
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
What should I do?

374
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
It's Enka.

375
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
You can't sing Enka.

376
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
It's Chakumelo.

377
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Please.

378
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
It's good.

379
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
It's good.

380
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
You can't sing it.

381
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
You can't sing it.

382
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
That was a great ending.

383
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,000
The fourth group is Endo-san and Otomo-san.

384
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
The theme is Masu.

385
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Please take care of them.

386
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Hello.

387
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
It's time for physical education.

388
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
One, two.

389
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
One, two.

390
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Please.

391
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Let's do our best.

392
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
It's been a year.

393
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I'm thinking of finding a hobby this year.

394
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I'm thinking of finding a hobby this year.

395
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
My hobby is fishing.

396
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Fishing.

397
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Fishing is good.

398
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I fished for a bus.

399
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I caught a fish and threw it.

400
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
The moment I caught a fish, I felt good.

401
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
You should find a hobby.

402
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I'm doing it too.

403
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Fishing.

404
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Do you have a hobby?

405
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Please tell me what your hobby is.

406
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Fishing for a bus.

407
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
It's different.

408
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I'm not alone.

409
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I'm moved.

410
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I'm moved.

411
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I was really moved when I caught a fish.

412
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I'm moved because of it.

413
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
You are not moved, right?

414
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I feel moved.

415
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
This is the first time in a week.

416
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Masu, please.

417
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I'm moved because of it.

418
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I'm moved because of it.

419
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:02,000
The most moving thing was the 38th win in Yokohama.

420
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,600
Sasaki, the great Sasaki, the hulk ball, this hulk ball is amazing.

421
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:09,200
No one can hit that hulk ball.

422
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,600
I've never returned that hulk.

423
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,500
What? Who is that hulk?

424
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,900
My mom throws a better hulk.

425
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:14,800
Why?

426
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,800
My mom throws a better hulk.

427
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,700
Don't call me mom. Don't talk to me like that.

428
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:22,400
Mom, can you throw a hulk?

429
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,300
What kind of hulk is it?

430
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:25,200
My dad's son stabbed me with this.

431
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:30,200
That hulk is dangerous. What are you going to do?

432
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:33,100
Don't make fun of me. You're really amazing.

433
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:36,800
But the other thing that moved me was the championship interview.

434
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:39,100
That was so moving. It's been 38 years.

435
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:40,200
Didn't that move you?

436
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,600
I can do that.

437
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,200
There's no way you can.

438
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,700
I'll make everyone moved.

439
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:46,000
You're going to make everyone moved?

440
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:46,900
I'm counting on you.

441
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:48,600
He's returned after 38 years.

442
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,800
He's a Yokohama-based star.

443
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:53,100
Please tell us how you feel right now.

444
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:57,800
Who do you want to tell how you feel right now?

445
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:01,700
How do you want to fight in the Japan Series?

446
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,900
You're the one who's going to be moved.

447
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:05,900
You shouldn't be the only one who's going to be moved.

448
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:08,400
I'm not talking about the championship interview.

449
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,400
The championship interview is like the catch ball in a conversation.

450
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,400
Catch the ball. Let's do the catch ball properly.

451
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,400
Just baseball.

452
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,800
That's enough. Thank you very much.

453
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:20,600
I was surprised.

454
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,600
Let's go to the 5th team.

455
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:25,600
I want you to do your best in the 5th team.

456
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,000
There are two newbies.

457
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,800
Bafun and Fujiwara.

458
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:30,800
Please take care of them.

459
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,200
I'm Fujiwara-kun.

460
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,800
I'm Nakamura-kun.

461
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:40,800
Please take care of them.

462
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,800
I'm Nakamura-kun.

463
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:43,800
Please take care of them.

464
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,800
I'm Fujiwara-kun.

465
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,800
Please take care of them.

466
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:50,800
This year is fast.

467
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,800
Yes, it's fast.

468
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:55,800
It's like January.

469
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:58,800
I'm 36 years old this year.

470
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:02,800
36? 36 means...

471
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:03,800
What is it?

472
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,800
Don't lie to me.

473
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,800
I know.

474
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,800
I'm 36.

475
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,800
36 means...

476
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:15,800
I don't know. I'm 39.

477
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:16,800
Why?

478
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,800
What kind of calculation are you doing?

479
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,800
Let's go to the last team.

480
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:29,800
Matsumoto and Sugade.

481
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,800
This is a digital society.

482
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:38,800
Matsumoto and Sugade.

483
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:41,800
This is a digital society.

484
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,800
Hello, everyone.

485
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,800
Happy New Year.

486
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,800
What is there to be happy about?

487
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,800
What are you doing?

488
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,800
Aren't you greeting the audience?

489
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:04,800
What are you angry about?

490
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:05,800
I'm very angry.

491
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,800
What are you angry about?

492
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,800
First of all, January 1st.

493
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,800
It's New Year's Day.

494
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,800
What's going on in New Year's Day?

495
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:16,800
The number of mobile phone calls has increased by 11 digits.

496
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,800
It has increased by 11 digits.

497
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,800
How about 090?

498
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,800
How about 070?

499
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,800
It's complicated.

500
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,800
I'm responsible for it.

501
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,800
I'm angry.

502
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:33,800
Speaking of which, Osaka where we live.

503
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:34,800
Osaka.

504
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:35,800
The number of phone calls has increased.

505
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,800
It's said that six numbers have increased.

506
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,800
It's said that six numbers have increased.

507
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,800
It's said that seven numbers have increased.

508
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,800
I can't remember.

509
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:46,800
I understand, but I can't help it.

510
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,800
The number of postcards has increased.

511
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:49,800
The number of postcards has increased.

512
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:50,800
Seven digits.

513
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,800
How about 104?

514
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,800
How about 105?

515
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:55,800
It's complicated.

516
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:58,800
I'm responsible for it.

517
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,800
I'm responsible for it.

518
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:03,800
I can't speak.

519
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,800
I can't speak.

520
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,800
I can't speak.

521
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,800
The number of postcards has increased.

522
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:13,800
What's increasing?

523
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:14,800
First, the number of hair.

524
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,800
The number of hair has increased.

525
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,800
It has increased by one or two digits.

526
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:19,800
It has increased by three digits.

527
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,800
It has increased by 11 digits.

528
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,800
It's dangerous.

529
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:26,800
And you.

530
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,800
Sports is the J-League.

531
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,800
There is J-League?

532
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:31,800
It's increased by 20 digits.

533
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:32,800
You mean 20 people?

534
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:33,800
What do you mean?

535
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:34,800
20 balls.

536
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,800
What the hell are you talking about?

537
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,800
The current popular talent, SMAP.

538
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,800
Don't make fun of me.

539
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,800
I'm sorry.

540
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:45,800
SMAP.

541
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:46,800
There will be more members.

542
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,800
There are five of us, but how many are there?

543
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:49,800
There are six of us.

544
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:50,800
Six?

545
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:51,800
Who will be added?

546
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:52,800
Mori will be added.

547
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,800
Don't make fun of me.

548
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:57,800
Is it okay to make fun of me?

549
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:58,800
Yes.

550
00:22:58,800 --> 00:22:59,800
And you.

551
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:00,800
Yes.

552
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,800
The most difficult thing is the number of signals.

553
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:03,800
What is the number of signals?

554
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:04,800
Three colors are four colors.

555
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:05,800
What color will increase?

556
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:06,800
Gray.

557
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:10,800
What should we do if the driver and the pedestrian become gray?

558
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:11,800
Do you want to go to Ishikawa-chika?

559
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,800
Go to Ishikawa-chika.

560
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,800
Don't say no.

561
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:16,800
What is it?

562
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,800
I've been telling you a lot of things that will increase.

563
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,800
I've been telling you a lot of things that will increase.

564
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,800
There are things that will increase and things that will decrease.

565
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:23,800
There are things that will decrease.

566
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:24,800
What is it?

567
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:28,800
The number of people who can laugh has decreased.

568
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,800
You are so excited.

569
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:31,800
What the hell is this?

570
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:33,800
Make it as a painting.

571
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:34,800
This burnt tennis ball.

572
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:35,800
Grandma, I accept it.

573
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,800
I was deceived by Takas.

574
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,800
I should have said a little more.

575
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,800
But he said it was interesting.

576
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,800
I couldn't do anything.

577
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:56,800
It was interesting, wasn't it?

578
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,800
Aikata-san's voice isn't coming out.

579
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,800
No, Aikata-san is...

580
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:05,800
I was rehearsing at around 4 and a half o'clock.

581
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,800
My voice wasn't coming out.

582
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:11,800
The first time I spoke, my voice wasn't coming out.

583
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:24,800
This program was brought to you by these sponsors.
