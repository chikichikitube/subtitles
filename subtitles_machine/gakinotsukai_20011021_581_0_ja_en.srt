1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Before the show, the kids are excited.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Let's do it!

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Today is the day of the badminton tournament.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
This show is different from the past.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Today is a little amazing.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
If you get one point, you can get one prize.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Really?

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
This too?

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Does that matter?

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
This is also a problem.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I didn't spend any money before, so I'm doing it here.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I think I should definitely do it.

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I'll do it.

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
But the wind is strong.

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
It's difficult to do.

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Mr. Kama said he didn't want to do it today.

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Why?

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Why?

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I have a fever.

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
A fever?

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Yes.

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
How did you get on the bus in May, which is 42 times?

23
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
It was not like that.

24
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Suddenly?

25
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Yes.

26
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I was stuck in the bus.

27
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I want you to go.

28
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I want you to go.

29
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm a salaryman.

30
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm often with salarymen.

31
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'll do my best.

32
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Is that Mr. Hamau?

33
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Yes.

34
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
He's there.

35
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
He's there.

36
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'm going to do it.

37
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
How was it on the other show?

38
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Let's do it.

39
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Look at the products.

40
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
It's very luxurious.

41
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Cars, bikes, 1 million yen.

42
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
If you get 1 point, you can get 1 product.

43
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I don't want to do it.

44
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I don't feel like doing it anymore.

45
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I don't feel like doing it since last month.

46
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Last month?

47
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
No, last month.

48
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Last month?

49
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
No, last month.

50
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
May?

51
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
May.

52
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
No, last month.

53
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
May.

54
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
May.

55
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I don't feel like doing it.

56
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I'm tired.

57
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
No, no, I'm not tired.

58
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I want to go home.

59
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I don't feel like doing it anymore.

60
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I'm tired of doing it.

61
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I don't know who you are.

62
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
You're not motivated?

63
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
No, no, no.

64
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
No, no, no.

65
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
You're not motivated.

66
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
What are you talking about?

67
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
What are you doing?

68
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

69
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Hey, hey, hey.

70
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
You're not motivated.

71
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I was told to go to the nearest hospital.

72
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
What kind of hospital?

73
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Let's go outside.

74
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I can't go outside.

75
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
The tragedy that attacked Hamada.

76
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Is it really that difficult to get a heart attack?

77
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
We can't record it like this.

78
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
What kind of stupid plan is this?

79
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I wanted to do this with Minto.

80
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
This is a spiritual thing.

81
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Do you want to do it with four people?

82
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
But the viewer will wonder why.

83
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
That's right.

84
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
What is it?

85
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Why is the teacher so?

86
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:37,000
At the time of other projects, why is it like this?

87
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
That's right.

88
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Good morning.

89
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Good morning.

90
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Oh, you surprised me.

91
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
That's right.

92
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
That's right.

93
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
You surprised me.

94
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
How are you?

95
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Good morning.

96
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I came to the meeting for the concert.

97
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Oh, really?

98
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I thought you won.

99
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Oh, really?

100
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I'm planning to use the bag.

101
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
But it's kind of dark.

102
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
It's a bit heavy.

103
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I was thinking about playing badminton.

104
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
But I had a problem.

105
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Hama-chan?

106
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Yes, it's Hama-chan.

107
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I have something to tell you.

108
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I have a disease.

109
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I don't know what to do.

110
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Can I tell you?

111
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Yes, you can.

112
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,000
If you have any questions, please feel free to ask.

113
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
No, no, no.

114
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I'm really sorry.

115
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I'll just leave it there.

116
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I have to go to a meeting.

117
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I'm late.

118
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Excuse me.

119
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Thank you for your time.

120
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I was surprised.

121
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I was surprised.

122
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I see.

123
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Even though the appearance of Yoki-Sem Nobuchi, there is no island that is surprised by them now.

124
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:15,000
To measure the early resolution of the situation, together with the program producer, they return to Hamada.

125
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Wait a minute.

126
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Do not you do?

127
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
It will end soon. It is the usual pattern of badminton.

128
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
No, I have a little feeling.

129
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
May.

130
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
May?

131
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
What is 5 months?

132
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
It's not even 42 months.

133
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
It's a disease that makes you a new employee.

134
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
A new employee?

135
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
What month is it?

136
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
The month before the war.

137
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Masaru Shiga wasn't caught either.

138
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
It's like that every time.

139
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Yes, I've tried it.

140
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
It's terrible.

141
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
You should go home.

142
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I will.

143
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Look, look.

144
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Mr. Hamada, you're over 40.

145
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Go home.

146
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Mr. Isaka, you should go home.

147
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I can't help it.

148
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
You're acting like a young comedian.

149
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I'm sorry.

150
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I said too much.

151
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I'm sorry.

152
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I'm sorry.

153
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Go home.

154
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Go home.

155
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
What?

156
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
What is this?

157
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:28,000
In the recording, Hamada, who has been accused of being responsible for the show,

158
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
will be in danger of losing the show.

159
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
What will be the solution?

160
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
What should I do?

161
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Are you okay?

162
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Is your head okay?

163
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
But it hurts, right?

164
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
It was painful.

165
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
It was painful to watch the young comedian.

166
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
He was saying, Batchkon.

167
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I think it's impossible to talk about it.

168
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
It's impossible.

169
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
It's impossible to talk about it.

170
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I think only badminton players can talk about it.

171
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
That's right.

172
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
What's wrong?

173
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Can I take a picture?

174
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Yes.

175
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
You can take a picture.

176
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I'm curious about it.

177
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
But he is an academician, right?

178
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Yes.

179
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
The atmosphere is different.

180
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
To be honest, I can't do what I'm trying to do now.

181
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
You can't do it yet.

182
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
No progress.

183
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
No progress.

184
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
If that's the case, it's a beautiful power, but...

185
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
The ship that was about to board.

186
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Even if I go home and get scolded by Yuri,

187
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Yuri will...

188
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I know.

189
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
What?

190
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Yuri is...

191
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
The judge of the soccer team.

192
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
The one who has the A-class license.

193
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
The one who has the license for the nutritionist.

194
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
The one who makes mistakes.

195
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
My wife.

196
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
We have the same child.

197
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,000
So if you don't mind, if you don't have any other ideas, I can talk to you.

198
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
No, no, no.

199
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
If it's something unnecessary, I'm sorry.

200
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
No, it's not unnecessary.

201
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
If it's not, I can try it.

202
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I'm a senior in the entertainment industry.

203
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I may be a little harsh on you.

204
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
You should have told me.

205
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
There are good times.

206
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
You can do that.

207
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I'm sorry.

208
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I can't do anything.

209
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
If you do it, I'm sorry if I can't help you.

210
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
No, no, no.

211
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I'm sorry.

212
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I'll do my best.

213
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Nomuchi is convinced by Hamada.

214
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I'm sorry if I didn't help you.

215
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
No, no, no.

216
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I'm really sorry.

217
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Please.

218
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I'll do it if I have to.

219
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
It's better for us to get closer.

220
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
That's right.

221
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I think it's better to leave it to the crew.

222
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
What's wrong?

223
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I just happened to be here.

224
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,500
Yes.

225
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,000
I was just...

226
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Umm...

227
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I just came by.

228
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Oh, I see.

229
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Are you feeling alright?

230
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Umm...

231
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I guess so.

232
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I'm not in the mood.

233
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
You're more of a fan than we thought.

234
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I guess so.

235
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Masao is a senior.

236
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I guess so.

237
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I don't know if it's been a year, but I'm sorry to say this, but I like you.

238
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I said it, but you know what I mean, right?

239
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I'm sorry I'm late.

240
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:09,000
It's strange to say that I've been doing this for years, but I really like you.

241
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I thought it was a good time to tell him this.

242
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
He is a cheerful and cheerful person.

243
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
That's amazing.

244
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
He is like a big brother.

245
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I was able to exercise for free.

246
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
And later I was offered a job.

247
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I'm grateful for this job.

248
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
And the audience is happy with it.

249
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
What are you talking about?

250
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
It's a long story.

251
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
It's hard to say.

252
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I think you can only see yourself now.

253
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Look around you.

254
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
There are many painful things.

255
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Yamazaki, Tanaka, Endo.

256
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
They are painful.

257
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
What is painful? Their existence.

258
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
It's hard to not realize that we're suffering.

259
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
You can see that, right?

260
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
So, you know...

261
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Life is only once.

262
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
It's a one-way trip.

263
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Let's go!

264
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
With all our might!

265
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Let's do our best!

266
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
That's all I can do.

267
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
life goes on

268
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:34,380
yamato

269
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:08,380
I loved to search for it

270
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:13,380
When I closed my heart to sadness

271
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:18,380
The flowers in the flower shop changed too

272
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:27,380
In my town, just one more time

273
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:32,380
Would you like to drink hot coffee?

274
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:38,380
I was asked at that shop

275
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:47,380
Why are you doing this?

276
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:23,380
Is our love over?

277
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:29,380
The seasons have changed too

278
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:37,380
You came to visit my room

279
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:42,380
And you were always cleaning

280
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:54,380
I don't know either, why are you here?

281
00:13:57,380 --> 00:14:08,380
The town is filled with people shopping, soon it will be lit red

282
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:22,380
I'm avoiding people today, I'm just going home, just by myself

283
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:33,380
Without being able to cross the bridge, why are you here?

284
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:55,900
Belfour

285
00:14:55,900 --> 00:15:00,900
I'll just go home, all alone

286
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:12,900
I'm waiting for you, who can't even touch my feet

287
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,900
I'm sorry.

288
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,900
I'm sorry.

289
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:37,900
How was it? Did you feel like you were a good audience?

290
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,900
You don't know, do you?

291
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:42,900
I can't say anything at this point.

292
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:43,900
You can't say anything.

293
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:44,900
I can't say anything.

294
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:48,900
Excuse me, your glasses are too hard.

295
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:51,900
You have a lot of glasses.

296
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:53,900
You have glasses.

297
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:54,900
Glasses?

298
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:56,900
Are you going to die?

299
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:57,900
Something is coming out.

300
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:00,900
It's going to die.

301
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:03,900
Which one? Which one?

302
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:04,900
This one. This one. This one.

303
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,900
This is amazing.

304
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:08,900
This is all stress.

305
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:12,900
In short, the world is full of fools.

306
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:16,900
Every time I meet a fool, I get a cramp.

307
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:18,900
I can't fix it.

308
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:23,900
When I'm in the car, I'm waiting for someone to call me on my cell phone.

309
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:27,900
I'm calling you from a place that's not a big street.

310
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:30,900
Then the opposite lane comes from the other side.

311
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:34,900
If I stop here, I'll stop here.

312
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:38,900
That idiot Saka Gen is a fool.

313
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:42,900
If you do that, I'll be half as bad.

314
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:44,900
Why?

315
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:50,900
If you let me go, I'll be like this.

316
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:55,900
I'll take 50% of your stupidity.

317
00:16:55,900 --> 00:17:00,900
If someone who doesn't know comes, I'll be like, why are you here?

318
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:02,900
I was the only one who was in the back.

319
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:04,900
Me?

320
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,900
And then from the back, this part was all...

321
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,900
It was all...

322
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:10,900
I see.

323
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,900
I was like, I'm getting one, I'm getting half.

324
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:16,900
But the one who stopped by my side wasn't a Puku.

325
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:18,900
It wasn't. I gave them all to you.

326
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:20,900
They were all coming to me.

327
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:24,900
It was like, I was forced to carry one by a smelly, dirty shit.

328
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,900
That's not it.

329
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:28,900
Until now it was Puku.

330
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:30,900
I'm just kidding.

331
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:32,900
I'm just kidding.

332
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,900
You're all so stupid.

333
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:36,900
I want to change that.

334
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,900
Can I be the mayor?

335
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,900
Please.

336
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:42,900
I want to change the most.

337
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,900
The parking lot at the intersection.

338
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,900
The parking lot of the car.

339
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,900
I want to make all of them 1 meter behind.

340
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,900
I want to make all of them 1 meter behind.

341
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,900
I want to make all of them 1 meter behind.

342
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,900
I can't turn when I come.

343
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,900
I can't turn when I come.

344
00:17:56,900 --> 00:18:02,900
Okappa, you idiot!

345
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:06,900
Okappa?

346
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,900
Okappa, okappa!

347
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:16,900
Next month, I have a question for Matsumoto Residen's upcoming book.

348
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:17,900
I have a question.

349
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:22,900
You were a gorilla when you were in the third grade of elementary school.

350
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:26,900
Why did you change to a hippo when you were in the fourth grade?

351
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:29,900
If I were a gorilla, I would have been called a moth.

352
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,900
I don't know what you are talking about.

353
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:34,900
You are a gorilla, so you are not calling me a moth.

354
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:36,900
I can't say it at all.

355
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,900
Say it properly.

356
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,900
I am a moth.

357
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,900
Say it properly.

358
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:45,900
Is this your first car?

359
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,900
I think I bought it for the first time.

360
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:49,900
I think I bought it for the first time.

361
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:51,900
I bought it for 10,000 yen before that.

362
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,900
Starlet.

363
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,900
I'm not a gorilla.

364
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,900
That's strange.

365
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,900
Why did you quit Starlet?

366
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:01,900
I'm tired of it.

367
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:03,900
I'm tired of Gorilla.

368
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:05,900
I'm tired of the law.

369
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,900
I'm tired of the law.

370
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:09,900
You knew it from the beginning.

371
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,900
No.

372
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,900
Cars are a means of transportation to the scene.

373
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,900
I was a member of the Gorilla Corps.

374
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,900
You were a member of the Gorilla Corps?

375
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,900
Yes, I was. I was a member of the 5th number.

376
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,900
I didn't care about anything else.

377
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,900
I was a member of the 5th number.

378
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,900
What did you do when you went to school?

379
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,900
I waited for the Gorilla Corps.

380
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,900
I was waiting for the Gorilla Corps.

381
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,900
Where did you wait for the Gorilla Corps?

382
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,900
I waited for the Churinjyo.

383
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:37,900
I waited for the Gorilla Corps.

384
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:39,900
Why do you say that again?

385
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,900
You should have said that at the beginning.

386
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:43,900
I do the Japanese style stop motion.

387
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:45,900
In my case, the gorilla was facing this way.

388
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:48,900
If you get in the way, the gorilla is facing this way.

389
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:51,900
After that, the gorilla does this.

390
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:55,900
No, no, no.

391
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:57,900
From the beginning, the gorilla does this.

392
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,900
Gorillas always do this.

393
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,900
There are times like this.

394
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:04,900
I usually...

395
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:05,900
No, no, no.

396
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:06,900
Hey, get out!

397
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,900
Fanto, whoů

398
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:09,900
Letů

399
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,900
Just a minuteů

400
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,900
Do not!

401
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:18,900
Have the power to overcome to me and push me machine!

402
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,900
Counter is boring!

403
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:22,900
So,if you wille mow down here.

404
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:24,900
Now after finishing lesson.

405
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,900
I can ln the veins...

406
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:29,900
OKů

407
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:33,900
It is also possible to go around because of gorilla.

408
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:34,900
Always like thatů

409
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,900
Can you suppress that in 3 years?

410
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,900
It's different from Mk.II

411
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:39,900
Right?

412
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:40,900
What do you do?

413
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:42,900
That's my hobby

414
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:46,900
My hobby is to share

415
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:48,900
Share?

416
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:52,900
Do you live with him?

417
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:56,900
Yes, it was hard

418
00:20:56,900 --> 00:21:00,900
But I'm getting bad energy

419
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:03,900
This is interesting

420
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:07,900
I was the first one who ran with only one banana.

421
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:11,900
You were like, one banana!

422
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:15,900
So I changed my cover.

423
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:16,900
Because the fuel was bad?

424
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:17,900
Yes.

425
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:21,900
But I had ETC.

426
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:24,900
You were in the fourth grade?

427
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:28,900
You changed your ride in the second grade.

428
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:30,900
I wasn't in the second grade.

429
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,900
ETC is...

430
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:33,900
That's right.

431
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:39,900
What? You're just saying it randomly.

432
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,900
Stop with the chest thumping!

433
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:49,900
I would say that if you meet a bear, pretend you're dead.

434
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:53,900
What is the best way to deal with aliens?

435
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:54,900
Ah...

436
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:56,900
No, no, no.

437
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:57,900
What?

438
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,900
You've never met an alien, have you?

439
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:04,900
There is that woman in the area, Shigani Weaver.

440
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:07,900
You have to make it clear that it's not her.

441
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:10,900
It's not Shigani.

442
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:13,900
I'm not Shigani.

443
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:15,900
First of all...

444
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:18,900
When you meet her in the area...

445
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:21,900
When I meet her in the area, I'm not Shigani.

446
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:24,900
In the area, you only go to Shigani.

447
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:25,900
You don't aim for Shigani.

448
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:26,900
I don't know.

449
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:30,900
But, to be clear, I'm not Shigani.

450
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:35,900
If I don't say it out loud, he'll come in like this.

451
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:38,900
He'll come in like this.

452
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:41,900
He seems to be purring.

453
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:45,900
I'm not Shigani.

454
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:50,900
When I say Shigani, he'll start to talk.

455
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:56,900
If it's Shigani, it means that it's definitely Shigani.

456
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:58,900
Where are you looking at?

457
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,900
From the inside of my mouth.

458
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:02,900
Is this Shigani?

459
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,900
That's a stuffed animal.

460
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:07,900
What are you doing?

461
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:10,900
Why are you lying down?

462
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:12,900
This is Shigani.

463
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:13,900
It's easy.

464
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:18,900
First of all, if you say it's not Shigani, they'll think it's Shigani.

465
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,900
What are you going to do?

466
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,900
I'm very embarrassed.

467
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,900
You're going to come out and...

468
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:27,900
I thought I was a deer and I was like...

469
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:28,900
You're waiting.

470
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:29,900
I'm waiting.

471
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:32,900
I'm waiting for this nervousness to run away.

472
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:34,900
I'm going to punch.

473
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:36,900
You're the same.

474
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:39,900
You've been hitting me for a while.

475
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:43,900
You think you're waiting for me to come back.

476
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:46,900
Excuse me.

477
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:48,900
6 years old?

478
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:52,900
What are you talking about?

479
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:58,900
If this was a normal 42 year old, you wouldn't be so old, right?

480
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:02,900
I'm a dead man to you

481
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:09,900
At that time, if I'm told that I'm not Matsumoto-san, I'd be like, oh no

482
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:12,900
Well, that's not a good example

483
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:19,800
I would like to introduce a popular model of me back in the day

484
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:21,300
One boy in trouble

485
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,960
He looks outht bench

486
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,980
He Go where the hell are you

487
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:26,160
Give him Ninden

488
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:27,380
Keine

489
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:29,060
He proclaims to leach

490
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,940
It was like Hei!

491
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:34,100
It was like Hei, downwards

492
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,020
One guy Cloud

493
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:37,580
The other Soul

494
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:40,980
One girl
