1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Next time on Gaki no Tsukai,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Tamage!

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Next time on Gaki no Tsukai,

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Chiki-chiki rugby match!

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Batsuzen Menomichi!

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Ah, the young men have gathered.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I said young men, but look at this.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
It's full of garbage.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Can you stand up for a moment?

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:32,000
You are Peanuts-kun.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Let's play rugby.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Let's do it.

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
The members are like this.

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
After deciding the punishment game.

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Ah, everyone is going to be trained?

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
It's not a selection, it's a draft.

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I understand.

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
First of all, you will become a popular person in the aquarium.

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Everyone, if you are watching the show, please gather around.

20
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
And you will do a show here.

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
That's a great person.

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
You have to do a show on this side of the glass bar.

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
That's the punishment.

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
What does it mean to spray water with a scrub?

25
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Why are you throwing away rugby scrubs?

26
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
What are you talking about?

27
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
You are a no-use series.

28
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Next, Garison-kun and Booby-chan are American kids.

29
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
What is this?

30
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Tsukasa-chan is aiming for Hayami.

31
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
He is aiming for it.

32
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
He is really a no-use series.

33
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
If you use it.

34
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Come on.

35
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
It's a no-use series.

36
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
It's a no-use series.

37
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
It's a no-use series.

38
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Next, punch-bar with Daibutsumaide Zenza.

39
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
This may be interesting.

40
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
This may be interesting.

41
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
It's a no-use series.

42
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
This may be interesting.

43
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
It's a no-use series.

44
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
If you use it.

45
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
This is a no-use series.

46
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
This is a no-use series.

47
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Explain it.

48
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Explain it.

49
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
In this no-use series.

50
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
In this no-use series.

51
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
In this no-use series.

52
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,000
In this no-use series.

53
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
In this no-use series.

54
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
You can fly.

55
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
You can fly.

56
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
In this no-use series.

57
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Well, I don't know.

58
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Let's go with the elimination method.

59
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I don't like this one.

60
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
It's not expensive.

61
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Let's leave this one, too.

62
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
The American Kid.

63
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I think we can leave this one.

64
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
For Suga-chan, too.

65
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I don't like it.

66
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
This one or this one.

67
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
We can't leave this one.

68
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
That's right.

69
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
We might lose because of these guys.

70
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
You and I might do our best.

71
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
We might lose because of these guys.

72
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
That's where it comes out.

73
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
This one.

74
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
This one.

75
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
This one.

76
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
This one.

77
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
This time, this punishment game is a double structure.

78
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I see.

79
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
This is the captain.

80
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
You're the captain.

81
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I'll tell you.

82
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
You can't have a perm with long hair.

83
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
What?

84
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
After you buy it?

85
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
After you buy it.

86
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
What are you talking about?

87
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I'll make it 2 cm long.

88
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
And then I'll curl it.

89
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
You can't have a perm with weak hair.

90
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,000
That's why it's funny.

91
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
You got it, right?

92
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
You guys are trying to make the show more exciting.

93
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Now we're going to divide into teams.

94
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
But we don't know what they're capable of.

95
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
So today, we have three teachers.

96
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
What do you do first?

97
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I tackle.

98
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
You tackle, right?

99
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Excuse me.

100
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
This camera guy is amazing.

101
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
He's my manager.

102
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
He's a camera guy.

103
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
He's a camera guy.

104
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
He's a camera guy.

105
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
He's a camera guy.

106
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
He's a camera guy.

107
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
You're holding him.

108
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I'm going to take it.

109
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
No.

110
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
You're going to do it?

111
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:45,500
Yes.

112
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,000
Yes.

113
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,500
You should have done it from the start.

114
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,000
I did it when I saw it.

115
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
It's totally different.

116
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,500
Kama-chan.

117
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,500
Now, let's go into the trout.

118
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,000
Yes.

119
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,500
Are you ready?

120
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,000
Yes.

121
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
By the way, who wants to be on my team?

122
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
What?

123
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Are you serious?

124
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Let's do rock-paper-scissors.

125
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Rock-paper-scissors.

126
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Yes.

127
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
You go first.

128
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Is it okay?

129
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Yes, I won.

130
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
If you do it from the start, it should be Okamoto.

131
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I see.

132
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Okamoto-kun.

133
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Okamoto-kun.

134
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I'll go first with my body.

135
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Yes, Noriyasu.

136
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I did it.

137
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I did it.

138
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Takasu.

139
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I got it.

140
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
You guys really don't want to be on my team.

141
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Producer Sugai.

142
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I got it.

143
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Takasu.

144
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I did it.

145
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I got it.

146
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
You.

147
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I got it.

148
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Hey.

149
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Why are you looking at me with sad eyes?

150
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Actually, I feel the same way as Akko.

151
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Seriously.

152
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I can't even speak.

153
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Let me sleep.

154
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Really?

155
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Yamazaki and I are two girls.

156
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
No, the four of you are a couple.

157
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
That's right.

158
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
That's right.

159
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
That's right.

160
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
That's right.

161
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
That's right.

162
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
That's right.

163
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
That's right.

164
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Shinohara-san.

165
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Yamazaki.

166
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Yamazaki wants to come here.

167
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Yamazaki has been...

168
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Hamada-san and I are different.

169
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
We are different.

170
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
We are different.

171
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
What should I do? It's difficult.

172
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
What should I do?

173
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I've been working out for 44 years.

174
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Shinohara-san.

175
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Why don't you wrap it up and go home?

176
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
You even have a tackle.

177
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Why don't you wrap it up and go home?

178
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Ame-chan is naive.

179
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I'm naive.

180
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Ladies and gentlemen.

181
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
She's here today.

182
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
She's calling me Tama-chan.

183
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
She's calling me Tama-chan.

184
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
She's so excited that she's calling me Tama-chan.

185
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
What's that?

186
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Hama-chan is Tama-chan.

187
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Hama-chan is in a class higher than Hama-chan.

188
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Hama-chan is higher than Hama-chan.

189
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
She's becoming Tama-chan.

190
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
She's becoming Tama-chan.

191
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
You're talking too much.

192
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
You're talking too much.

193
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
It's work.

194
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I don't like it.

195
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
You're like a showman every day.

196
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
You're coming out.

197
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
It's work.

198
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I don't like it because I don't have any makeup on.

199
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I don't like it because my face is so pale.

200
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Sometimes it hurts.

201
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I'll hit you.

202
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Even if you hit me, I can't change my opinion.

203
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
You're talking about your face in front of makeup.

204
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Is it broken?

205
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
That's it.

206
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I don't know.

207
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
What's the matter?

208
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
What's the matter?

209
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
You shouldn't do this kind of work for a long time.

210
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
You should wear makeup every day for 10 or 20 years.

211
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
What?

212
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
You'll become a makeup artist.

213
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
That's a big deal.

214
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I think so.

215
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Let's stop it.

216
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
What?

217
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Let's stop it.

218
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I don't care.

219
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Let's stop it.

220
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
It will continue tomorrow and the day after tomorrow.

221
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
That's right.

222
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I want to go out to play.

223
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
What?

224
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Just the two of us?

225
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Really?

226
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Really?

227
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I don't like it.

228
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Why do you go on a private trip?

229
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I don't like people who watch TV.

230
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I hate them.

231
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I don't like them.

232
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
What?

233
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Do you hate me?

234
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I don't like it.

235
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
It's disgusting.

236
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Don't say it's disgusting.

237
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
No, no.

238
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I don't like it.

239
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
If you walk around like this,

240
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
there's no one who looks like Sakura.

241
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
If you walk around like this,

242
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
there's no one who looks like Sakura.

243
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
It's disgusting.

244
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Is it weird?

245
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
It's weird.

246
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I feel like this.

247
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
You're the same.

248
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I understand.

249
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Why are you doing this?

250
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I'm not doing anything bad.

251
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Let's go somewhere.

252
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
What?

253
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Just the two of us.

254
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Why?

255
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Why can't we go together?

256
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
What if it's just the two of us?

257
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
That would be dangerous.

258
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
It's not like that.

259
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
It's not like that.

260
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
It's disgusting.

261
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Is it?

262
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Is it disgusting?

263
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Isn't it disgusting?

264
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
If you take a private room on the Shinkansen,

265
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
people won't know.

266
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I don't want to.

267
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Why don't you go to a private room?

268
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Why?

269
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
What are you talking about?

270
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Don't say that.

271
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
We've been friends since elementary school.

272
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
What are you talking about?

273
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I want to talk to you.

274
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Right?

275
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I don't want to talk to you anymore.

276
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I want to talk to you here.

277
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Why are you laughing?

278
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
How are you doing?

279
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Are you eating?

280
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Shut up!

281
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
We can talk about that.

282
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
It's fine.

283
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
It's fine.

284
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
But, you know,

285
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I'm going to work.

286
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I'm going to the same school.

287
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Same school.

288
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
We're not going to be there.

289
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
We're not going to be there.

290
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
We're going to the same school.

291
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I'm going to be there.

292
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I'm always going to pick you up.

293
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I'm always going to be in this state.

294
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
You're not going to be there.

295
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I'm not going to be there.

296
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I don't know how to explain it to everyone.

297
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Why can't we be together?

298
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
We're a team.

299
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I think everyone is wondering what's going on.

300
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
But we're really close.

301
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
That's right.

302
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
We're really close.

303
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I can't stand it if we're in the same room.

304
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I can't stand it.

305
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
So we're together.

306
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
If someone is doing a show,

307
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
there's D,

308
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
D,

309
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
and the manager.

310
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I don't bite at that time.

311
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I talk a lot at that time.

312
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Mr. Okamoto, you have a call.

313
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Mr. Okamoto.

314
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I don't know what to do when I'm alone.

315
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Suddenly,

316
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I'm alone on the other side of the road.

317
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I don't know what to do.

318
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I don't know what to do.

319
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
That's right.

320
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
It's disgusting.

321
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
That's right.

322
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
It's like that in the dressing room.

323
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Why can't we be together?

324
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I hope we can be together.

325
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I'd like to go there once.

326
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I have to work.

327
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I'll make some time.

328
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Okinawa is very crowded now.

329
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Why?

330
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I don't know.

331
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
It's all on the net.

332
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
In Okinawa.

333
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Okinawa is popular.

334
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
It doesn't matter.

335
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Okinawa people are black.

336
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
They have thick eyebrows.

337
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
That's right.

338
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I went to Okinawa.

339
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I want to do it.

340
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I can't do it in Okinawa.

341
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
All the young people who have gathered in Okinawa

342
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
do it.

343
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Last time,

344
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
you didn't write a letter to the governor of Okinawa.

345
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I don't know the people in Okinawa.

346
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I don't know.

347
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I don't know.

348
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I only know people from Osaka or Tokyo.

349
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
What?

350
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Do you know a Thai person?

351
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Wait a minute.

352
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Wait a minute.

353
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
You too!

354
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I don't know.

355
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
You...

356
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
You...

357
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Do something.

358
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
What are you talking about?

359
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
You're a Thai person.

360
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
While you're doing it,

361
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
why don't you sing a folk song?

362
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Hamada Masatoshi.

363
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Matsumoto Hitoshi's idol-like plan.

364
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
You're talking nonsense.

365
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Let's not talk about making up stories.

366
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
What are you talking about?

367
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
You...

368
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I'm not talking about making up stories.

369
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I'm not talking about your stupid stories.

370
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
That's right.

371
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I'm talking about the real story.

372
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
That's the real story.

373
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I'm going to the lawyer's office.

374
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
What?

375
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I don't want to see it anymore.

376
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
What are you talking about?

377
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I'm going to the lawyer's office.

378
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
What?

379
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I don't want to see it anymore.

380
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
You...

381
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
You're making up stories.

382
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Wake up!

383
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
What are you talking about?

384
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Do you do things like this?

385
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I did.

386
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I don't know.

387
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
We went together.

388
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
We went together.

389
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
We went together.

390
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
We went to a place like Hinadan.

391
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
You chose it earlier.

392
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I chose it.

393
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
What?

394
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I chose number 29.

395
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
That's because I wanted a badge for number 29.

396
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
You're funny.

397
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I was just asked to tell me what to do.

398
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
What did you do?

399
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
What?

400
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
You're a strange person.

401
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I don't understand.

402
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
What kind of story is this?

403
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Are you suspecting me?

404
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
You don't have to say it.

405
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
You only know women in Tokyo and Osaka.

406
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
You only know women in Tai.

407
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
You only know women in Tokyo and Osaka.

408
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
What do you know?

409
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
What?

410
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
What kind of woman do you know?

411
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I don't know either.

412
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
You don't like foreign women?

413
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I can't speak English.

414
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Do you like American women?

415
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I don't like them.

416
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
You don't like them?

417
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
No.

418
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Do you like French women?

419
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I don't like them at all.

420
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Do you like British women?

421
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I don't like them.

422
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Do you like Thai women?

423
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I don't like them at all.

424
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I have a question.

425
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:04,000
When you get on and off the train,

426
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,000
do you always have the same attache case?

427
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Why is that?

428
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
What is it?

429
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Do you know?

430
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,000
It's not like that.

431
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
It's not like that.

432
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
It's necessary.

433
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
It's necessary for all drivers.

434
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
You don't need this case, do you?

435
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
It's inside.

436
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
What's inside?

437
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Something like this.

438
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Something like this?

439
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
That's for yourself.

440
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
What?

441
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
That's for yourself?

442
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Something like this?

443
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Yes.

444
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Something like this.

445
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
You don't have that.

446
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Really?

447
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Really?

448
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I don't think that attache case is necessary.

449
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Everyone has it.

450
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Even pilots.

451
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
A pilot's attache case has no meaning.

452
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
It's just an attachment.

453
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
It's just an attachment.

454
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Why do you look so angry?

455
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I don't think it's an attache case.

456
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
It's an attache case?

457
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
How did you see it?

458
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
It was just a black board.

459
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
With a handle.

460
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I don't know if you see it, but it's a board.

461
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
It's a condom.

462
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,000
You're the one who made it with a handle.

463
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
You did it with a handle.

464
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
You're taking so much time.

465
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
It doesn't have to be, either.

466
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I drove it and opened it.

467
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
What? I'm going to drive it now.

468
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Do you want me to explain?

469
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Is it that scary?

470
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I'm not saying anything.

471
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
It's not. It's not.

472
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,400
That's a

473
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,000
It's not. It's not.

474
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
It's not in there.

475
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
The one that's in the book.

476
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
That's the ticket.

477
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Where did you get it?

478
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Green.

479
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
And 5000 yen plus.

480
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
There's something like that.

481
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I'm putting all that in there.

482
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Is it like that?

483
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Of course.

484
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
It's definitely not.

485
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
That's right.

486
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I think it's cool.

487
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
A pilot.

488
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
A pilot wants to be popular with women.

489
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
I think it's like that.

490
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
There's no such thing as a young man.

491
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Well, if you're young, you want to do it.

492
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
There's something like that.

493
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
But it's a movie.

494
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
My pen name is Machiko.

495
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,000
There are people who blow their breath on their hands when they work hard.

496
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Why is that?

497
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
And when you have something heavy,

498
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
There are people who put their fangs on their hands.

499
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Why is that?

500
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
It's as easy to understand as it is when you're excited.

501
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
It's as easy to understand as it is when you're excited.

502
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I didn't understand it at all.

503
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Are you still saying that?

504
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Are you still saying that you're excited?

505
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I don't want to talk about that anymore.

506
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I don't want to talk about that anymore.

507
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I'll tell you this.

508
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
When you blow your fangs on your hands, you do this.

509
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
This is because you're giving them moisture.

510
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
What do you call it?

511
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Do you call it being excited?

512
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
What?

513
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I'm giving them moisture here.

514
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
You're giving them moisture here.

515
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Yes, that's right.

516
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
This is because you're excited.

517
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Like this.

518
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Hey!

519
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
And when you do that, the moisture goes down here.

520
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
You can make a veil of moisture like this.

521
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
A water cannon.

522
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Where?

523
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
When you blow your fangs like this.

524
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
That's not true.

525
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Where's the moisture?

526
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
You're not fooling me.

527
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Everyone can do it.

528
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
You blow your fangs here, right?

529
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:42,000
The more you think about it, the better it feels.

530
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
That's what you're trying to say.

531
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
That's right.

532
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
It feels good now.

533
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
I just blew my fangs.

534
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
It doesn't feel good if you don't blow your fangs.

535
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Try touching this.

536
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Really? That's not true.

537
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
That's not true, right?

538
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
You blow your fangs here, right?

539
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
It feels warm.

540
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
That's not true.

541
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
You blow your fangs here, right?

542
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Hey!

543
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,000
It hurts more if you blow your fangs here.

544
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
So you're saying this one doesn't hurt?

545
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Everything that has love has the nature of blowing your fangs.

546
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Only humans have that.

547
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
You're saying something I don't understand.

548
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:32,000
This is my precious jar.

549
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,000
You blow your fangs to something that's important to you.

550
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Is that so?

551
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Yes.

552
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:43,000
You blow your fangs to the feelings you have for the other person.

553
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
I'm going to kill this guy!

554
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
If you get any closer than that,

555
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
stop blowing your fangs!

556
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:52,000
No, no, no.

557
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Are you trying to hit the criminal?

558
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
No!

559
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
I'm going to kill him, so stop blowing your fangs!

560
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
This one?

561
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Yes.

562
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I'm not going to kill him, so stop blowing your fangs.

563
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
You're saying this?

564
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
I'm saying this.

565
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
This is complicated.

566
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Why?

567
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Are you going to blow your fangs?

568
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
I'm going to.

569
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
It's like a sports club.

570
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
It's not just a sports club.

571
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Everyone is like that.

572
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
I can't say it.

573
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
What can't you say?

574
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
What can't you say?

575
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
What can't you say?

576
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
No matter what I put on, I can't say it.

577
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Say it.

578
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:46,000
I'm going to kill you.

579
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:51,000
I'm going to kill you.

580
00:21:51,000 --> 00:22:06,000
I'm going to kill you.
