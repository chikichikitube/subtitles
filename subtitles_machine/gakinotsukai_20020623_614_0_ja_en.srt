1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
It's been a long time since I've seen you.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Me too, George.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Yama-chan, I want to see George too.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
In the back.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Yes.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Only George.

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Let's see George.

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
No, there's only one.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
There's only Miho.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
This is the old book.

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I like George.

12
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
It's cool.

13
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I don't want to see George.

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
What are you going to do next?

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Let's do it again.

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Let's do it without water next time.

17
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
We can do it for about 5 minutes.

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
We can do it.

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
We can do it for more than 5 minutes.

20
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I don't know if that picture will last.

21
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
If it doesn't last.

22
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Of course we'll add water to the opponent.

23
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
We can't win.

24
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
We can't win.

25
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Excuse me.

26
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Something terrible has happened.

27
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Iie-chan.

28
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
What are you going to do, Iie-chan?

29
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
It's not the time to be excited.

30
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Mr. Suga fell down.

31
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Is that Irie's job?

32
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
It's unusual.

33
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Can you come here for a moment?

34
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
What?

35
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Mr. Suga fell down.

36
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Why?

37
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Please come here.

38
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
You're talking nonsense.

39
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
You're talking nonsense.

40
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Irie was taken to the scene without knowing the reason.

41
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
What are you doing?

42
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I don't know.

43
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
What happened?

44
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
What happened?

45
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Irie-chan, what happened?

46
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I was working.

47
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I don't know why, but he asked me to help him.

48
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
When I hit him, I hit him in the head.

49
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Did you hit him?

50
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Yes.

51
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
That's not good.

52
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
It's an accident.

53
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
It's Irie-chan's fault.

54
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Hey, what are you going to do?

55
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Excuse me.

56
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Old man.

57
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Mr. Suga.

58
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Hey.

59
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Get up.

60
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Get up.

61
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Get up.

62
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I was surprised.

63
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I didn't know you were coming.

64
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I was surprised.

65
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I didn't know you were coming.

66
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I was surprised.

67
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I'm glad.

68
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
What happened?

69
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
What's wrong?

70
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Where are you going?

71
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
He is very enthusiastic.

72
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I'll do it, too.

73
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Who?

74
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
No.

75
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Isn't it Mr. Matsumoto?

76
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
It's already on air.

77
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Isn't it Mr. Matsumoto?

78
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
It's already on air.

79
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
What is this camera?

80
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Shooting?

81
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Do you know the camera?

82
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Mr. Suga often uses it.

83
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
It's a child's camera.

84
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
It's a child's camera.

85
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
It's a child's camera.

86
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
It's not for recording.

87
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
No.

88
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
What?

89
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
What is this?

90
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Is it a camera?

91
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I don't know.

92
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
It's amazing.

93
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
It's not a camera.

94
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
It's not a camera.

95
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
It's not a camera.

96
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Who is it?

97
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
What is your favorite TV show?

98
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Metropolitan TV.

99
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Where is it?

100
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
What is it?

101
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I've heard of it.

102
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
It's not here.

103
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Bring the music.

104
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Bring the music.

105
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Yes.

106
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Please.

107
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Please.

108
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
What's wrong?

109
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I don't know.

110
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I don't know.

111
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I don't know.

112
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I don't know.

113
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
This program is sponsored by the following sponsors.

114
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
You don't remember?

115
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I don't know.

116
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Is it a program that doesn't use musical instruments?

117
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
No.

118
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
You don't know?

119
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Does your head hurt?

120
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
A little.

121
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
A little?

122
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
This is a serious problem.

123
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Hey, Heipo!

124
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Really?

125
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
This is Heipo.

126
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
What should I do?

127
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
What should I do?

128
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
You've been dating for a long time.

129
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
We've been dating for 20 years.

130
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Yes.

131
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Don't you know?

132
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Heipo.

133
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Heipo.

134
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Heipo.

135
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
What is that?

136
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
The way he laughs now.

137
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
The way he laughs now.

138
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
It's a characteristic.

139
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Something.

140
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
It's a characteristic.

141
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
What should I do?

142
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
The door of memory.

143
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Did you open it?

144
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
What is that?

145
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Something.

146
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
The way he laughs.

147
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Let's play the tatami in Heipo.

148
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
That's right.

149
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Let's show a lot of the best scenes of Heipo.

150
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
That's right.

151
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Then you might remember.

152
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
You remember, right?

153
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
How is it?

154
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
It's coming.

155
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
It's coming.

156
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Hang in there.

157
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
One more push.

158
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
One more push.

159
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
A little more.

160
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
A little more.

161
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I want to do one more push.

162
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
One more push.

163
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
A little more.

164
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Oh, there it is.

165
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
There are so many.

166
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
There are so many.

167
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
This is Heipo.

168
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
That's right.

169
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
It's Heipo.

170
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Absolutely.

171
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I'll definitely do it today.

172
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
This person is also a box artist.

173
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
That's right.

174
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
What are you doing?

175
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I'll do it properly.

176
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
That's enough.

177
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
This, this, this, this.

178
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
That's enough.

179
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
That's enough.

180
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
That's right.

181
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
You remember a lot.

182
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Hey, hey.

183
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Stop it.

184
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I won't do it anymore.

185
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Stop it.

186
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Stop it.

187
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
This, this, this.

188
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Why are you feeling it?

189
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I'll do it.

190
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
You remember.

191
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Stop it.

192
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
How is it?

193
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
How is it?

194
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I feel like you remember something.

195
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
What are you going to do?

196
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Heipo, really.

197
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Stop it.

198
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I don't want to do it anymore.

199
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I don't want to do it anymore.

200
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Heipo-san.

201
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Heipo-san.

202
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Heipo-san.

203
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Heipo-san.

204
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Heipo-san.

205
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Heipo-san.

206
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Heipo-san.

207
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
This, this, this.

208
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
How is it?

209
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Heipo, what are you guys doing?

210
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
It's fun.

211
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
It's fun.

212
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
What should we do?

213
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
What else was there?

214
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Heipo...

215
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Sorry.

216
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Can you change your clothes?

217
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Heipo, change your clothes.

218
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Change your clothes.

219
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I think it's better to actually do it.

220
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Definitely.

221
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I understand.

222
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I'll change my clothes.

223
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Thank you.

224
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I'll change my clothes.

225
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Thank you.

226
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
You guys, stop it.

227
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
It's fun.

228
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
It's fun.

229
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Even if it's just for show.

230
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Even if it's just for show.

231
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Then, with this...

232
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Yes.

233
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Let's see it in front of us.

234
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
It's a name.

235
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Yes.

236
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Thank you for waiting.

237
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Thank you for waiting.

238
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
This is hard.

239
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
What is this?

240
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
What is this?

241
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Give me the gun.

242
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
The gun.

243
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I'm scared.

244
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
He said he's scared.

245
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
He's already been shot.

246
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
He's scared.

247
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
He's already been shot.

248
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
What is this?

249
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
What is this?

250
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
What is this?

251
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
It's different.

252
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
What is this?

253
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
What is this?

254
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
He's still alive.

255
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
He's still alive.

256
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Do you really think so?

257
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
In this situation.

258
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
It's a small one.

259
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
It's a small one.

260
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I don't want to die.

261
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
He's still alive.

262
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
He's still alive.

263
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
What's going to happen?

264
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
He's dead.

265
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Okay.

266
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
What's going to happen?

267
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Okay.

268
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Okay.

269
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I don't know what's going to happen.

270
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I don't know what's going to happen.

271
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
He was thinner than before.

272
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
He was thinner than before.

273
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
He was thinner than before.

274
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
That's right.

275
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
He was like a rice.

276
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
He was like a rice.

277
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I can't remember.

278
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I can't remember.

279
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Just a little more.

280
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Really.

281
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Is he here?

282
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Yes.

283
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
He's here.

284
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
He's here.

285
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Let's put the tatami on him.

286
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
This should do it.

287
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Are you okay?

288
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Yes, I'm okay.

289
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Okay.

290
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Okay.

291
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
He's here.

292
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
He's here.

293
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
He's here.

294
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I'm not good at this.

295
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
He's here.

296
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Bo-chan.

297
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
It's moving.

298
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Bo-chan.

299
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
It's moving.

300
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Bo-chan.

301
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Bo-chan.

302
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Bo-chan.

303
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Wait.

304
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Bo-chan.

305
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Bo-chan.

306
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Bo-chan.

307
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Bo-chan.

308
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Aoya.

309
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Aoya.

310
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
What are you two?

311
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,660
It's done!

312
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:37,020
I'm starving!

313
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:42,360
Ho-rum! Ho-rum! Ho-rum! Ho-rum!

314
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:53,360
Ho-rum! Ho-rum! Ho-rum! Ho-rum! Ho-rum! Ho-rum! Cage!

315
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:58,140
Ho-rum! Ho-rum! Ho-rum! Ho-rum! ho-rum!

316
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:00,140
No ~~~

317
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:02,140
Amazing!

318
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:08,140
That was the pilot episode.

319
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:10,140
To put it simply.

320
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:12,140
Sorry.

321
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:15,140
We did the pilot episode.

322
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:30,140
That was the pilot episode.
