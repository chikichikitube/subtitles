1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
At last, tonight, the judges of Ojo and Matsumoto are here.

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
This program is brought to you by the following sponsors.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I was taking my acquaintance to an izakaya because the food there was delicious.

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I introduced him to a good izakaya, and we went there.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
We went there, drank, ate, and made a fuss.

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
After a long time, when it was time to pay, Matsumoto came over and said,

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Thank you for the meal.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
But after that, he said to me,

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I don't say this because I'm your acquaintance, but it's about 20,000 yen.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
It's 20,000 yen. It's very cheap, isn't it?

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
But I don't say this because I'm your acquaintance, but it's a lot of money.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Really?

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
It's expensive.

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
It's cheap.

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
It's delicious.

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
It's delicious.

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
It's delicious.

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
It's delicious.

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
It's delicious.

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I'm pretending to be old.

21
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
That's not true.

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
That's not true.

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
It's not what you guys say.

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'm not going to let you eat.

25
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
You have to act cool.

26
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
We are leaders.

27
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
You have nothing to do with us!

28
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
We are all Yoshimoto! You are Jinrikisha!

29
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
No, I'm not! I'm Yoshimoto!

30
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
You are Jinrikisha!

31
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
No, I'm Yoshimoto!

32
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
You are Yoshimoto!

33
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I'm Yoshimoto!

34
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
You don't know?

35
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
What are you talking about?

36
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:54,000
When I go shopping, I buy things like Uniqlo and Jeans Maid. I spend about 3,000 yen on pants.

37
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I don't know if I should buy it or not. I don't know if I should put it on the price list.

38
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I can't buy it.

39
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I don't have any designer clothes, so I asked my senior if I could buy it.

40
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I looked at the price list and it was 8,000 yen.

41
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I can't buy it.

42
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I was surprised.

43
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I can't buy it.

44
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I can't buy it.

45
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I can't buy it.

46
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I can!

47
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I can't buy it!

48
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I can!

49
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I can't buy it!

50
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I can!

51
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I can!

52
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
What are you talking about?

53
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
You have a big nose and a small nose.

54
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
It's not important.

55
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
You can choose between two noses.

56
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
What do you mean?

57
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
You can choose between two noses.

58
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
What are you talking about?

59
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Next is Endo.

60
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
It's not from me, but I have a witness.

61
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
May I come in?

62
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Please come in.

63
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Please come in.

64
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
This is Fujiwara, the manager of Matsumoto.

65
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
This is Kimotsu, the manager of Hamada.

66
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
How many years have you been working for Fujiwara?

67
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
It's been three and a half years.

68
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
It's been three and a half years, right?

69
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
He has been working with most of the managers.

70
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
It's been three and a half years.

71
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Have you ever been offered anything in the three and a half years?

72
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Well...

73
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Don't lie to me!

74
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
He's lying!

75
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I offered him coffee at the airport in Los Angeles.

76
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
What are you talking about?

77
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
What's wrong with you?

78
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I don't think he has ever said that.

79
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
How long have you been working for Kimotsu?

80
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
It's been three and a half years.

81
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Have you ever been offered anything in the three and a half years?

82
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I've never been offered anything in the three and a half years.

83
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,000
He's lying!

84
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,000
He's lying!

85
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:02,000
He's lying!

86
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
What's in your pocket?

87
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I've been offered something.

88
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I've been offered something.

89
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Have you ever been offered coffee?

90
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I've never been offered coffee.

91
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
He's lying!

92
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
What do you mean?

93
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I'll explain it later.

94
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I'll explain it later.

95
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
When was your birthday?

96
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
It was my birthday last month.

97
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Congratulations.

98
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I happened to meet two people in the dressing room.

99
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I took out 50,000 yen from my pocket.

100
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
That's cool.

101
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
That's cool.

102
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Wait, wait, wait.

103
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
You don't have to clap.

104
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Wait, wait, wait.

105
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Wait, wait, wait.

106
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Is this a segment where you take out 50,000 yen?

107
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
No, it's not like that.

108
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
As the same manager, I took out 50,000 yen on my birthday.

109
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
It's better to buy something you like than to die.

110
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
It's cool, isn't it?

111
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
It's cool.

112
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
It's cool.

113
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Fujiwara.

114
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Say that.

115
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
There's something like that, isn't there?

116
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
There is.

117
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
For Matsumoto.

118
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
It wasn't my birthday.

119
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
On Matsumoto's birthday,

120
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:43,000
the staff prepared a huge cake and a lot of food.

121
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
They prepared a lot of food.

122
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I ate the cake with everyone.

123
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I gave the bouquet to Matsumoto on the way home.

124
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
He said, give it to your wife.

125
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I gave it to him and went home.

126
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,000
That's a lot of money.

127
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Fujiwara, that's not it.

128
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
It's from the other day.

129
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Is there?

130
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Say that.

131
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Please say there is.

132
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Say that.

133
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Say that, or make that.

134
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Make that.

135
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I don't have that kind of power.

136
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:37,000
However, Fujiwara gave a birthday present to Matsumoto as a gift.

137
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Really?

138
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Did you give it to him?

139
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Yes.

140
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I gave him a birthday pin.

141
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Even though he gave him a pin,

142
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Matsumoto didn't give anything to Fujiwara.

143
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I think that's a problem.

144
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:01,000
To be honest, I don't need a neck tie pin.

145
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I'm scared.

146
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Take it off!

147
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Take it off!

148
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
It won't come out.

149
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Don't touch it.

150
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Don't touch it.

151
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I don't feel good touching it.

152
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Sit down.

153
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
What?

154
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:31,000
What?

155
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
He's flustered.

156
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,000
He's flustered.

157
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:46,000
He's flustered.

158
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
That was a few years ago.

159
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:55,000
When Matsumoto went to Ise with Kimura, Imada and Itao.

160
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
When we arrive at Ise, let's eat delicious food.

161
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Ise?

162
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Ise shrimp is really delicious.

163
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:08,000
The car is full of excitement and we finally arrive at Ise.

164
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Yay!

165
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Parque Espana!

166
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
First, the four of us enjoy the sightseeing.

167
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
And then Matsumoto...

168
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I remember there was Nichi earlier.

169
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Can I stop by before we eat?

170
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Sure.

171
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Sure.

172
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
For Matsumoto, who likes cheap restaurants,

173
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Nichi is an interesting existence.

174
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
He couldn't help but stop by.

175
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,000
What is this T-shirt?

176
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
It's really cheap.

177
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I should buy it.

178
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Matsumoto is excited like a fish in the water.

179
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
And when the shopping is over...

180
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I'm hungry.

181
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Let's eat something.

182
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Let's go!

183
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Let's go!

184
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Let's go!

185
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
We can finally eat Ise shrimp.

186
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
You're such a nosy kid.

187
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
But...

188
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I'm sure there's a restaurant in the basement.

189
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Matsumoto!

190
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
The three of them were thinking the opposite.

191
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Matsumoto went to the udon restaurant in the basement.

192
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
And when the food he ordered came out...

193
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
This isn't enough.

194
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I'm sure there's a croquette there.

195
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I'm sorry, but can you bring it here?

196
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
But if I bring it in, I'll get in trouble.

197
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Why don't you ask the owner?

198
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I'm the one in the car.

199
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Excuse me, can I bring it in?

200
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Normally, you're not allowed to bring it in.

201
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:51,000
But the owner accepted Matsumoto's request.

202
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:58,000
And when he added the croquette that Kimura bought to the side dish...

203
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
This is Taragosu.

204
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
The volume is different.

205
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Matsumoto was very happy with the udon.

206
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:15,000
In the end, he came to Ise to eat udon.

207
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I see.

208
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
The witness, please come forward.

209
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
The witness, please come forward.

210
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
What the hell is that?

211
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
That's harsh.

212
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
That's harsh.

213
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Is this true?

214
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:49,000
If I didn't have a chance like this, I would have brought this story to the coffin.

215
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I see.

216
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I would have brought this story to the coffin.

217
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
What I'm curious about is...

218
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:00,000
In the video, you said that you were supposed to eat fish.

219
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
What kind of meal is that?

220
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
It's dinner.

221
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
It's not lunch?

222
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
It's not lunch.

223
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:13,000
If it was lunch, I would have had udon.

224
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Is that dinner?

225
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
It's dinner.

226
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I can't even think about it.

227
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Of course, when I was looking at the T-shirt and pants on Sunday...

228
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I thought I would turn the car around.

229
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I see.

230
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
So that you can go to Meji-kun as soon as you're done shopping.

231
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I thought so.

232
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I wanted to go to a restaurant in the basement.

233
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I see.

234
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
There was a Tatchan croquette.

235
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I was very interested in it.

236
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I see.

237
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Why?

238
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I've never eaten it before.

239
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I don't know if it's different from the one I ate in Ise.

240
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I was wondering if Umehimeya-san was running away.

241
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I was wondering why he was running away.

242
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I see.

243
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I understand that question.

244
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I thought it would be bad if I ate it all.

245
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I was hungry.

246
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
So I went to Ise and Awabi about an hour later.

247
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
That's a good idea.

248
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
That's what I planned.

249
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
That's another way of thinking.

250
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
That's right.

251
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I want to say that it's better to have that way of thinking.

252
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
That's bad.

253
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
That's a bad way of thinking.

254
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Why are you looking at me?

255
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Don't open your eyes.

256
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Is it okay for you to eat udon?

257
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I usually eat a lot of healthy food.

258
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Is that so?

259
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
No.

260
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
No?

261
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
It's healthy food.

262
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I don't know if there was a lot of excitement in Parque Espana.

263
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
What kind of excitement?

264
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,000
It was like a river.

265
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
There were four people on a boat.

266
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
It was like a drift.

267
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Eventually, the river broke.

268
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
The boat sank a little.

269
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
The boat sank about three meters.

270
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I see.

271
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I thought, is that so?

272
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:32,000
What is that?

273
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
You're an interesting person.

274
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:40,000
You're a person who can think of more interesting things.

275
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:45,000
That's what I thought.

276
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
What is that?

277
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I want to apologize to Yamazaki and Pocorico after the rain.

278
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I want to apologize.

279
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
It's been a while since I've been here.

280
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
It's been a while.

281
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I couldn't stop being a man.

282
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
It's okay.

283
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
It's okay.

284
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
It's wonderful.

285
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:19,000
You know what? You guys are not funny.

286
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I'm playing with you guys but you're not funny.

287
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Go away.

288
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
When I went on a trip, what did you do when I asked you to stay with me?

289
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
You're a good-for-nothing.

290
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Go away.

291
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
You guys are not funny. Go away.

292
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I still have a lot to say but I can't say it in words so I wrote a letter.

293
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Please read it.

294
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,000
When I went to Russia for the first time as a souvenir, thank you for the 40-yen pin.

295
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
In Russia, the prices are cheap.

296
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
In Russia, the price is about 40,000 yen.

297
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
In Russia, the prices are about 40,000 yen.

298
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
You guys are not funny.

299
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Go away.

300
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I can't say it in words so I wrote a letter.

301
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Please read it.

302
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Do you know him?

303
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Kimura Yuichi.

304
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Do you know him?

305
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I always carry 9 yen in my wallet for my brother who hates money.

306
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Do you know him?

307
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I pay for the video you borrowed.

308
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Do you know him?

309
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I didn't have enough money for Kimura Yuichi last year.

310
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Do you know him?

311
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I went to a karaoke shop with 10 people.

312
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I only had enough money for 3 people.

313
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Do you know him?

314
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I don't have a lot of money.

315
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Do you know him?

316
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Thank you.

317
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I feel bad.

318
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I feel bad.

319
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:34,000
After this, there will be an even more unbelievable event.

320
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
And the trial will be held in Kakyong.

321
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Don't film me.

322
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Can we watch the next video?

323
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Let's watch the special testimony video.

324
00:17:49,000 --> 00:18:01,000
The testimony I know is about Itao's wedding.

325
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I want to celebrate his wedding.

326
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I decided to give 100,000 yen for the wedding.

327
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:19,000
On the day of the wedding, I put 100,000 yen in a lucky bag.

328
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I noticed that Matsumoto was paying 70,000 yen.

329
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I was sad.

330
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I wanted to celebrate his wedding, but I changed it to 50,000 yen.

331
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,000
200,000 yen or 300,000 yen is normal.

332
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Please give us a little more money.

333
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:09,000
There was a team fight, so I asked him to give me a jersey I was wearing.

334
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
It was a jersey.

335
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
He probably earned it.

336
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:22,000
But why did you take one jersey home?

337
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I felt sorry for you.

338
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Please give me something.

339
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:38,000
It's been 15 years since I was loved.

340
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:48,000
The first thing I got was a Kitsune Udon for 170 yen.

341
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
It's been 15 years since I was loved.

342
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

343
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:10,000
It's been 15 years since I was loved.

344
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:17,000
When I go out to various places, I use a car.

345
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:27,000
I don't know why, but Matsumoto's habit is to go in one car.

346
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:40,000
It's more fun to go in one car with everyone.

347
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
I was convinced.

348
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:50,000
When I go out, I use one car.

349
00:20:50,000 --> 00:21:15,000
One day, I suddenly realized that I was going somewhere far away.

350
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

351
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

352
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
The VTR show is over.

353
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
What did you think of the show?

354
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Honestly, I was surprised by the last gasoline.

355
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I've been wondering for a while.

356
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
What is Onuma?

357
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
It doesn't matter.

358
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:58,000
The suit is the most autumn-like.

359
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
I'm looking at you.

360
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
He's the one who set up the trial.

361
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Judge, please give me the verdict.

362
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I'll give you the verdict.

363
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
I'll give you the verdict.

364
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,000
The defendant, Mr. Matsumoto, is a rich man.

365
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:28,000
It's hard to change the fact that he's been causing trouble to many people.

366
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:34,000
It's far beyond our expectations.

367
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
I can't help it.

368
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:43,000
So the verdict is a guilty verdict.

369
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:51,000
He will be fined 1 million yen from Matsumoto's savings.

370
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
It's strange.

371
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
It's strange, isn't it?

372
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Why?

373
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Is this a Japanese TV show?

374
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
You're going to have a stupid trial, too.

375
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Hey!

376
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Hey!

377
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Next week.

378
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Matsumoto will be fined 1 million yen from Matsumoto's savings.
