1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Let's do it!

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I've never done badminton before.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
That's right.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'll do it too.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
There's a net.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Really?

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Someone go there.

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I'll judge.

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
What?

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
What?

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Let's do rock-paper-scissors.

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
What's going on?

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
What's going on?

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
What do you think?

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The funny mess that appeared in the recording of the movie,

16
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
The first time, he died in a play,

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
And the second time, he died in a doll play.

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
The red chicken that ran to him later, was eaten by a ferret.

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
This time, what is their purpose?

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
We are doing a hero show right now.

21
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Please watch it.

22
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
It's starting soon.

23
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
No, no, no.

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Anyway, this is a show.

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Yes.

26
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
It's a revolutionary show.

27
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
But before that, if you could watch it a little bit.

28
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
It's a follow-up.

29
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I watched it before, but it was a little different.

30
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
There's a difference in time.

31
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
The previous Kami-shibai and Ninkyougeki was a bit unpopular, so I stopped it.

32
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
It's over soon.

33
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
It's over soon?

34
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
It's over soon?

35
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Yes, I can't take that long.

36
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Hero show?

37
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Yes, it is.

38
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
We have already done all the half-finished parts.

39
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Hi everyone! Thank you for waiting.

40
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Today, we have invited you to the Hero Show Super Victory.

41
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Now, let the hero show begin!

42
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Please say something.

43
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I said something, but I didn't understand.

44
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I see.

45
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
My name is Black Zorg.

46
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Our goal is to take over the world.

47
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I will destroy the Super Victory that always gets in the way for me.

48
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
What's with you guys?

49
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Since I came out, you don't look happy at all.

50
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Those of you who love Black Zorg, raise your hands.

51
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
You guys! You should have been ashamed of yourselves!

52
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
You bastards! You bastards!

53
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
You bastards! You bastards!

54
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:08,000
You bastards! You bastards!

55
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Come here!

56
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Everyone! This is terrible!

57
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
We have to shout out loud, Super Victory!

58
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Ready, set...

59
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Shagoo!

60
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
No, no! Call your big friends too!

61
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Ready, set...

62
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Shagoo!

63
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Wait!

64
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Who's there?

65
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
It's my friend!

66
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
It's not heavy at all.

67
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
It's different.

68
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
You've been caught by the super-duper-human.

69
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I'll be your opponent!

70
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
This is different!

71
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
It's a real fight!

72
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
It's a real fight!

73
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
It's amazing.

74
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
You're fast.

75
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
You're spinning around.

76
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
What the hell?

77
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Ah, I took off your scarf.

78
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Hurry up!

79
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
If you keep doing that, it's over.

80
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
You're so weird.

81
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
You can't even see me!

82
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
If you're like this, I'll turn into a monster!

83
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Mic, mic.

84
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Ah, mic, mic.

85
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Super Victory, I forgot the mic.

86
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
What the hell is this?

87
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
What the hell is this?

88
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I want to play badminton.

89
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
You're good.

90
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
What is this?

91
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
What?

92
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
What the hell is this?

93
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
He's like a tree.

94
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I don't understand what he's saying.

95
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I can't understand him.

96
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I don't understand.

97
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I don't remember well.

98
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I don't remember well either.

99
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Joking, kidding, kidding.

100
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Joking, kidding.

101
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Hey!

102
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I'm sorry.

103
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I'm sorry.

104
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
What are you doing?

105
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I'm just moving my body.

106
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I'm just moving my body.

107
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I'm just moving my body.

108
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I don't understand what you're saying.

109
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
You're a fool.

110
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
The meaning is...

111
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Long!

112
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
It's long.

113
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
It's a long song.

114
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Oh, he's gone.

115
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
It would be nice if he could always be bald.

116
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
It's not like he's gone missing.

117
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
It's like he's transformed in an instant.

118
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Oh!

119
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Lord Wada!

120
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
How long does it take to change that?

121
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
The power of surprise that can't be put into words, the right hand!

122
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
The infinite power that is in your body, the left hand!

123
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
He's looking at the pen with his bare hands.

124
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
The unbelievable power of mystery, the right leg!

125
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
You're slow!

126
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
The power of the king of the Great East Asia, the left leg!

127
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
This is a different style.

128
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Power Head, the power that destroys anything!

129
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Unforgettable power, Light Year!

130
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Power Head, the power that destroys anything!

131
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Unforgettable power, Light Leg!

132
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
The first law of the universe, the infinite power, Left Leg!

133
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,000
The proof of justice, Super Victory!

134
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
You're wearing a big hat.

135
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
You bastard!

136
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
What's with you?

137
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
You're not allowed to wear a hat.

138
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I will never forgive evil, Super Victory!

139
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
What?!

140
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Super Victory!

141
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
You guys are going to lose the tanker!

142
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Today, I will defeat you!

143
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Super Victory!

144
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I knew that the movie was good.

145
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
You bastard!

146
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
You're not going to drink, are you?

147
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Shut up!

148
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Get out of the way!

149
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Today, I will avenge my uncle!

150
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Your uncle?

151
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Your uncle?

152
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
What?

153
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
What? That's the end?

154
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
No way!

155
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Let me explain.

156
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
The Master of Super Victory is a well-known martial artist.

157
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
He is one of the world's top three masters of martial arts.

158
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
He defeated Mugyu with his Seiken.

159
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
He broke the neck of the beer bottle with his sword.

160
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
He fought against the enemy with his pinky.

161
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
There are many legends about him.

162
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:26,000
They are called by their names, such as Ushigoroshi, Beer Bin, and Yubi no Koyubi.

163
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Also, there are 3 million disciples all over the world.

164
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:35,000
They are called by their names, such as God Hand, with the thought of respect.

165
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
After the war, after the war, there were many fights in the dark.

166
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,000
They fought one after another, and were called the Fighting Brigade.

167
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,000
However, after that, they returned to the mountains for three years.

168
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,560
When you want to drink, want to hug a woman,

169
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,440
and your heart is so empty,

170
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,160
you can shave off one eyebrow with a razor,

171
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,120
and you can't appear in front of people.

172
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,040
You can't get out of the evil spirit,

173
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:04,120
so you can be called a one-eye for a while.

174
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,560
I'm not sick.

175
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,160
I'm fine.

176
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,400
I'm a super-victory.

177
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,520
Doctor!

178
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,600
Please help me!

179
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,480
Doctor!

180
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,480
Unzuru Denai...

181
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,480
Master! Master!

182
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,480
There are so many of them!

183
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,480
Master's breath has stopped!

184
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,480
Unzuru Denai Super Victory...

185
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,480
Master! Master!

186
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,480
Master's breath has stopped!

187
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,480
Unzuru Denai Super Victory...

188
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:43,480
Super Victory, take my revenge!

189
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,480
Old man!

190
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,480
It's long.

191
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,480
It's really long.

192
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,480
You're sweating like a Super Victory.

193
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,480
Your sweat is coming out from your pants.

194
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,480
The color has changed.

195
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,480
No way.

196
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,480
Wow, here it comes again!

197
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,480
It's coming out again.

198
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,480
I don't know what it means.

199
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,480
I've never heard it.

200
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,480
It's not a song of Shizuoka, is it?

201
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,480
Ah, I don't know.

202
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,480
I don't know anything.

203
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,480
How much of this skill does he have?

204
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,480
How much of the singing ability does he have?

205
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,480
I don't know.

206
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,480
Heart us open new

207
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:30,720
Listen

208
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:36,140
author?

209
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:43,960
that's his original song

210
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,840
I sometimes saw my eyes in a lie

211
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,380
Always match

212
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:54,380
Happy, happy, happy!

213
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:56,380
It's a perfect match, isn't it?

214
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:58,380
It's before the battle, right?

215
00:10:58,380 --> 00:10:59,380
Yes, before the battle.

216
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:00,380
The explanation of the master is...

217
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:02,380
It's back to normal.

218
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:07,380
I will definitely avenge you!

219
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:08,380
What?

220
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:12,380
I am the devil's grudge!

221
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:15,380
I've never seen a devil like that.

222
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:18,380
Definitely!

223
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:20,380
This is the Devil's Sword.

224
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:22,380
This is the Devil's Sword.

225
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:24,380
What is this Devil's Sword?

226
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:26,380
Let me explain.

227
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:30,380
The Devil's Sword is the Don of the Kaijin Clan.

228
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:33,380
It is a three-dimensional martial arts master of the Kaijin Clan.

229
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:36,380
He killed Buffalo with one punch.

230
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:39,380
He cut the neck of the plastic bottle with a chopper.

231
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:42,380
He fought with his index finger.

232
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:44,380
There are many legends.

233
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:46,380
He killed Buffalo.

234
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:50,380
and the finger of the hand.

235
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:55,380
Also, there are 2.7 million kaijin who were raised by one person.

236
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:59,380
They are called Godfather,

237
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:01,380
with respect.

238
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:05,380
After that, they go into the mountain for three years.

239
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:08,380
When they want to drink, want to hug a kaijin,

240
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:11,380
and when they are so excited,

241
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:14,380
they cut off one of their tentacles with scissors.

242
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:21,380
He became a monster that cannot be seen in public, and after he chased away the evil spirits, he was called a shoulder-choking for a while.

243
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:23,380
He's an idiot.

244
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:28,380
He's an idiot for saying such things.

245
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:30,380
He can't study.

246
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:32,380
He can't study.

247
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:36,380
Don't worry.

248
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:39,380
Black Zorg, I'm fine.

249
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:41,380
Are you okay, Devil 4?

250
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:46,380
I can't believe my love for Super Victory is being destroyed.

251
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:48,380
Are you okay?

252
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:53,380
Devil Sword! Devil Sword!

253
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:55,380
Don't worry.

254
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:57,380
Black Zorg.

255
00:12:57,380 --> 00:13:03,380
But I can't let Super Victory be destroyed like this.

256
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:04,380
Are you okay?

257
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:09,380
Devil Sword! Devil Sword!

258
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:14,380
You bastard! Show me your face!

259
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:19,380
Take my revenge!

260
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:22,380
Devil Sato! Devil Sato!

261
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:30,380
What a stupid show!

262
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:34,380
No way!

263
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:36,380
I don't think so.

264
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:46,380
The song has changed a bit.

265
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:47,380
It has.

266
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:49,380
I've never heard it before.

267
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:53,380
This is it.

268
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:57,380
Ballad version.

269
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:59,380
That's what it is.

270
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,380
What the hell?

271
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:08,380
I'm looking at you.

272
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:13,380
What the hell?

273
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:19,380
I don't know which way I came to see.

274
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:21,380
I came to see this person's face.

275
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:22,380
Hey!

276
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:29,380
What's up, Eden?

277
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:32,380
He's here.

278
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:35,380
You're the reason why the terrorist is dead!

279
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:37,380
I'll never forgive you for this!

280
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:39,380
I won't lose to a villain like you!

281
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,380
Hey, don't be so mean!

282
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:43,380
Please, don't be so mean!

283
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:44,380
Hey, hey, come on!

284
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:45,380
Yes?

285
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:47,380
Come on, come on!

286
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:52,380
You can do it, Kamiya.

287
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:54,380
If you're a hero, you should do action.

288
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:56,380
Action, action, let's go!

289
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:59,380
You can't kick or punch like you explained.

290
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:01,380
You can't kick or punch like you explained.

291
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:08,380
I won't forgive you!

292
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:10,380
I'll kill you!

293
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:15,380
I'm going to use my power!

294
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:19,380
This technique is to pull your body!

295
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:22,380
What? Damn!

296
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:24,380
Then, take this!

297
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:26,380
Wow!

298
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:28,380
Ah!

299
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:30,380
Ah, my body is pulling my power!

300
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:35,380
This technique is to pull your body!

301
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:37,380
You're a fool!

302
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:39,380
Now, let's go!

303
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:44,380
Now, you!

304
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:49,380
You will return the power that I have absorbed to you!

305
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:52,380
I will not give up!

306
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:55,380
This is a battle of the century.

307
00:15:55,380 --> 00:16:03,380
This is the technique of returning the power that you absorbed to you!

308
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:06,500
Take on my power and suck it back from inside myself!

309
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:09,540
what happened?

310
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:10,740
I was sucked back into myself...

311
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:14,100
I was sucked into the energy being sucked back and sucked many time...

312
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:19,540
This and that couldn't suck me back and sucked me back up!

313
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:25,540
This and that can't suck up!

314
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:25,940
Here, you can take on the kasuma

315
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:41,100
I'll return if you'm buying or giving back what you

316
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:50,840
were unp None to the

317
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:51,840
I'm done with you!

318
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,840
Get lost!

319
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:58,840
I have a secret weapon that can defeat you in one blow!

320
00:16:58,840 --> 00:16:59,840
What?

321
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:03,840
Take this! Super Thunder!

322
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:09,840
My penis is being torn apart!

323
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:13,840
Your penis is being torn apart.

324
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:14,840
You should go to hell!

325
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:16,840
You're so stupid.

326
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:20,840
What?

327
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,840
The chinchin is not torn apart.

328
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:23,840
What?

329
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:27,840
The power increased by coming back from the edge of hell.

330
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,840
What?

331
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,840
Take this!

332
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,840
Devil Echustream!

333
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:37,840
I know!

334
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,840
The chinchin is torn apart!

335
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:41,840
Why are you laughing?

336
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,840
What are you talking about?

337
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,840
I feel like my penis is going to break!

338
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:49,840
You're so clingy!

339
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:53,840
I'm not in the serious mode!

340
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:54,840
What?

341
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,840
I'm going to be serious from now on!

342
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,840
Galaxy Mosquito!

343
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,840
My penis is itchy!

344
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,840
I want my penis to be covered in meat!

345
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,840
Give it back!

346
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,840
You're so weak!

347
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:12,840
What?

348
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:14,840
Take this!

349
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:16,840
Let's go!

350
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:17,840
What?

351
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:27,840
How's this?

352
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:28,840
Not yet!

353
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,840
I'll do this again.

354
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,840
What?

355
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,840
What is this?

356
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,840
It's over.

357
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,840
It's over.

358
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,840
Okay, everyone.

359
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,840
How was the story so far?

360
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,840
Do you understand?

361
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,840
What will happen to these two?

362
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,840
I'm curious.

363
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,840
I would like to take a break here.

364
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,840
It's over.

365
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,840
It's over.

366
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,840
Are you enjoying it?

367
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,840
It's long.

368
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,840
It's long?

369
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,840
There are many places I don't want to go.

370
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,840
I'm a child.

371
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:47,840
I think I'm saying too much about the new girl.

372
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,840
Is it okay to say that?

373
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,840
I think it's better to say that.

374
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,840
Anyway, I don't think it's good to say that to a hero.

375
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,840
That's right.

376
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,840
It's a hero award.

377
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:04,840
I realized that there is a limit to the number of hero books if there are two people.

378
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:08,840
I have a request.

379
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:11,840
I can't ask you to help me with the hero book.

380
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:15,840
That's...

381
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:19,840
I don't know. We came here to play badminton.

382
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,840
But it's a really simple role.

383
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:26,840
I'd like to ask Hamada and Tanaka to play the role.

384
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:29,840
I have the image of a role.

385
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,840
Why?

386
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,840
Really?

387
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,840
Yama-chan?

388
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,840
I have the image of a role.

389
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,840
I see.

390
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,840
But I understand badminton.

391
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,840
Then I'll go.

392
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:44,840
Thank you.

393
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:45,840
Please do it.

394
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:46,840
Please be happy.

395
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:47,840
Thank you.

396
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,840
Is it a good time?

397
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:57,840
We will show you the power of Black Sphere!

398
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:01,840
Hey, don't be so stingy!

399
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:05,840
Hey, you have to cheer for us!

400
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:09,840
Victory Lady! Victory Lady!

401
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,840
You came, Victory Lady!

402
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:17,840
I can't see it.

403
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,840
I can't see it either.

404
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:20,840
You can't see it.

405
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:24,840
Don't shoot the strawberry flash!

406
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,840
I can't see it.

407
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,840
I did it.

408
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:34,840
Give it back to me!

409
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,840
No!

410
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:39,840
I'm losing energy from my penis.

411
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,840
What are you doing?

412
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,840
I can't do it like this.

413
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,840
Everyone, give me power!

414
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:52,840
Everyone, if you don't do anything, Super Victory will be destroyed!

415
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:56,840
Everyone, please give a shout out to Super Victory!

416
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:58,840
Ready, set...

417
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:02,840
Ganba!

418
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:05,840
Even bigger friends, more, more!

419
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:08,840
Then, Super Victory will lose!

420
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:11,840
Ready, set...

421
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:15,840
Ganba!

422
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,840
No! I can't reach it!

423
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,840
Look! Evil always wins!

424
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,840
Super Victory lost?

425
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:30,840
Why did Super Victory lose to Black Zoology?

426
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:34,840
Because everyone's support wasn't enough.

427
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:40,840
Let's practice to make a louder voice than usual.

428
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:41,840
I'm angry.

429
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,840
Well then, everyone, goodbye!

430
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:46,840
It's over?

431
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:47,840
It's over?

432
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:53,840
Huh?

433
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,840
The lady's left behind?

434
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,840
The lady's left behind?

435
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:58,840
Don't look at the lady over here.

436
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,840
I can't look at the lady.

437
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:02,840
It's over.

438
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:03,840
The show's over.

439
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:04,840
It looks like it's over.

440
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:05,840
No, no, it's weird.

441
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:06,840
Wait a minute.

442
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:07,840
Victory.

443
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:11,840
It's strange that you are pulling me so much.

444
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:12,840
Thank you.

445
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,840
Let's do it again.

446
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:15,840
You are going to miss it.

447
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,840
Sorry, I'm in the room since 7.

448
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:19,840
This room?

449
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:20,840
Yes.

450
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:21,840
Thank you.

451
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:22,840
Thank you.

452
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:23,840
Thank you.

453
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:24,840
Thank you.

454
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:26,840
What? Is that a team?

455
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:27,840
I think so.

456
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,840
What is this?

457
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,840
I feel like I was told to do this.

458
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,840
I can't watch it.

459
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:38,840
I can't watch the ladies.

460
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,840
What are we going to do?

461
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,840
I don't know. Let's do the badminton.

462
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,840
Let's do it.

463
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,840
Let's do it.

464
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,840
We'll do it.

465
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,840
Can you do it?

466
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,840
Go! Go! Shiodome Jamboree!

467
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,840
It's fun! Come here everyone!

468
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,840
The kids' booth is being held on Japanese TV.

469
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:06,840
We have prepared various devices for you to see.

470
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,840
What is this?
