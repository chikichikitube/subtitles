1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
I don't know how to use the side of downtown.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Ganbatchan Gakurenbo!

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
So, Hamada-san.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Today, we're going to show you the mansion of Ohashi Kyosen.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
This is Mr. Kyosen's mansion?

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Actually, this is a model room.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
And look at this, everyone.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
We have a gorgeous guest today.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I'd like to introduce him to you later.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
First of all, I'd like to introduce you to Mr. Namikoshi.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
He's here again.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
He was hiding in the car the other day.

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
And he's here again this week.

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
And this is my aunt Komori.

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Hello.

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
This is your first time here.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Actually, it's my aunt's birthday today.

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Oh, really?

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
No, no, no, no, aunt.

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Congratulations.

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
He's got a big heart.

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm going to help you.

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm going to hide you.

24
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Oh, really?

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Hamada-san is going to find you.

26
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
So, please remember his face.

27
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
No, no, no, no, no, no.

28
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Okay?

29
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
For the time being, that's the way he is.

30
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I did it.

31
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I did it.

32
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Honestly, I don't know what this is.

33
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Really?

34
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I don't know.

35
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Why is it in this house?

36
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Well, even my family doesn't know what this is.

37
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
It's expensive.

38
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Wow, amazing.

39
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
He's definitely licking it.

40
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Excuse me.

41
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
He's standing up seriously.

42
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
He can't move.

43
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
If you don't touch it, you can't feel the skin.

44
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
It's a well-made picture.

45
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Whose work is this?

46
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
This is Komori's aunt.

47
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
It's a self-portrait.

48
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
That's right.

49
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
She's 82 years old.

50
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
It's a well-made picture.

51
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
It has a three-dimensional effect.

52
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
It's amazing.

53
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
But he can't move at all.

54
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
He can't move at all?

55
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Yes, even if you put your fingers in his nostrils.

56
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Really?

57
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
This is amazing.

58
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:45,000
The second floor is amazing, too.

59
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
He can't move at all.

60
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Who are you?

61
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I've been following you for a while.

62
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I've been here twice, so I've been following you.

63
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Up to this point, it's easy.

64
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
But from here...

65
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
This is good.

66
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
What are you doing?

67
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I'm just asking you to follow me here.

68
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I can't believe we're sleeping together.

69
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Which room is this?

70
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
It's a scary house.

71
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I hear something.

72
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
What are you looking for?

73
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
What are you looking for?

74
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
He's laughing.

75
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
He can't hide, but he's laughing.

76
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
What are you looking for?

77
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I hear something.

78
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
He's still laughing.

79
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
What are you doing?

80
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I hear something.

81
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
The teacher is amazing.

82
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
He's waving his hand.

83
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Wave your hand.

84
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Wave your hand.

85
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Wave your hand.

86
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
That's how it is.

87
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
It was hard.

88
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
It was a great success.

89
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
The old man and the old woman did it.

90
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Thank you.

91
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
It was fun.

92
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Thank goodness.

93
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
It's a big hall.

94
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
It's a big hall.

95
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
It looks like it's going to last a few months.

96
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
It's true.

97
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I know you're cheating.

98
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Don't come out and leave in three seconds.

99
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
He's here to see you.

100
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Even though he's a fan,

101
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
he doesn't like it when you take a lot of tours.

102
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Even though he likes you.

103
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
If it's a girl he likes, he'll eat her poop.

104
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
What should we do?

105
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
This is my first time.

106
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
It's Ginza.

107
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
There's a lot of girls here.

108
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
The girl from the club.

109
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
There is.

110
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I've never been to a club in Ginza.

111
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
It's very expensive.

112
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
What do you think?

113
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Nan-chan seems to be going there.

114
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Have you been to Okamabaya?

115
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Yes.

116
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I've never been to Okamabaya.

117
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
What are you doing?

118
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Wait a minute.

119
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I've been to a lot of good places.

120
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I've been to a lot of good places.

121
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I thought you were coming.

122
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I'm not coming.

123
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I'm not coming.

124
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
You don't have to reply like that.

125
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
What do you think?

126
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Is it fun?

127
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
That's what you know best.

128
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I don't know.

129
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I've never been to such a beautiful place.

130
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
It's an old place.

131
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
It's been in Osaka for decades.

132
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,000
It's an old Okamabaya bar that was made when it wasn't called New Home.

133
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I've been there.

134
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
It's amazing.

135
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
It's an old man.

136
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
It's an old man.

137
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
It's an old man.

138
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Come on.

139
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I can't make a voice.

140
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Welcome.

141
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I've been there.

142
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I've never been to an Okamabaya bar, but I know a place where Okamano Mama is.

143
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Why do you keep saying Okamano Mama?

144
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I like it.

145
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I'll sing it like a river.

146
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Like a river.

147
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I can't make a voice.

148
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I can't make a voice.

149
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I've been there.

150
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I've been to Osaka.

151
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I've been to the theater.

152
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I'm 2 meters tall.

153
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I'm a real Okamano.

154
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I'm wearing a rubber mask.

155
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I'm a real Okamano.

156
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I'm a real Okamano.

157
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I'm a real Okamano.

158
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I'm a real Okamano.

159
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I'm a Hamada fan.

160
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I'm a Hamada fan.

161
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I'm always told,

162
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I'm a Hamada fan.

163
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
It was a year or two ago.

164
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Give me your autograph.

165
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Where's Hama-chan?

166
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
You're so cute, Hama-chan.

167
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
It's scary.

168
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
In the past, there was no Okamano on the street.

169
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
There are a lot of foreigners.

170
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
There are a lot of foreign roadside shops.

171
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
They sell a lot of things.

172
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
They sell unbelievable things.

173
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
When I came to Ginza,

174
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I was wearing a penguin umbrella.

175
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
What's that?

176
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
What's that?

177
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
It's a huge one.

178
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
It's a penguin face.

179
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
It has wings.

180
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
It looks like a hat.

181
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Who would buy it?

182
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I've never seen anyone walking with an umbrella.

183
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I know they sell it.

184
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
It was raining heavily.

185
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
The yakuza didn't have an umbrella.

186
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
What should we do?

187
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
We had to use an umbrella.

188
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
That's all we had.

189
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
But we were yakuza.

190
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
That's not cool.

191
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
It's not cool.

192
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Give me that.

193
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I want to try it.

194
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I want to try it.

195
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
There's this thing.

196
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I was shopping on the phone.

197
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I was shopping on the phone.

198
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
It's a Nico Nico Poon blanket.

199
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
You can't go inside.

200
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
It's a Nico Nico Poon.

201
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I was wearing a yakuza umbrella.

202
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I was shopping on the phone.

203
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
It's a Nico Nico Poon blanket.

204
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
You can't go inside.

205
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
You can't go inside.

206
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I saw you wearing a blanket.

207
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
It's cold in the morning.

208
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
It's cold in the morning.

209
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
You should wear a blanket.

210
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
It's not that way.

211
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
It's not that way.

212
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
There's a collar attached to the blanket.

213
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
There's a collar attached to the blanket.

214
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
And there's a cotton ball attached to the blanket.

215
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
It feels really good.

216
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
There's a blanket with a collar attached to it.

217
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
The man is like, this feels really good.

218
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I can't believe it.

219
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Yeah, I think about it a lot.

220
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Right now,

221
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
something big is coming, right?

222
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
What?

223
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Something big.

224
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
A huge mountain.

225
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
That mountain,

226
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I don't know what it is,

227
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
it's coming towards us.

228
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
It's moving on its own?

229
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
It's moving on its own.

230
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Right now,

231
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I don't know if we should blow it up with a missile or not.

232
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Right now, we can't do anything.

233
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Why can't you do anything?

234
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
If you look at the situation, you won't understand.

235
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Maybe the mountain is great,

236
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
but the sea around it is melting little by little.

237
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
When you look at it, it might look like this.

238
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
There's a big incident, right?

239
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Incident?

240
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
There's also the destruction of the ozone layer.

241
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
This is difficult.

242
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
What does this mean?

243
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Let's ask him.

244
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
The destruction of the ozone layer,

245
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
what is it?

246
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
What?

247
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
What is the ozone layer?

248
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
The ozone layer is in the atmosphere.

249
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
It's in the atmosphere.

250
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:34,000
It's something that has to be there.

251
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
If it's there,

252
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
if it's in a good condition,

253
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
It's in a good condition?

254
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
What do you mean by a good condition?

255
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
If it's there,

256
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
it's in a good condition.

257
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I see.

258
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
The ozone layer is there when you do it.

259
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
When I can't do it, I can't do it.

260
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Just leave it as it is.

261
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
The temperature rises.

262
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
What?

263
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
The temperature of the entire Earth rises.

264
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Because of the destruction of the ozone layer.

265
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
That means, if you keep doing this, it will be over.

266
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I can't do this anymore.

267
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I can't do this anymore.

268
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
This is a big problem.

269
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
If the temperature rises,

270
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
a lot of people will come out, right?

271
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Is that so?

272
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
That's right.

273
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:29,000
The electric products will probably stop selling.

274
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Why?

275
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Why?

276
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
The temperature is rising.

277
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
If it's like that, don't cool it down.

278
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
See?

279
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I can't do such a thing.

280
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Why are you suddenly weak?

281
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Why? Don't you understand?

282
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I'm asking because I don't understand.

283
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Maria, please give me a good bouquet.

284
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Give me a good bouquet.

285
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Are you asking Maria for a bouquet?

286
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
There are many things.

287
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
When a person is born,

288
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
is it decided that he will die?

289
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
How old is he?

290
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
When I told you not to die,

291
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
you should have changed your underwear.

292
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Why?

293
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Your underwear is really dirty.

294
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
You shouldn't have done that.

295
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
You are a pervert.

296
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
That was until junior high school.

297
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
You were wearing an unbelievable underwear.

298
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
It's your fault!

299
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
When you were in junior high school,

300
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
you made a record of changing your underwear.

301
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
That's why I made a record with you.

302
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
We were close friends.

303
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:58,000
How many days did you not change your underwear?

304
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Two weeks.

305
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Two weeks?

306
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
We went to the bathhouse together.

307
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
At that time?

308
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
At that time.

309
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I changed my shirt, but I didn't change my underwear.

310
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I didn't change my underwear,

311
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
but when Hamada didn't change his underwear,

312
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I couldn't lose to him.

313
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
So I washed my underwear cleanly,

314
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:24,000
and I still wear stinky underwear.

315
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
You see,

316
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
when I take my underwear off,

317
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I can smell the smell of the underwear next to me.

318
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
It's true.

319
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
It's hard to wear underwear in winter.

320
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I can't stand it if I wear a kotatsu in winter.

321
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I can't stand it.

322
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
It's amazing.

323
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I can't stand it.

324
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I'm serious.

325
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I had an unbelievable underwear.

326
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I couldn't stand it anymore.

327
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,000
So we decided not to change our underwear,

328
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
and we threw it away.

329
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:17,000
We threw away our underwear.

330
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I recently realized that

331
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I think I'm faster than a child who was raised in a poor family.

332
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
What do you think?

333
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,000
There is something special about a poor child.

334
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Poor people get married early.

335
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
They get married early like a Yankee.

336
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Poor people get married early like a Yankee.

337
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Really?

338
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Don't you think so?

339
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Poor people get married early like a Yankee.

340
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
And they are black.

341
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Very black.

342
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Even though they are men,

343
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
they wear red randosels.

344
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,000
It's terrible no matter how many times you look at them.

345
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:08,000
They look at trumpets in the window of a musical instrument store.

346
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,000
They look like William Thoreau.

347
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:19,000
And they are especially red randosels.

348
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:24,000
You are poor.

349
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Do you get married early?

350
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
No, I don't.

351
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Don't say that.

352
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
You are poor.

353
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
No, I'm not.

354
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I'm better than you.

355
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:40,000
How many rooms do you have?

356
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Two.

357
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,000
You have two rooms.

358
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Even if you have a jeepney, you have three chairs.

359
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I was in good shape until I got pregnant.

360
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
After I got pregnant.

361
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Because you are a painter?

362
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Because I'm a painter.

363
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Did your father paint the Soviet Union?

364
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Yes.

365
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
The Soviet Union was like this.

366
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Yes, red and white.

367
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Did he paint that?

368
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Yes.

369
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I don't know anything about that country.

370
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Did he paint all of that?

371
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Did he go crazy?

372
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Yes, he did.

373
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Sometimes I can tell that he went crazy.

374
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Did he continue painting in the fridge?

375
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
He was angry.

376
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
If your father was angry, he would continue painting in the fridge.

377
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Why?

378
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
He was hitting the window glass.

379
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:46,000
He was hitting it like this.

380
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I don't like this.

381
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
My father was like that.

382
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
My father was like that, too.

383
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I didn't ask my father.

384
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
My sister was on the phone for a while.

385
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
She told me to go and paint.

386
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
She brought a knife.

387
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
She was like this.

388
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,000
She was like this.

389
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,000
What is she doing?

390
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
She was sleeping.

391
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
When I woke up, she was getting better.

392
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,000
She looked like she was getting better at night.

393
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:29,000
My father is not cool, so I didn't ask him to get better.

394
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:35,000
The other day, I went to a drama location in Atami.

395
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
When I got on the bus to go back to the inn,

396
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I got on the bus.

397
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I got on the bus.

398
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
It was a fire.

399
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I got on the bus.

400
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
When the wind blew,

401
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I didn't know who was next to me in front of the wind,

402
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
but my cheeks were swollen.

403
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
That's a fire.

404
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
That's a fire.

405
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
That's a fire.

406
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I said,

407
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:00,000
That's the wind in the middle.

408
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I did it to Taishu.

409
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I did it to Taishu.

410
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Bang!

411
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
That's a fire.

412
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
That's a fire.

413
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
That's a fire.

414
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
That's a fire.

415
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Everyone was doing it from the window.

416
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I don't know.

417
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
But there are many people doing it.

418
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Why?

419
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
They asked me to touch my stomach.

420
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I said,

421
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
There are six of them.

422
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Can't you confirm it?

423
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
You have to confirm it.

424
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
You should be the only one who is cold.

425
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:37,000
I have three words that are annoying to me.

426
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I am angry that I am sorry or sorry.

427
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Why?

428
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
No matter how you look at it, you say,

429
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I'm sorry.

430
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
That's a word to belittle someone, isn't it?

431
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
No, you're apologizing.

432
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
You say, I'm sorry.

433
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,000
The more you apologize, the more I like you.

434
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Don't you think so?

435
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
No, you're apologizing for refusing, aren't you?

436
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
That's different, after all.

437
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
And one more thing.

438
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
You don't like being apologized?

439
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Then?

440
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:16,000
At times like that,

441
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
you're being belittled.

442
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Stop it.

443
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Why?

444
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
And you say, I feel sorry for you.

445
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
You say, I feel sorry for you.

446
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
For example, an amateur comes to you and says,

447
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Oh, hello.

448
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Where are you from?

449
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
I'm from Hamada.

450
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Right?

451
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:42,000
And the person in front of you says, I feel sorry for you.

452
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I don't feel sorry for you because I didn't like you.

453
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Well, well, well.

454
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
I understand that.

455
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
But you're not angry at this guy.

456
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I feel sorry for you.

457
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
I feel sorry for your head.

458
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Well, I understand that.

459
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
I don't understand that now.

460
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
No one is angry at you.

461
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
You say, I feel sorry for you.

462
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
I don't feel sorry for you.

463
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
You're a high school student,

464
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
and you don't have any social status.

465
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
You say, I feel sorry for you.

466
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Your social status is much higher than yours.

467
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I have money.

468
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:22,000
You say, I feel sorry for you.

469
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I think that the number of people in Owaru is higher.

470
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Is that so?

471
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Yes.

472
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Do you go to the best stores of the variety show?

473
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Yes.

474
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
That's right.

475
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
In this organization.

476
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Is that so?

477
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Yes.

478
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:49,000
But I haven't seen that kind of thing.

479
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
And the person who wants to see it.

480
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Japanese writing.

481
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Everything is the same.

482
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
And the venue.

483
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Please use it.

484
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
What is it?

485
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
The person who says it's free.

486
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
All of them.

487
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I'll go anywhere.

488
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
If you send it now, I'll pick it up right away.

489
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Right?

490
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
I'm sorry.

491
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I'm going to be caught.

492
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I've been doing it for 10 years,

493
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,000
and I've made a stupid mistake.

494
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Well, see you next week.

495
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Thank you very much.
