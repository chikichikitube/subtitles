1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
The 1st Gaki no Tsukai Arrangement 100th Anniversary Live Broadcast Special!

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
And, Suga-chan!

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
And thank you, Suga-chan, and goodbye!

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
The 1st Gaki no Tsukai Arrangement 100th Anniversary Live Broadcast Special!

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Now, Masato-kun.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:26,500
Yes.

7
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:27,000
Let's go.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Yes.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
What the hell!

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
So, that's what it is.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Yes, yes, yes.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:37,500
100th Anniversary.

13
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:38,000
That's right.

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Well, to commemorate, today is a live broadcast.

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:40,500
Yes.

16
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,000
Starting at 1.40.

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:42,500
Yes, yes, yes.

18
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:43,000
We're doing it.

19
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Will you ask me what the meaning of this is?

20
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,500
Oh, what is this painting?

21
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:49,000
Well, our artist thought of this.

22
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Well, look.

23
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,500
Kan'ichi Omiya.

24
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:53,500
Say it backwards.

25
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:54,500
Kan'ichi Omiya.

26
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:55,000
Yes.

27
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
It's a 1-million-yen-diamond Megakurami, so it's worth 1-hundred-yen.

28
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Don't say such nonsense!

29
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Who thought of this? Who thought of this?

30
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Kid?

31
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
No, it's not me.

32
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:05,500
Eh, Takasu?

33
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:06,000
It's not me.

34
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,500
Who?

35
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:07,000
Motoichi?

36
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:07,500
No, no, no.

37
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:08,000
Who thought of this?

38
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Suzuki?

39
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:09,500
No, it's not me.

40
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,000
What do you mean, who? It's you!

41
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
No, I didn't think of this. Who?

42
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
No, I don't know who.

43
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
It's definitely Kid.

44
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Cover, cover.

45
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:19,500
And then?

46
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:24,000
Kid is still on tour, isn't he?

47
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
That's right.

48
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
And in commemoration of the 100th anniversary,

49
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,500
the staff said,

50
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:31,500
Congratulations on the 100th anniversary.

51
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,000
What is this?

52
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Today is such a big day.

53
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Your birthday cake was big, too.

54
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:37,500
Yes.

55
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:38,000
This is the 100th anniversary.

56
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,500
Well, there's only one.

57
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:40,000
Ah, I see.

58
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Well, it's a simple feeling.

59
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:41,500
Well, it's a simple feeling.

60
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:42,000
Well, it's a simple feeling.

61
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I borrowed it.

62
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Stop it.

63
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Something like this.

64
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
What do you call it?

65
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
It's cold.

66
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Right?

67
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
It's handwritten again.

68
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Well, that's it.

69
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Today is a live broadcast.

70
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Of course, there's only 30 minutes left.

71
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
If we don't go on and on, we won't have time.

72
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
That's true.

73
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Today is also a live broadcast.

74
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
It's a dream live broadcast.

75
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I see.

76
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
This is also a dressing room.

77
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
This is the venue where everyone is coming.

78
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
And Team Zero.

79
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
It's raining in the Kanto region today.

80
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
They're not from the Kanto region.

81
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Is that so?

82
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Let's call them.

83
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Team Zero.

84
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Yes.

85
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
What are they doing?

86
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Yes.

87
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
It's 1 o'clock and 40 minutes.

88
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
What?

89
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
It's 1 o'clock and 40 minutes.

90
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
It's 1 o'clock and 40 minutes.

91
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Team Zero.

92
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Yes.

93
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
You can't hear the audience's laughter.

94
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I can't hear it at all.

95
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
It's slippery.

96
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
It's beautiful.

97
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:05,000
The slippery entertainer is beautiful.

98
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
This program is brought to you by the sponsor you are watching.

99
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Hello, hello, hello.

100
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
No, no, no, no.

101
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Mr. Kyo.

102
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
No.

103
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Now, please.

104
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Mr. Kyo.

105
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Yes, yes.

106
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Yes.

107
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Today.

108
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Yes, yes.

109
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
100 times.

110
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
It's noisy.

111
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I'll show it to you later, so wait.

112
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Yes.

113
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
In this program, we don't show the audience.

114
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
We don't show it at all.

115
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Today, we want to show it to everyone.

116
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
It's special.

117
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Yes.

118
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Hey, sister.

119
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Yes.

120
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Put your underwear on.

121
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Oh, really?

122
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I'll show it to you later.

123
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
So, yes, yes.

124
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I'll go on and on.

125
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Yes.

126
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Today is the 100th anniversary.

127
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
100th anniversary.

128
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
And the time has changed again.

129
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Yes.

130
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
This 1 o'clock and 40 minutes will start.

131
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Today is the last episode.

132
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
That's right.

133
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Yes.

134
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I'll show it to Golden.

135
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
To Golden.

136
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I'll show it at 11 o'clock.

137
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Yes.

138
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Everyone is here.

139
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Yes, yes.

140
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I'm getting my shoes wet.

141
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Are you okay?

142
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I'll be okay this time.

143
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Really?

144
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Yes.

145
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Really?

146
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Okay, so let's do it, okay?

147
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Let's do it together.

148
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
One, two.

149
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
3, 4, 5, 6.

150
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Now.

151
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
That was different.

152
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
What?

153
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I guess the 2nd Par Man won't come here.

154
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
The 2nd Par Man is desperate today.

155
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Is he desperate?

156
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Today, Team Zero is doing the clock with flowers.

157
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Yes, they're doing it.

158
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Really, that single part should be the 2nd Par Man.

159
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
It should be, shouldn't it?

160
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
What's he good at?

161
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
That man is good at drawing.

162
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
He's got a long nose.

163
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
That's right.

164
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
He has a long nose.

165
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Let's do it.

166
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
What is he drawing?

167
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
It's too short.

168
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
It's too short.

169
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
That's too short.

170
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
That's right. What's that guy doing?

171
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
That guy is showing off his balls like he's so proud of himself.

172
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Today, we'll be working hard on that.

173
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
So today, everyone at the venue came to celebrate our 100th episode.

174
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
100 people.

175
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
And then again,

176
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
100 people, with the same look.

177
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
And then, we have a bunch of idiots here.

178
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Alright, camera-san, this is the first time in this program that we've received 100 seats!

179
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
This is the first time we've received 100 seats!

180
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Well, by having these guys here, we've come one step closer to Kin-chan.

181
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Today, we're really like a virtual grand prize, aren't we?

182
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
We're like a virtual grand prize, aren't we?

183
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
We've all come here wearing the same outfit as the 100th episode.

184
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Just by looking at them, it's almost impossible to tell which one is which.

185
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
That's right.

186
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
So we have to look at that side as well.

187
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
That's right.

188
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Let's look at what we're interested in.

189
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
What are you?

190
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
What am I?

191
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
What are you?

192
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
That's right, the 100th episode.

193
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
We are Shin-donburi.

194
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I see.

195
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
There's one that's wearing the same outfit, right?

196
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
The lion, right?

197
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
The lion of the 100th episode.

198
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
The lion of the 100th episode.

199
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
That's right.

200
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
This kid is amazing.

201
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I think this kid is working really hard.

202
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
You're wearing the 100th episode outfit.

203
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I'm wearing the 100th episode outfit all over my body.

204
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Are you stupid?

205
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I think I'm a little stupid.

206
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I'm sorry.

207
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I think I'm a little stupid.

208
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I've come all the way here.

209
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
What about you three?

210
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
What's that?

211
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
What's that?

212
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Say something!

213
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Who told you to keep doing that?

214
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Speak!

215
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Have a talk!

216
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
It's a yaku-don.

217
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
A yaku-don?

218
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I see.

219
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I don't understand what you're saying.

220
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
You saw it, right?

221
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
The 100th episode, right?

222
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
The 100th episode, right?

223
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I see.

224
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
And...

225
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
And you, your girlfriend?

226
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
What?

227
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
The 100th episode outfit.

228
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
What are you talking about?

229
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Are you sleepy?

230
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I think I'm a little ugly.

231
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
What?

232
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I can't think of a face when you say that.

233
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
And...

234
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
And...

235
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
She doesn't sit down.

236
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
She doesn't sit down properly.

237
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Look at her.

238
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
She's a peach.

239
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
She's a peach.

240
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
She's a peach.

241
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
She's a peach.

242
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I can tell.

243
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
What are you?

244
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
You.

245
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
What's the number?

246
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
10-19.

247
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
What's the number?

248
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
What?

249
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I don't know.

250
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I think she's having a head crash.

251
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
You've seen it a lot, right?

252
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
What's the number she gave you?

253
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
You're Hyakumoto.

254
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Wow.

255
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
That's a school uniform.

256
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
You're Hyakumoto?

257
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
You're writing things that are not Hyakumoto.

258
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I see.

259
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
That's a rare name.

260
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Is that so?

261
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
That's right.

262
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
What's behind you?

263
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
These guys are scary.

264
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Hey!

265
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Don't poke me.

266
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
What's that?

267
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
What's that?

268
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
That thing that looks like Frankenstein.

269
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
What's that?

270
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
What's that?

271
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
What?

272
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
What's that?

273
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
What's that?

274
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
What's that?

275
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
What's that?

276
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Is that Boo-chan?

277
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I don't think so.

278
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
What's after that?

279
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
What's after that?

280
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
That hand.

281
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
What's that?

282
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
One hundred.

283
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Go home!

284
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Your hand is red.

285
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
One hundred.

286
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I see.

287
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
What's with you guys?

288
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I'm sorry.

289
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Please go home.

290
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I'm sorry.

291
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I don't want to see you anymore.

292
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
He's crying.

293
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
One hundred percent juice.

294
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
What's that?

295
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Hyakuyobaka.

296
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Hyakuyobaka.

297
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I see.

298
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
The school's...

299
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Salusberry.

300
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Hyakunichiko.

301
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Hyakujite.

302
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Hyakujite.

303
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I see.

304
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I see.

305
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
There are dangerous guys.

306
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I'd like to show you how to do it.

307
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Really?

308
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Yes.

309
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
What's that?

310
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
It's a cake.

311
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
What are you doing?

312
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Who are you?

313
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Who are you?

314
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Say sorry.

315
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Who are you?

316
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Say sorry.

317
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Who are you?

318
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
This is an experiment.

319
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
We've done this show a hundred times.

320
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I thought it would be best for everyone to put out the fire.

321
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I see.

322
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
But the stage is not a comedian, so I can't lift it.

323
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
The stage is not a comedian, so you can't lift it?

324
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I can't lift it.

325
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
So please blow out a hundred people from that place.

326
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
If we all work together, we can do it.

327
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
It's also an experiment.

328
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
That's right.

329
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Now, everyone.

330
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Come on.

331
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Do it.

332
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
One, two.

333
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Blow out.

334
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
One, two.

335
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
You guys stink.

336
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Don't blow out.

337
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Do your best.

338
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Blow out.

339
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
One, two.

340
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
It was delicious.

341
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
It was delicious.

342
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
If you blow out, it will be exciting again.

343
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
If you blow out, it will be exciting again.

344
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Okay, let's go.

345
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
One, two.

346
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
A little more.

347
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
A little more.

348
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
A little more.

349
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
There's a lot of wind.

350
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
He did it.

351
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I wanted to show the viewers that moment.

352
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
But it disappeared.

353
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Now, blow out.

354
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
That's all.

355
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Today, we have a lot of food from the viewers.

356
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Food?

357
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
We'll eat it.

358
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Please bring it.

359
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Here you go.

360
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
What are you doing?

361
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
It was delicious.

362
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I didn't expect you to prepare this.

363
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I ran away from the parking lot this morning.

364
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
You were still like this.

365
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I was still like this.

366
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Hello.

367
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Long time no see.

368
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Thank you for inviting me.

369
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
What are you doing at home?

370
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
You're late.

371
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I'm sorry.

372
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
You're always sleeping, right?

373
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Yes.

374
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,000
What have you been doing since you were carried away by a rope?

375
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Since then?

376
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Say it quickly.

377
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
What have you been doing since then?

378
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Since then?

379
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I've been doing something at home.

380
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
You're noisy.

381
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
You.

382
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
You're so noisy.

383
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I'm glad you're wearing glasses.

384
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
What are you doing?

385
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Thank you very much.

386
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Thank you very much.

387
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:44,000
We're doing this together, but Yuya is the only one.

388
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
He's a regular.

389
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Yes.

390
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I've received a lot.

391
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I have to introduce this.

392
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Is that so?

393
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I've heard about it, but you don't know it, right?

394
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I've received a message.

395
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Congratulations on the 100th anniversary.

396
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:02,000
As a comedian and as a friend, I sincerely support Hama's activities.

397
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Come to my house next time.

398
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
The head of the village isn't angry anymore.

399
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Hayashiya Kobuhei.

400
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Really?

401
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I really came.

402
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Really?

403
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Kobu-chan.

404
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Is that so?

405
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
We're best friends.

406
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
That's strange.

407
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Yes.

408
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
We're very close.

409
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I heard that you were digging and being dug.

410
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Are you stupid?

411
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Are you stupid?

412
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Thank you very much.

413
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I've received a lot of messages.

414
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
That's how it is.

415
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
It's finally time for the main subject.

416
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I've said it before, right?

417
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Everyone watching TV, too.

418
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Today, for those who came to the venue, I have a wonderful present.

419
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
But, I can't give it to everyone.

420
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Only one of these 100 people.

421
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Go home.

422
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
It's a 1 in 100 chance.

423
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
That's the only wonderful thing.

424
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
This is really amazing.

425
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
That's right.

426
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
This is really amazing.

427
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
If I had it, I wouldn't be able to say it.

428
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
It's an expression that can't be broadcasted.

429
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Sharara used to drink tea in the old VTR.

430
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
That's not true.

431
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
It's a wonderful thing.

432
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Everyone said that.

433
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
What?

434
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Ah, I see.

435
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Let's take a look at the clock.

436
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Is that so?

437
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Yes.

438
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Here it comes.

439
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Here it comes.

440
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
It's raining.

441
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Everyone, please go to bed.

442
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
It's almost 2 o'clock.

443
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
What time is it?

444
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Not yet?

445
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
One more minute.

446
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
It's raining a lot.

447
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Yes.

448
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
It was raining during the rehearsal.

449
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
It was raining a lot during the rehearsal.

450
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
They were soaked during the rehearsal.

451
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
When I came back to the dressing room...

452
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Hey!

453
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
When I came back to the dressing room, I took off my raincoat.

454
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I didn't walk like that.

455
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
What are you doing?

456
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Are you all right?

457
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Yes.

458
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I have an injury.

459
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I have water in my legs.

460
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
What?

461
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Don't point at me.

462
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I have to lower my back.

463
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Is that so?

464
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Let's go a little further.

465
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Yes.

466
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
It's already 2 o'clock.

467
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Today is really amazing.

468
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
How many seconds do we have left?

469
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Two seconds.

470
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Let's go a little further after 2 o'clock.

471
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Let's go a little further.

472
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,000
The time is 1.59.30.

473
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
It's a long time.

474
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
The time is 1.59.

475
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
It's a waste of time.

476
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
It's a waste of time.

477
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I can't help it.

478
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
It's 2 o'clock.

479
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
It's not the time to fall.

480
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:17,000
The time is 1.59.50.

481
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I'm counting on you.

482
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
The time is 2 o'clock.

483
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Hurry up.

484
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Hurry up.

485
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
It's over.

486
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
It's 2 o'clock.

487
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
The water was coming out, but I couldn't tell because of my back voice.

488
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
It's okay.

489
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Now, I have a wonderful present for you.

490
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
This is...

491
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Are you really going to do it?

492
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I'm a little nervous.

493
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Everyone, please listen quietly.

494
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Okay?

495
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Don't move.

496
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Until I say yes.

497
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Okay?

498
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Actually...

499
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Actually...

500
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Today...

501
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
What are you laughing at?

502
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
What are you laughing at?

503
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
How should I say it?

504
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Right?

505
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Actually...

506
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Actually...

507
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I have a wonderful present for one person.

508
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
That's right.

509
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Don't move. Don't move.

510
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Even if you say that, I won't take it.

511
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
The chair...

512
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
The chair you're sitting on.

513
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Don't move.

514
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Down...

515
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Don't move.

516
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
It's not down. It's around here.

517
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I said don't move!

518
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
But that's the person who's sitting on that chair.

519
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Do you understand?

520
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Don't take it.

521
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
It's that chair.

522
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
If you don't have it, it's over.

523
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Don't move!

524
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
If you don't have it, it's over.

525
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
To celebrate the 100th anniversary...

526
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Yes.

527
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
The only person you're sitting on...

528
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Under the chair...

529
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Yes.

530
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
There's 1 million yen attached to it!

531
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Look!

532
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Look!

533
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
It's his money!

534
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Find it! Find it!

535
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Look at the back and the sides.

536
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
There it is!

537
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Find it!

538
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:50,000
It's not a lie. It's true.

539
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Yes.

540
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Congratulations.

541
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Show it to me.

542
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Look!

543
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
This is yours.

544
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
It's true!

545
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Wait a minute.

546
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Wait a minute.

547
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
10,000 yen each!

548
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
What do you mean, 10,000 yen each?

549
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
It's no good.

550
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
It's no good.

551
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
We've thought of a lot of presents.

552
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I think this will make them the happiest.

553
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
What's your name?

554
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I'm Sekiguchi.

555
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Sekiguchi-san?

556
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
How old are you?

557
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I'm 21.

558
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Do you work?

559
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Yes.

560
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
It's 1 million yen.

561
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Yes.

562
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
What should I do?

563
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I don't want to!

564
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I invited them.

565
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
You invited them?

566
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Why? Why?

567
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
I invited them.

568
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
What?

569
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I invited them.

570
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
You invited them?

571
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Yes. They called me in the middle of the night.

572
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
They said, let's go to the police station together.

573
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
They said, let's go to the police station together.

574
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
What?

575
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
So?

576
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
They came out fighting with their parents.

577
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
That's 1 million yen.

578
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
What should I do?

579
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
It's no good. It's no good.

580
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
But why did you invite them when I invited them?

581
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
But why did you invite them when I invited them?

582
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
It's no good.

583
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Why did you invite them when I invited them?

584
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Congratulations.

585
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Thank you very much.

586
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
That's good.

587
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
What are you going to do with 1 million yen?

588
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Really?

589
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Of course.

590
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
You can't lie.

591
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Actually, there is one more thing. We will sign it. If you can change it, we will give you 1 million yen back.

592
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Can you ask your girlfriend to sign it?

593
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Pass.

594
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
We will do it in front of you.

595
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
We will do it in front of you.

596
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
We will do it in front of you.

597
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
We will do it in front of you.

598
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
We will give you 1 million yen back.

599
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
What?

600
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
It's a good idea.

601
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Why did you invite them?

602
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
It can't be helped.

603
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
That's why.

604
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Don't say anything. It doesn't matter.

605
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
But I can't help it.

606
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
You can't help it.

607
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
This is the luck of the moon.

608
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
It's the luck of the moon.

609
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
It's the luck of the moon.

610
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Be careful when you go home.

611
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Be careful.

612
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Be careful when you go home.

613
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Really.

614
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Really.

615
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
What are you going to do if you get caught and get hit by a bag?

616
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
I don't know.

617
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Maybe my staff is waiting for you inside.

618
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Be careful when you go home.

619
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Thank you very much.

620
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Congratulations.

621
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
That's it.

622
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Today is the 100th anniversary.

623
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,000
In that sense, he wasn't a normal kid.

624
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
As I said before, it was a wonderful present.

625
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Actually, it was 1 million yen.

626
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
That's right.

627
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,000
I'm sorry to the people who came here.

628
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
That's right.

629
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
It can't be helped.

630
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Your face and body...

631
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
What are you going to do when you go home?

632
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
What am I going to do when I go home?

633
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Are you going to go home like that?

634
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
With a lion's face?

635
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
But the train isn't running, is it?

636
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I'm going to walk home.

637
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
But today, there are people who can go home.

638
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Is that so?

639
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
I'm going to walk home.

640
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I'm going to walk home in a taxi.

641
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
I'm going to walk home.

642
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
This is terrible.

643
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Ignore him.

644
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
I don't know what's going on.

645
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
That's why we've been doing this for a long time.

646
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Starting next week.

647
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Starting next week?

648
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Not starting next week.

649
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Starting from October 20th.

650
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
It will be broadcast at 11 o'clock.

651
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Sunday.

652
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Yes, it will be broadcast at 11 o'clock.

653
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
I hope you will watch it.

654
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Everyone's eyes are getting empty.

655
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
I've been standing for a while.

656
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
You can't sit there.

657
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
You can't get a million yen.

658
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
But you guys,

659
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
ever since I thought of that outfit,

660
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I didn't have any rights.

661
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
When I was thinking of doing this at home,

662
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
I couldn't give you a million yen.

663
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Right?

664
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
No matter what I do,

665
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
I can't get a million yen.

666
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
I hope you will watch it.

667
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
What is this theme?

668
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
It's different from usual, isn't it?

669
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
It's different from usual.

670
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,000
It's the theme of Gin-chan's imagination.

671
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Gin-chan's imagination.

672
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Everyone, thank you very much.

673
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Thank you very much.

674
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Let's meet again at 11 o'clock on Sunday.

675
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:45,000
This program was provided by the sponsor you are watching.

676
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Oh, it's already over.

677
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
That's fast, isn't it?

678
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Goodbye.

679
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Thank you very much.

680
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Goodbye.
