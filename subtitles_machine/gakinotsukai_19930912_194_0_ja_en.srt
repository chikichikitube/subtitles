1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
It's a soccer tournament where you can't play with a child, so you have to play with a child.

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I'm 30 years old.

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I've prepared a cake for you.

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
No, I don't want it.

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I've already seen it.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
First of all,

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm 32 years old.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
It's a celebration of my birthday.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Is that so?

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Soccer, ball, various things.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
That's good.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I've prepared a cake for you.

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Keeper, this is too different.

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Why?

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
This is a big wall.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
This is the same.

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
This is like a condom.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
It's easy to break.

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:19,000
It's easy to break.

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Break!

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I can't go in like this.

22
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Ouch!

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
It's easier to break than to break.

24
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Break!

25
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Throw in!

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Dance!

27
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
You're a keeper, aren't you?

28
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Of course!

29
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Grab it!

30
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Grab it!

31
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Wait!

32
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Go!

33
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
It's okay. It's safe.

34
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Get on the ground and roll.

35
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Hand!

36
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I got it.

37
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Okay.

38
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Get on the ground.

39
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Get on the ground.

40
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Change the ball.

41
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Break!

42
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Break!

43
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Break!

44
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I can't do this.

45
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I'm scared.

46
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I'm scared.

47
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Break!

48
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Break!

49
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Break!

50
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I can't do this.

51
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I can't do this.

52
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Break!

53
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I'm scared.

54
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Hand!

55
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Hand!

56
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I'm scared.

57
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Don't aim at me!

58
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Heading!

59
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Grab it!

60
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I got it!

61
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Hand!

62
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Hand!

63
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Why hand?

64
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Here!

65
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Here!

66
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Hand!

67
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I got it.

68
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
You got it.

69
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Here!

70
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Here!

71
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
It just happened.

72
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
It just happened.

73
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I got it.

74
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I got it.

75
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
One more time.

76
00:04:51,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Here! Here! Here!

77
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Ladies and gentlemen.

78
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Hello. Hello. Hello.

79
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
What do you have?

80
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Hmm.

81
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Hmm.

82
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
The other day...

83
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Yes?

84
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I went to the toilet at TBS.

85
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
To the toilet at TBS?

86
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I was in the toilet.

87
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I was in the toilet.

88
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I was doing this.

89
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I thought I was going to fall.

90
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I looked at the wall.

91
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
It said half way.

92
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I thought,

93
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
and I just saw a poop.

94
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
So I was in the bathroom at TBS,

95
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
and it was all over the place.

96
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,000
No matter how much common sense you have, no matter how much you can study, no matter how much you can do sports,

97
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
the one who puts poop in the toilet is really...

98
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
You shouldn't have been born.

99
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Even if you say that, you're already 30 years old.

100
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I'm 30.

101
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
30?

102
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:22,000
After 30 years, you must have dropped your dad out of the toilet at least once.

103
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
No!

104
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I really haven't.

105
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I've never been next to the toilet.

106
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I don't understand why such a phenomenon happens.

107
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
The toilet is next to the toilet, right?

108
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
That's right.

109
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,000
When I went in a long time ago, there was a toilet in the bathroom.

110
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,000
When I got out of the bathroom, there was someone waiting for me.

111
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
This is a yakuza.

112
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
When I was about to go in, he said, hey, don't spill the poop!

113
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
And then there's the one who spills it, right?

114
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I don't know if I really did it or not, but I didn't want to be born like that.

115
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
So when I was waiting for him to come out, he said,

116
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
It's spilling.

117
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
It's spilling, isn't it?

118
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
That's spilling, isn't it?

119
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I want to say that it's not me.

120
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
That's spilling.

121
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Right?

122
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
It's not me.

123
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I was doing it, and when I did it in front of my clothes, it was spilling.

124
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
There is.

125
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Isn't there?

126
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
There is.

127
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Rather than that, when I was doing it at home and there was no paper,

128
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I went like this, right?

129
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
That's right.

130
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
That's right.

131
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I looked at it, and it was on the road I was walking on.

132
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
It's on the road.

133
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
It's on the road.

134
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
It's on the road.

135
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
It's on the road.

136
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I was walking like this.

137
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
There is.

138
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I don't know anything.

139
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
There's something that's been annoying me lately.

140
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
What is it?

141
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
It's a certain magazine.

142
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
It's a guy who's been looking down on me.

143
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Well, it may be reflected, but it's a family picture.

144
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
That's right.

145
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
That's not it.

146
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
What is it?

147
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Kansai comedy...

148
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
It doesn't say Kansai.

149
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
It says comedy...

150
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
It says comedy... super idol.

151
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Right?

152
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,000
It says, a fool who's been making me sick.

153
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Hello, I'm a fool.

154
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
That's not it.

155
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
That's not it.

156
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
That's not cool.

157
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:53,000
If you do that, you'll be accused of being dumped when you were dating.

158
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I'm saying good things about you.

159
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
What are you saying?

160
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
You're a fool.

161
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I'm actually saying good things about you.

162
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
That's right.

163
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
That's not it.

164
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,000
It's full of lies.

165
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
That's not it.

166
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I'm asking for a Calpis soda.

167
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
It doesn't say matcha.

168
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I've never had a Calpis soda like this.

169
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
That's just a coincidence.

170
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
That's right.

171
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I'm asking for a Calpis soda.

172
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
See?

173
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
According to the magazine, I spilled the Calpis soda.

174
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Matcha, wipe it for me.

175
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
After wiping it for me...

176
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
You're a fool.

177
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
That's not it.

178
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
You're like a teenager.

179
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I'm not a teenager.

180
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
It just says you were a virgin.

181
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
That's not it.

182
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
You were forced to do it.

183
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I've been thinking about it.

184
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I'm not a virgin.

185
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
That's not it.

186
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
You were forced to do it.

187
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
After that...

188
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
After that, it says you were a virgin.

189
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
What?

190
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
She was crying.

191
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
She was forced to do it.

192
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
She was a virgin.

193
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
It hurts.

194
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
She was sad.

195
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
She was crying because she was sad.

196
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
She was happy to be with me.

197
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I was like, what?

198
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
When I thought about it, she gave me 10,000 yen from her wallet and said,

199
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Go home.

200
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
That's not it.

201
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
That's not it.

202
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
She was wandering around the town.

203
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
That's not it.

204
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
She said, bring her here.

205
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Seriously.

206
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
She said, bring her here.

207
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
She said, bring her here.

208
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
It's not about her friends.

209
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
It's not about her friends.

210
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
You should have gone down 100 or 200 steps more.

211
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
It was true, wasn't it?

212
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Go down.

213
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Go down.

214
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
It was true, wasn't it?

215
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
You could see her armpit.

216
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Wait a minute.

217
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Do you remember what you did when you had hair loss?

218
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I remember that.

219
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Is that so?

220
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

221
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Wait, wait.

222
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Wait a minute.

223
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
What is hair loss?

224
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
You don't know much about hair loss.

225
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I got it from someone.

226
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I see.

227
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I understand that.

228
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
That's right.

229
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I didn't do anything.

230
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I didn't do anything.

231
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I didn't do anything.

232
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I didn't do anything.

233
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Why did you do that?

234
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
If I did that, I would have been a victim.

235
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Of course.

236
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I'm a victim too.

237
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I'm a victim too.

238
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
But I'm a victim too.

239
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I got it from someone.

240
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
You can fix it.

241
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
But it takes some time to fix it.

242
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
You can't fix it right away.

243
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I see.

244
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
You can play with it during that time.

245
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I see.

246
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
You can fix it during that time.

247
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
But,

248
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
you can't fix it with sex.

249
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Stop it.

250
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I've never fixed it with sex.

251
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
You can't fix it with sex.

252
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
You can't fix it with sex.

253
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
You can't fix it with sex.

254
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I was in the picture.

255
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I was in the picture.

256
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
That's the picture.

257
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Hey.

258
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
What's that?

259
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
You're the opposite.

260
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I don't know what I should do.

261
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
You're not saying anything.

262
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I don't know what I should do.

263
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:21,000
That's also a memory.

264
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
When you say something like that,

265
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I don't know what to do.

266
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
For example, when it comes to idol songs,

267
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
you say,

268
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I'm a victim.

269
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
But for me,

270
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I was told that.

271
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Even if I'm confessed to,

272
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I don't feel any pain.

273
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
You felt pain yourself?

274
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I'm a member of the group.

275
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I'm also a member of the group.

276
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I don't feel any pain mentally.

277
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I see.

278
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
You were in the picture.

279
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I was in the picture.

280
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I don't think so.

281
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
That story is all a lie.

282
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
What story?

283
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
You came into my house,

284
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
and talked about the carpet.

285
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
That's all a lie.

286
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
But maybe the woman who did it with me,

287
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I don't know if it's true or not.

288
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I'm sorry about that.

289
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I have a sense of guilt.

290
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
But that story is a lie.

291
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I'm sorry about that.

292
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I don't know if it's all a lie.

293
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I have a cell phone.

294
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I used to ride a white car.

295
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
We used to meet in front of Alta.

296
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Why in front of Alta?

297
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
That's strange.

298
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,000
You're on TV,

299
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
but you're in front of a woman and Alta.

300
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I don't understand that.

301
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I'm sorry about that.

302
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
No.

303
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:02,000
We met in front of Alta,

304
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
and we had a date for the first time.

305
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
What are you talking about?

306
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
In that sense, Alta is a good friend.

307
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
It doesn't matter.

308
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
It's a good friend.

309
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,000
It's a good friend.

310
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I don't know about that.

311
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
And in the room,

312
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
we made a secret between the two of us.

313
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
We called each other Tamori.

314
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
What are you talking about?

315
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:38,000
What's the yellow thing coming out of your mouth?

316
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Is it a bad breath?

317
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:45,000
No, I just said, ha.

318
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I've been telling you this for a long time.

319
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I have a bad breath.

320
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I can't say ha.

321
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Do you have a bad breath?

322
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Why do you say ha?

323
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Why do you say ha?

324
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I say it a lot.

325
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Do you say it to say it?

326
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
You don't say ha.

327
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Let's say I'm thirsty.

328
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Are you thirsty?

329
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I came to play in my house.

330
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Are you thirsty?

331
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
No.

332
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Are you thirsty?

333
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Do you want to drink Calpis soda?

334
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I'll take it.

335
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I'll come to the refrigerator.

336
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Why?

337
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Why?

338
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Why do you come to the refrigerator?

339
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Let's say it's a lie.

340
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Don't lie to me.

341
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Cancan.

342
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Ha.

343
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Why?

344
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Why?

345
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Let's say it's a lie.

346
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Let's drink.

347
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I'll drink a lot.

348
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Cheers.

349
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Ha.

350
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Why do you say ha?

351
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I say it a lot.

352
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
You say ha because it's easy to say it.

353
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Why do you say ha?

354
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Why do you say ha?

355
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I say it a lot.

356
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
You don't say ha.

357
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I say ha.

358
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Why do you say ha?

359
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Why do you say ha?

360
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I went to karaoke.

361
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
On a starry night.

362
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Ha.

363
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
It doesn't matter.

364
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
You say wonchu.

365
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
It doesn't matter.

366
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
It's my mother's story.

367
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
It's wonchu.

368
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,000
What?

369
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:05,000
You've lived for 30 years and you've been wonchu.

370
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,000
For example, when are you wonchu?

371
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
For example, you drive a car.

372
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:16,000
A woman jumps out of the car.

373
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
A woman jumps out of the car.

374
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:22,000
You say wonchu.

375
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
You say wonchu.

376
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
You say wonchu.

377
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:32,000
You say wonchu.

378
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Ha.

379
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
You say ha.

380
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
You don't say ha.

381
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Something like that?

382
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
What do you mean by something like that?

383
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
It's because you can't say ha too much in your daily life.

384
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I can't say it too much?

385
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Everyone can't say ha like that, right?

386
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Be honest with me.

387
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
When you say ha in your daily life, what do you mean?

388
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
You went into your room.

389
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
You came back.

390
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
You came back.

391
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Now, where do you say ha?

392
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Up to this point, I've said it five times.

393
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Wait, wait.

394
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
When you get off the elevator, you say ha!

395
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Ha!

396
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Ha!

397
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Ha!

398
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
There's no way that's possible.

399
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Why?

400
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,000
First, when you push the elevator, you say ha!

401
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Ha!

402
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
There's no way that's possible.

403
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
There's no way that's possible.

404
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
But that's a matter of how many times you say it.

405
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
If you say it more, it will definitely come out.

406
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Something like this yellow thing.

407
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Everyone knows that.

408
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
That's right.

409
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Everyone knows that.

410
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Why is the black dog poop that's fallen on the roadside growing hair?

411
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Is it growing hair?

412
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Well, in a sense, it's like this.

413
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Isn't that because it's not completely digested?

414
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
What do you mean?

415
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Is it eating hair?

416
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I...

417
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
I don't even have my own poop.

418
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
You poop, right?

419
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Poop...

420
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
If you poop, people usually flush it out, right?

421
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
There have been quite a lot of dog poops.

422
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,000
At one point, everyone pooped at home.

423
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
They didn't flush it out, they didn't throw it away.

424
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
They put it on the veranda or something.

425
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,000
That's one form of poop.

426
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
What?

427
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
That's one form of poop.

428
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
I'm going to listen to it with all my heart.

429
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
I see.

430
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:47,000
So if you leave the dog poop as it is, it gradually becomes a dog.

431
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,000
That's why you start walking towards the end.

432
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
It's already growing hair.

433
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:03,000
What do you mean by that?

434
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Idiot!

435
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
The final match.

436
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Team Hamada has 8 points.

437
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Team Atsumoto has 0 points.

438
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Team Hamada wins by 8 to 0.

439
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
But it's 0 points.

440
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Let's do a PK match.

441
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
What?

442
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Let's do a PK match.

443
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Okay.

444
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Let's do it.

445
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Listen to me.

446
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I don't know which one was better.

447
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
I don't know either.

448
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Let's do a PK match.

449
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
PK match.

450
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Okay.

451
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I'm counting on you.

452
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Yes!

453
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I can't do it at all.

454
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Be careful with your nose.

455
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I'll do it straight ahead.

456
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Yes.

457
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Like you're scratching it.

458
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Like you're scratching it.

459
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Like you're scratching it.

460
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:09,000
It's big.

461
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Let's go!

462
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Let's go!
