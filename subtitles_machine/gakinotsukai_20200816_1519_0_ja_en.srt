1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The recording of the boy's use.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I can't see that man.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
It's like a white horse.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
White horse?

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
It's like a slipper.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
It's not like that.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
It's no use to beat you anymore.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Today is a special training.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
What are you talking about?

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
What is it?

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
What's that?

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
What?

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Is that a compliment?

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
On the contrary

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
That's not fair

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Are you from the St. Force?

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm so angry!

18
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Stay home!

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
The comedy is not fair!

20
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
That's terrible!

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Really?

22
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
You were staying home, right?

23
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
That's why your Ma is like a house Ma

24
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Now, now!

25
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
That Ma?

26
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
What? You're late!

27
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
What are you doing?

28
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Today, from Osaka...

29
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I called people from Yoshimoto Shinki Station.

30
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
You started from Koke?

31
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Ah, Shinki Station.

32
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Koke is the theme.

33
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Koke!

34
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Don't do it! Don't do it!

35
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Yoshimoto Shinki Station is a place where Koke and Tsukkomi are played to the max.

36
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
This is the Koke of the Shinki Station that Matsumoto mentioned.

37
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Hello.

38
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
What?

39
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Hello.

40
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
What?

41
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I'll cut you down.

42
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:41,000
The iron plate pattern of the famous joke and the one who gets a cramp and cramps all at once.

43
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Matsumoto wants to force the cramp that has completely shifted after making the four of them experience a cramp.

44
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I'm sorry!

45
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
You're wearing a costume!

46
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
That's right!

47
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
You're going to be on stage!

48
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Of course! Go!

49
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Ah, I'm sorry! I'll open the door!

50
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
You're heavy!

51
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Get ready!

52
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Yes!

53
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:51,000
The four men in their costumes, without knowing the story, go to the stage of the new play.

54
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:03,880
Matsumoto checks the four men's

55
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:08,880
The four of them are going to be the ones to make a fool of the new drama.

56
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:11,880
Will they be able to make it?

57
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:16,880
Ah, there are so many customers today, I'm so busy!

58
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,880
I have to work hard!

59
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,880
I'm so happy! I have to do my best!

60
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,880
What's wrong? What's wrong?

61
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,880
What are you doing? You're going to say something weird, right?

62
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,880
What do you mean by that?

63
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,880
I came to return the bowl I brought from the delivery

64
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:49,880
Thank you for your help! I'll make some tea, so take a break.

65
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,880
Thank you! Thank you!

66
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:53,880
It's a call.

67
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,880
I'm busy!

68
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,880
I'm not going to cut it!

69
00:03:58,880 --> 00:03:59,880
Are you taking it?

70
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:00,880
I made a mistake!

71
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:03,880
You made a mistake! You're a customer in Toronto!

72
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:04,880
It's true!

73
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:06,880
It's ringing.

74
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,880
Hello! Thank you! It's a delivery.

75
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:14,880
One tempura udon and one stamina udon.

76
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:18,380
It's a seaweed udon, meat udon, and fox udon.

77
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:21,380
Understood. I'll deliver it right away.

78
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:24,580
Please give me 5 curry rice.

79
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:25,580
What are you doing?

80
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:30,780
It's not the same. You asked for more, didn't you?

81
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,780
I wrote it down, so it's okay.

82
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:33,280
Really?

83
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:37,580
I'm sorry I'm late.

84
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,480
Hanako-chan, you shouldn't be late from the first day.

85
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:44,480
There is a deep reason for this.

86
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,480
My mother...

87
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,480
My mother...

88
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,480
Mother, she passed away?

89
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,480
She didn't wake me up.

90
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,480
What is that?

91
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,480
Listen to yourself!

92
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,480
Do your best!

93
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,480
Yes.

94
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,480
Please go to the car park across the street.

95
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,480
Please work hard.

96
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,480
I'll get in your way.

97
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,480
I'll get in your way, so go home.

98
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,480
Yes, I'm coming.

99
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,480
Are you really going home?

100
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,480
Why did you let him go home?

101
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,480
He went home on his own.

102
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,480
What's up, you two?

103
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,480
I'm Matsuzora from Yoshimoto Kinjo.

104
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,480
Yoshimoto Kinjo?

105
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,480
Who's the owner of this place?

106
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,480
It's me.

107
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,480
You?

108
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,480
You know a guy called Yoshizawa Yutaka, right?

109
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,480
He's my brother.

110
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:36,480
I see. He's been living somewhere since he borrowed money from me.

111
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,120
It's me, Dazai.

112
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:41,280
My brother left here 5 years ago and hasn't come back yet.

113
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,000
Liar! I know you!

114
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:43,840
I'm not here.

115
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,080
What will happen if Yutaka becomes Dazai?

116
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,480
I taught you how to use this guitar that you borrowed earlier.

117
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,800
I'm scared.

118
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,600
All of you!

119
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,200
Take him to the ocean.

120
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,000
No, no, I'm scared.

121
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,360
I'll push him down from the ship!

122
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,720
I'm scared.

123
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,320
A shark will attack you soon.

124
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,040
I'm scared.

125
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,040
Here it comes.

126
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:06,040
I'm scared.

127
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:08,040
I'm scared.

128
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,040
You're going too far!

129
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,040
You're going too far!

130
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,040
Are you okay?

131
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:25,040
If she said that, I wonder how much trouble she would cause by making a debt.

132
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:28,040
Lady, did you see your brother?

133
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,040
Well...

134
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,040
Did he cause any trouble?

135
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,040
I'm sorry.

136
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,040
It's a complicated story.

137
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,040
I want to know.

138
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:40,040
If you work here, can I ask you a favor?

139
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,040
Sorry.

140
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,040
It's okay.

141
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,040
It's okay?

142
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,040
Why are you hitting me?

143
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,040
I'll hit you.

144
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,040
It's okay.

145
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:53,040
Actually, I have a brother named Yutaka.

146
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,040
We're running a store together.

147
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:59,040
Five years ago, Yutaka jumped out of the store and made a sound.

148
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:02,040
I still can't forgive you.

149
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,040
I see.

150
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:06,040
That's what happened.

151
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,040
I'm back.

152
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,040
Yutaka!

153
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:13,040
Sister, I'm sorry for being so hard on you.

154
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,040
Why did you come back?

155
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,040
Wait, wait, wait.

156
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,040
I don't have to say that.

157
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,040
I came back because I had to.

158
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,040
You get angry after listening to me.

159
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,040
Sit down.

160
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,040
Yutaka, what happened?

161
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,040
Actually...

162
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:27,540
Actually

163
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:29,700
You are a fool!

164
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:31,320
You haven't said anything!

165
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,260
You just doubled your answer.

166
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:37,580
Ask the question after they ask it too!

167
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,040
Ex poster

168
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,240
Meeting

169
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,500
I bet it didn't come true.

170
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,720
It wasn't our Drawh!

171
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:45,940
Qualify too

172
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,040
They should have answered after they have asked.

173
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,040
Which one?

174
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:51,440
It was just...

175
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,220
You have to answer too!

176
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,720
What a waste!

177
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,720
What's wrong with you?

178
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,720
You're not even telling me properly.

179
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,720
What happened this year?

180
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:05,720
Five years ago, I became a guarantor for my friend's debt.

181
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,720
That friend ran away.

182
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:12,720
And when I was at this shop, the debtors came and came to disturb me.

183
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,720
So I thought I shouldn't cause trouble, so I left this town.

184
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,720
But if you're going to go back, at least pay off your debt.

185
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,720
You should have come back.

186
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,720
Wait a minute. I paid it off properly.

187
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,720
Why? You said you paid off your debt first.

188
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,720
What's wrong with that? I paid it all back.

189
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,720
I'm back to normal.

190
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,720
You're a movie star, Yasue-chan.

191
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,720
You should go back to this store with Yudaka-kun.

192
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,720
There's no reason to say that.

193
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,720
I don't want to see your face anymore.

194
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,720
Go out!

195
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,720
Onee-chan!

196
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,720
Why are you the one who says that?

197
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,720
While laughing.

198
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:45,720
Why did Yasue-chan say that?

199
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,720
Hey, Yudaka.

200
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,720
You're not going to pay me back?

201
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,720
You're not going to let me pay you back?

202
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,720
Wait a minute.

203
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,720
I paid you back all the money.

204
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,720
You've been a pervert all day.

205
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,720
Give me the 1 million yen!

206
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,720
I can't do that!

207
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,720
I have no choice but to do this!

208
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,720
Hey! Hey! Hey!

209
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,720
Hey! Hey! Hey!

210
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,720
Wait!

211
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,720
What are you doing with a stick?

212
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,720
I didn't do anything

213
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,720
You didn't do anything?

214
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,720
Why did you take the stick?

215
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,720
Today, the lady with the glasses is not here.

216
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,720
Who is that?

217
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,720
What are you doing?

218
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,520
I'll take your sister to the shakky.

219
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,520
No, no, no!

220
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,920
Please, please, please!

221
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,520
Please let me take my sister!

222
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,520
Let me go!

223
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,120
Then pay me!

224
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,120
Ah, I'm sorry!

225
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,320
I'm sorry!

226
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,720
I don't care what happens!

227
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:38,120
Please let me take my sister!

228
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,720
You're acting like a hero.

229
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,920
Hey, Shaku-yo.

230
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,820
No, I haven't returned the rizoku.

231
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:51,220
Forget about the rizoku.

232
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:53,220
Tell your sister about this!

233
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:55,220
I'll get a divorce.

234
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,220
O-Nano!

235
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:00,220
Sister!

236
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:02,220
I'm going to the bathroom.

237
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:21,220
You're so mean!

238
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:23,220
You're so mean!

239
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:24,220
What?

240
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:26,220
I want to clean it up a little.

241
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:29,220
Look, I'm going.

242
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:31,220
Wait a minute, Yutaka-kun.

243
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:36,220
Yasue-chan, can I really let you go?

244
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:41,220
You have nothing to do with this!

245
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:43,220
You're a jerk!

246
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:46,220
Hey!

247
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:49,220
Wait a minute!

248
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:55,220
If you're going to leave, take all your belongings and leave!

249
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:57,220
Wait, Yasue-chan.

250
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:59,100
Your clothes are in the absence factors catchingstein.

251
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:03,620
Yes, I will take them with me.

252
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:08,500
And also tell him to bring your shoes.

253
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:12,380
Okay. I'll take his shoes, too.

254
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,940
And also your blanket. Get everything you can bring anywhere else.

255
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:19,500
Wait a second.

256
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:24,260
Why would you please bring me everything?

257
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:27,260
If I can't go out with you,

258
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:30,260
If I can't go out,

259
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:33,260
I'd rather stay here.

260
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,260
Se-chan.

261
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:36,260
Instead,

262
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:42,260
I'll let you work hard until you get a break.

263
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:44,260
Sister.

264
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:46,260
You're back.

265
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:48,260
I'm so glad.

266
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:51,260
I'm so sorry.

267
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:56,260
I'm sorry. I should have understood you more.

268
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:59,260
No, I should have understood you more about my sister.

269
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:01,260
You weren't nice to her.

270
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:03,260
No, I wasn't nice to her.

271
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:06,260
I'm not nice to her.

272
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:08,260
I told you.

273
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:12,260
You're my brother but you're noisy.

274
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:16,260
You are noisy and you are sulking.

275
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:18,260
You're a fool!

276
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:20,260
You're a piece of shit!

277
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:22,260
You're a piece of shit!

278
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:24,260
What the hell!

279
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:43,260
What did you think of them?

280
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:45,860
It was a good fit, it was familiar.

281
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:47,860
It was a good time.

282
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:49,860
First, Tanaka.

283
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:50,860
Yes.

284
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:52,860
You're just bad at this.

285
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:57,860
You're just bad at this.

286
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:02,860
And Hamada, you didn't have a good reaction for a few episodes.

287
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:03,860
I'm sorry.

288
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:08,860
The last one, the one that you stayed in the open for a long time.

289
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:10,860
I hate that one.

290
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:16,860
I thought that was the end, so I was waiting for him to get off the horse.

291
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:18,860
That's the bad part of being a veteran.

292
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:21,860
That's enough.

293
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:26,860
Overall, he's 0.42 faster than me.

294
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:29,860
0.42 faster.

295
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:32,860
Yamazaki is 1.65 slower.

296
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:34,860
1.65?

297
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:37,860
Endo is 8 seconds faster.

298
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:38,860
8 seconds?

299
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:41,860
Of course, it's not that fast.

300
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:44,860
But that's how fast I felt.

301
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:45,860
I see.

302
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:46,860
It's not done at all.

303
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:49,860
In the first place, it's too broken.

304
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:52,860
It shouldn't be broken no matter what.

305
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:56,860
I'll show you a example.

306
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:57,860
Really?

307
00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:00,860
I'm sorry to the people of the new drama, but I had the same thing done in the previous one.

308
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:02,860
It's not broken at once.

309
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:04,860
In that one?

310
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:12,860
When you absorb all the moss from the plants and when you are done, you will be able to collect all the moss in one go.

311
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:14,860
Then everyone will be happy.

312
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:18,860
That was a lot of moss.

313
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,860
This is the real moss.

314
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:24,860
I will show you.

315
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:26,860
You will learn.

316
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:29,860
You're not allowed to do that!

317
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:32,860
You're not allowed to do that!

318
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:39,860
The four of them are too drunk and they're in a serious situation.

319
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:43,860
They're about to fall in love.

320
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:47,860
Matsumoto is determined to do it at the right time.

321
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:51,860
The four of them are watching from the other room.

322
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:58,860
When will Matsumoto show his true self?

323
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:02,860
He's not here

324
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:03,860
He's not here

325
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:04,860
He's not here

326
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:06,860
I have to work hard today too

327
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:09,860
He's not here

328
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:10,860
He's not here

329
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:13,860
He's not here

330
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:19,860
What are you doing?

331
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:20,860
What are you doing?

332
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:22,860
He had that kind of face?

333
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:23,860
He didn't look like that

334
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:25,860
He was like that

335
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:29,860
I'm Matsuura Yumoe from Yoshimoto Biyuu

336
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:31,860
You know a guy called Yoshizawa Yutaka right?

337
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:33,860
I'm Yuttaka's little brother

338
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:36,860
He borrowed money from us and took a loan

339
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:37,860
Borrowed money?

340
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:38,860
That's right

341
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:42,860
I'm sorry but my brother left 5 years ago and hasn't returned since then

342
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:46,860
You know a guy called Yoshizawa Yutaka right?

343
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:48,860
I'm Yuttaka's little brother

344
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:50,860
He borrowed money from us and tried to steal it

345
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:51,860
Borrowed money?

346
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:52,860
That's right

347
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:56,860
I'm sorry but my brother left 5 years ago and hasn't come back since

348
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:00,860
If you know it, it's no good

349
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:02,860
He's really getting in the way

350
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:03,860
He's getting in the way

351
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:05,860
He's already got a lot of money

352
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:07,860
He's not getting anywhere

353
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:09,860
A shark will attack you soon

354
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:10,860
What does that mean?

355
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:12,860
Here it comes

356
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:16,860
Scary scary scary

357
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:18,860
Here it comes!

358
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:20,860
The makeup is so weak.

359
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:22,860
You're only doing it once?

360
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:24,860
You're so good!

361
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:26,860
You're so good!

362
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,860
You're so good!

363
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:30,860
You're so good!

364
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:32,860
Please go home!

365
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:34,860
You're so good!

366
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:36,860
You're so good!

367
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:40,860
My debt recovery rate is...

368
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:42,860
The next day

369
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:45,860
Zero!

370
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:46,860
Zero?

371
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:48,860
What the hell?

372
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:51,860
What the hell is this?

373
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:55,860
This is in the way.

374
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:59,860
Okami-san, did your brother do it?

375
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:00,860
I don't know.

376
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:04,860
What about the trouble?

377
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:06,860
It's a complicated story, so it's okay.

378
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:07,860
I want to know.

379
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:13,860
Well, that's true. When it comes to work, Yasui-chan, can I ask Hana-chan to teach me?

380
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:15,860
Ah, sorry.

381
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:16,860
It's fine.

382
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:20,860
It's fine? Why did you hit me?

383
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:22,860
What?

384
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:25,860
He's the best note.

385
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:26,860
It's true, right?

386
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:27,860
It's true.

387
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:28,860
It's true.

388
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:29,860
Ryuu-kun, Ryuu-kun.

389
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:33,860
I'm back.

390
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:34,860
That's strange.

391
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:35,860
Yutaka!

392
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:36,860
That's strange.

393
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:39,160
I'm sorry for being a fool

394
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,860
Why don't you say something?

395
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:42,160
Why did you come back?

396
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,160
Yasue-chan, don't say that

397
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,860
You'll get angry when you hear the truth

398
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:48,860
What happened? Sit down

399
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:50,860
Sit down

400
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:52,860
Don't listen to the story

401
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:53,860
You'll get angry

402
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:56,860
Reitaka-kun, what happened?

403
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:59,860
Actually...

404
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:00,860
Don't say that

405
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:02,860
I didn't say anything yet

406
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:04,860
You'll get angry when you hear the truth

407
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:06,860
Yutaka-kun, what happened?

408
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:08,860
Actually...

409
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:09,860
You're lying!

410
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:10,860
Yasue-chan too!

411
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:11,860
Yasue-chan too?

412
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:09,540
What's with the

413
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,860
Yutaka-kun, what happened?

414
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:17,860
Actually...

415
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:18,860
That's what happened.

416
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:19,860
What's that?

417
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:21,860
You too?

418
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:23,860
You too?

419
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:26,860
You're the one who's not saying it properly!

420
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:28,860
What happened?

421
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:32,860
Five years ago, my friend's loan was in debt,

422
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:34,860
My friend ran away.

423
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:37,860
And I had to pay back the debt.

424
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:41,860
When I was at the store, the debt collector came and tried to get in my way.

425
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:44,860
He said I shouldn't have been in trouble, so I left the town.

426
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:45,860
I see.

427
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:49,860
So you didn't have to be in trouble, so you left the town.

428
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:53,860
But if that's the case, you should have paid back the debt before coming back.

429
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:55,860
I paid back the debt properly.

430
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:57,860
What are you talking about? The debt collector came earlier.

431
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:59,860
I paid back all the mistakes.

432
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:00,860
There's no mistake.

433
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:04,360
That's fine. But Yase-chan, can you go to this shop with me again?

434
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,360
I can't.

435
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:11,360
This girl left this shop just for me.

436
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,360
I can't do that.

437
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,360
I don't want to see her face.

438
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:15,860
Get out!

439
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:17,360
Onee-chan!

440
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,860
You're the one who should say it!

441
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:20,860
No, Kanji is in the right place.

442
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:23,860
This is a troublesome topic.

443
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:25,360
Hey, Yutaka!

444
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,860
You're back!

445
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:29,360
Matsuura-san, I've paid you back for the money.

446
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,760
Hey, you're the one who gave me the most change in the world.

447
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,160
The world's fastest one million yen!

448
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,160
Pay me properly.

449
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,960
I can't pay that much!

450
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,960
Then, I guess I'll have to do this!

451
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:40,360
Hey, hey, hey!

452
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,960
Wait, wait, wait!

453
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,360
What are you doing, doko?

454
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,160
Hey, hey, hey!

455
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,660
What are you going to do with a naked woman?

456
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:48,560
I didn't do anything, though.

457
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,360
What did you do, doko?

458
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:52,060
You didn't do anything?

459
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:53,160
What are you doing?

460
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,160
What are you looking at?

461
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,160
Hey, get out of here.

462
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:59,160
What are you doing?

463
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,160
What are you doing?

464
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:03,160
Hey, this is bad. This is about the debt.

465
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,160
Your sister is in debt.

466
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,160
Wait a minute.

467
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,160
Please don't take my sister.

468
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,160
You have to pay for it.

469
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,160
Hey, wait a minute.

470
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,160
I don't care what you do.

471
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:17,160
Please don't take my sister's debt.

472
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:21,160
You're so stubborn.

473
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,160
What kind of face is that?

474
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:25,160
Hey, come on.

475
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:30,160
Shakuya-san, I'm sorry to say this but...

476
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:38,160
No more reasoning! This time, I'll get back at your sister for having a reason.

477
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,160
What kind of face is that?

478
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:42,160
You're so full of yourself.

479
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:44,160
It's already the end.

480
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,160
Right? It's already over.

481
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:48,160
Yes, it's over.

482
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,160
It's already around here.

483
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,160
That's right.

484
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,160
There's still a chance.

485
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,160
It's over.

486
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,160
It's over.

487
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:00,160
Are you kidding me?

488
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,160
What's wrong with you?

489
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,160
This isn't the place.

490
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,160
This is a good place.

491
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,160
I'll wear it.

492
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:08,160
You only have one last word.

493
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,160
Wait a minute.

494
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,160
I was scared.

495
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:14,160
You have to go out.

496
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:17,160
Take all your luggage and get out.

497
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,160
Yasue-chan.

498
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,160
There's a lot of clothes in it.

499
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:24,160
No, you're getting in the way.

500
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,160
You're getting in the way.

501
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:29,160
I'll take your clothes with me.

502
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,160
And...

503
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:36,160
Take your shoes with you to the store.

504
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,160
Okay.

505
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,160
I'll take my shoes with me.

506
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,160
And...

507
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:46,160
There's a futon, so take it with you.

508
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,160
Wait a minute.

509
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:49,160
I'll take my clothes, shoes, and futon.

510
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:52,160
You can't just take everything and leave!

511
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:55,160
If I can't take everything and leave...

512
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,160
If I can't leave...

513
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:02,160
I should just stay here forever, right?

514
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,160
Here?

515
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:06,160
I should just stay here forever, right?

516
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,160
Here?

517
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,160
Here?

518
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,160
No way!

519
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,160
Here?

520
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:13,160
What are you doing here?

521
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:17,160
That's strange.

522
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:19,160
It's so moving.

523
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:21,160
It's not a joke.

524
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,160
It's not a joke.

525
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:25,160
It's not a joke.

526
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,160
Everyone was really surprised.

527
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:29,160
It's like I was defeated.

528
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:35,160
Good work.

529
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:37,160
The 4th place is the new member.

530
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:43,160
We were watching it from the room because it was so good.

531
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:48,160
That's where the brothers' music flows and it's a show place.

532
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:50,160
I said, DOOON!

533
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,160
I was surprised.

534
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,160
I thought, what is this?

535
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:57,160
You don't usually do that kind of voice, do you?

536
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,160
That's right.

537
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:03,160
There is also a story that I was told to do it for the sake of the show.

538
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:05,160
I wanted to ask you.

539
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:07,160
Why is it that way?

540
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:11,160
I've been nodding my head while listening to the lines.

541
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,160
Yes, yes.

542
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,160
He was biting the screen.

543
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,160
Yes, he was biting.

544
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,160
It's a ghost.

545
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,160
It's a ghost.

546
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,160
It's a ghost.

547
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,160
What?

548
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,160
It hurts.

549
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,160
It hurts.

550
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,160
What hurts?

551
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,160
Apologize.

552
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,160
Apologize.

553
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,160
