1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Next time, we'll be back with a new episode of Gagi no Tsukai!

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
He's so kind!

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
What kind of story is this?

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
We've been doing this for a long time.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
We've been doing this for over a month now.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
We asked our staff to be honest with us.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
This is serious.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
We asked them to marry us if they could.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
No, this is a serious story.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Let's go! The contestants are here!

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Please take a seat.

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Why don't you try this on?

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Let's start with a self-introduction.

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Let's go!

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I'm Yoshimoto Kogyo Okamoto.

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm 28 years old.

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm here today to find my girlfriend.

18
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
That's a lame self-introduction.

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm Takasu, the reporter.

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I'm turning 30 this year.

21
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
People around me are getting married soon.

22
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
You guys are so hard!

23
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
What are you talking about?

24
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Is this a documentary?

25
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I'm here to find a woman who will go to the shrine with me.

26
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
That's a good idea!

27
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
You know what you're doing!

28
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
That's what I'm going to say.

29
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
That's what I'm going to say!

30
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
You little brat!

31
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I'm Tsutsumimoto, the director.

32
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I'm Kishin Kinomi.

33
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I'm here to find my girlfriend.

34
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I'll do my best as the representative of the staff.

35
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Lastly, number 5.

36
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
You're so small!

37
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I'm sitting down!

38
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
You're so big!

39
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I'm Saito, the director.

40
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I'm 41 years old.

41
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Please introduce yourself.

42
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I'm Kumiko Takaoji.

43
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Number 2.

44
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I'm Nanase Mizuno.

45
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I'm 24 years old.

46
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I'm Harumi Nakane.

47
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I'm 21 years old.

48
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I'm...

49
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Soap?

50
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Soap?

51
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
What kind of soap is that?

52
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I have a lot of childlike parts.

53
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I like people who are older than me.

54
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Saito is putting on glasses right now.

55
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
There's only one person putting on glasses.

56
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
If you're told you're older than me, I'll give you a hug.

57
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I'm Yoshie Maite.

58
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I'm 22 years old.

59
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I'm a fritter.

60
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I'm Nanami.

61
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I'm Nanami.

62
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Nanami?

63
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Nanami?

64
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
What do you mean?

65
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Everyone can hear you.

66
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Why can't I hear you?

67
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Are you a fritter?

68
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I'm Harumi.

69
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I'm a fritter.

70
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
What kind of fritter are you?

71
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I'm a fritter.

72
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,000
This program is brought to you by these sponsors.

73
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Let's start with the usual.

74
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Question time!

75
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
That's right.

76
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Let's start with the usual.

77
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Is this okay?

78
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Let's go.

79
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
What kind of person do you like?

80
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I like people who are funny.

81
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I'm a broadcaster.

82
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I'm a broadcaster.

83
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I like everyone.

84
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I like funny people.

85
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I like people who make me laugh.

86
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Number two doesn't make sense.

87
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I don't like that kind of person.

88
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I like people who make me laugh.

89
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I like people who make me laugh.

90
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I like people who make me laugh.

91
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
It's very difficult.

92
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Did I ask a question?

93
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I didn't have a good answer.

94
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I like people who are sincere.

95
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I was waiting for an answer like you.

96
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
If you got an answer like you, you'd be in school.

97
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I like Hamada.

98
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I don't need that!

99
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Don't say that!

100
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Don't say that!

101
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
It's fun to be together

102
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Anything else?

103
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Number 3 was quick

104
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
What do you need a woman for?

105
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
This is a difficult question

106
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
It's a severe question

107
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
When you want to feel good

108
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Yes

109
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
What you don't have enough

110
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
That's mean!

111
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
That's mean!

112
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
You're a narcissist!

113
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
That's not true

114
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Kazutaiji said it

115
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Don't say Kazutaiji

116
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I'll say it

117
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I'll ask for something I don't have

118
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
What are you saying?

119
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I'm not happy

120
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I want to be happy

121
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
You're not happy?

122
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
A place to relax

123
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I'll say it

124
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I didn't hear you say it

125
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Basically he's eating rocks

126
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
You can appear in that

127
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
What?

128
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Never ending story

129
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
He's eating rocks

130
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Really?

131
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
For my wife

132
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Number 4

133
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
If you spend Christmas together

134
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
How would you like to be escorted?

135
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Number 1

136
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
From Christmas Eve

137
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
At 12

138
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
We'll meet at my house

139
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
How do you show up?

140
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
By car?

141
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
No, by walking

142
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
By walking?

143
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Yes

144
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
That's a normal Thursday

145
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Why Thursday?

146
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I'll drink champagne

147
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
And go to sleep

148
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
It's Junya's birthday

149
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
You're lying

150
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I'm not

151
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
You're a bad character

152
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
So

153
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
You made a reservation

154
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
For money

155
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
That's true

156
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Super

157
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Super?

158
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Why didn't you make a reservation?

159
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Super

160
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Bar

161
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
On your birthday

162
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
You'll go home

163
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I'll go home

164
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I have an iron plate

165
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I don't know what you're talking about

166
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
You're so bad

167
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I'll make takoyaki

168
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
You have an iron plate

169
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Let's make takoyaki together

170
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
That's right

171
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I have a restaurant

172
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
That I go to

173
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
You have a restaurant

174
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
That you go to?

175
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I'll make a reservation

176
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
At the convenience store

177
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
You can take it home

178
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
You can do it yourself

179
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
You can do it yourself

180
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Christmas party

181
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I've never been to

182
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Disneyland

183
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
You've never been there?

184
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I've never been there

185
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I want you to take me there

186
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Christmas is

187
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
You take me there

188
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
It's like

189
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Men's

190
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Who are you?

191
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I'm a talent

192
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
You're a kid

193
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000

As long as I don't get fired

00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I can live a normal life

201
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000

00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
What?

206
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000

00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I have a store

212
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
You have a store?

213
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000

What do you think?

228
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
It's good

When Kouhaku was on

281
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
He was on a TV show

282
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I don't know why

What kind of panties are you wearing?

315
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I can't see panties

316
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
That's a reward

317
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
That's fine

318
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000

Geisha girls are red

340
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000

What?

344
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
You can't say that

345
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Why do you look like a shimo?

346
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
You can't say that

347
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
You can't say that

Yes, I do.

373
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Which group?

374

Well...

That's right.

378
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I'm almost blind.

379
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Masked wrestler?

380
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Can I ask your name?

381

No, that's...

382
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
If you say that, people will find out.

There's a gathering.

00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I won't quit.

390
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
He's the new president.

391
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Who made this technique?

392
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,000
It was done by Grey and Kojikaga.

393
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
No one knows.

394
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
It became popular in the area.

395
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Is that so?

396
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Yes.

397
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
But it's a magical technique.

398
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
A sealed magical technique.

399
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
It's too dangerous.

400
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I see.

401
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Yes.

402
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
This is related to life and death.

403
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I won't quit.

404
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
You won't quit?

405
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Yes.

406
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
It's similar to eye-killing and kicking.

407
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
It's similar?

408
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
No, it's not like that.

409
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
What do you call it?

410
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
It turns blue.

411
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
No matter what kind of technique you use, it turns blue.

412
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
It hurts.

413
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Even if I go home for a while, it turns blue.

414
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I can't see my wife's eyes.

415
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
If you do that.

416
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
What?

417
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I want to see it.

418
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
It's a technique that turns blue.

419
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I won't quit.

420
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Seiji Sakaguchi said it.

421
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Seiji Sakaguchi said it.

422
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
At first, it was called Sakaguchi-chan.

423
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Sakaguchi-chan?

424
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Sakaguchi-chan.

425
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Tameuchi?

426
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Yes, I did.

427
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Let's get rid of it.

428
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Everyone was against it.

429
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Only Grey and Kojikaga were against it.

430
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
That's right.

431
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
You made it.

432
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I said I wanted to do it, but I thought it was okay.

433
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
So this time, I quit.

434
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Rolling Sobat Express.

435
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Flying, right?

436
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Flying.

437
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I decided to quit.

438
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,000
What kind of technique do you use?

439
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
There are only two of us.

440
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
If I quit, you'll be the one who gets kicked.

441
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
It turns blue.

442
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
I can't see my wife's face when I go home.

443
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
My wife comes out to congratulate me.

444
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
At that time, I can't say anything.

445
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I can't help it.

446
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I want to see it.

447
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
What about the damage?

448
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:27,000
I'll explain the damage in 10 stages.

449
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
This is 9.5 damage.

450
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
What about the rest 5?

451
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
10 is death.

452
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
It came out.

453
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
What?

454
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I touched it.

455
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
What is this?

456
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I told you to set a trap.

457
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
What about now?

458
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
What?

459
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
That was the Sobat Express.

460
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:04,000
What about me now?

461
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
It's a joke.

462
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I was surprised.

463
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Let's fall forward.

464
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Let's fall backward.

465
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Which way?

466
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Backward.

467
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Let's go.

468
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:33,000
When it comes like this, it goes in like this.

469
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:43,000
This is the Flying Express Sobat.

470
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:49,000
That's why I said it.

471
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:54,000
What is the first thing to be careful about when you go to the bank?

472
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Is there anything you have to be careful about?

473
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Yes, of course.

474
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
First of all, you have to be careful when you go to the bank.

475
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
When you go to the bank?

476
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
You have to be careful when you go to the bank.

477
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Avoid Sunday.

478
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Do you mean that there are a lot of people?

479
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
It's not open.

480
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
You should go because it's not open.

481
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
No, no.

482
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I'm talking about the so-called bank robbery.

483
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Be quiet.

484
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I'm talking to Ceron.

485
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Be quiet.

486
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Who are you talking to?

487
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I'm talking to a thief.

488
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
This is the first thing to do when you go to the bank.

489
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I see.

490
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
What should I bring with me?

491
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
What?

492
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
When I go to the bank.

493
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Basically, I don't need anything.

494
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:46,000
What? A wallet?

495
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Are you kidding me?

496
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
What?

497
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
You have to be careful when you go to the bank.

498
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
First of all, you have to be careful about the time.

499
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Avoid Sunday.

500
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
And then...

501
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Don't make a note.

502
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I can't make it there.

503
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Don't wear sandals.

504
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I can't run away.

505
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Make it warm.

506
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
That's right.

507
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
That's right.

508
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Why?

509
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
You can't wear it if it's cold.

510
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,000
If it's cold, I'll catch a cold.

511
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
I don't understand.

512
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
What?

513
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
You can't wear it if it's cold.

514
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
You can't wear it if it's cold.

515
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:32,000
See?

516
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
I'm telling you what you can't do.

517
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Listen.

518
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
You can't wear it if it's cold.

519
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:44,000
You can't wear it if you're sleepy.

520
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
You can't use it on your dogs.

521
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
You can wear it on your feet.

522
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,000
You can't eat sweets.

523
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
People will think I'm an idiot.

524
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,000
A long time ago, a boy scout even worked as the branch manager of the Western Japan branch.

525
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
The genius of games, Mr. Matsumoto.

526
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
What kind of fun game can you do with a 10-yen coin?

527
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Please give it a try.

528
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I don't have a 10-yen coin.

529
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Here you go.

530
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
How do you enjoy using this 10-yen coin?

531
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
That's right.

532
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Like this, right?

533
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
I'll go first, right?

534
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Go ahead.

535
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
I'll go first.

536
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Here you go.

537
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Three points.

538
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Here you go.

539
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Here you go.

540
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Oh, you lost the reverse point.

541
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
You lost the big reverse point.

542
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
I won.

543
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
You lost the big reverse point.

544
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
I lost the big reverse point.

545
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Here you go.

546
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
66 points.

547
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
What?

548
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
I didn't get anything.

549
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Okay, let's do it properly.

550
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Let's do it properly.

551
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Rock, paper, scissors.

552
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Look over there.

553
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:14,000
The one holding this is the winner.

554
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Let's use this to play.

555
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Okay, let's play.

556
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Okay?

557
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Front or back?

558
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Oh, okay.

559
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Front or back?

560
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Ready, set, go.

561
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Front.

562
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Front.

563
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,000
This is the same point.

564
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Ready, set, go.

565
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Back.

566
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:49,000
You're good.

567
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Okay, let's go.

568
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
What's funny?

569
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Let's go home.

570
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Can you do it?

571
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:10,000
This program was provided by the sponsor you are watching.

572
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:28,000
The fishing boat sank in the Noto Peninsula and six crew members are missing.
