1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:16,000
Hichihenge, the useless boy choreography

2
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
And now, the second male sounds- contribute from the junior gym

3
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:24,440
Finally comes the ending

4
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:27,440
How many of them are there?

5
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:32,440
Next time on Gaki no Tsukai, Chikitsuki! Chiyono Junior's transformation!

6
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:34,440
That was fast!

7
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:35,440
It was fast, right?

8
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:40,440
Well, my brother was like that, so I wanted to make him forget about it

9
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,440
But you're in 3rd place

10
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,440
Yes, I'm in 3rd place

11
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:48,440
It's strange, but I have a different potential

12
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:49,440
You're different from others

13
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,440
Yes

14
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:52,440
My dad is the type to worry

15
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:53,440
Oh really?

16
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,440
He doesn't sleep that much

17
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,440
He's not as good as his face

18
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:58,440
Let's ask him

19
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,440
Here's today's star

20
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:01,440
Thank you!

21
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,440
My brother

22
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,440
Hello

23
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,440
Please do your best

24
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,440
This is what hell is

25
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:08,440
Why is that?

26
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:10,440
It's the power of the two of us

27
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:13,440
It's like a kikishu cream

28
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,440
From now on?

29
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:15,440
Yes

30
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:16,440
A little while ago

31
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:20,440
I had a dream where my nails were peeled off the day before

32
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,440
I saw it

33
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,440
Why?

34
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:26,440
Well, it's natural that my nails were peeled off

35
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,440
3rd place! 3rd place!

36
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,440
Look at this

37
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:31,440
3rd place!

38
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,440
Why is your style a little good?

39
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:35,440
It can't be helped

40
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:37,440
It can't be helped!

41
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,440
Shut up

42
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:43,440
When I'm saying things like that, my brother laughs

43
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,440
It's peeled off

44
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,440
What are you going to do?

45
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,440
What should we do?

46
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,440
What should we do?

47
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,440
Is this what Yama-chan said?

48
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,440
What?

49
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,440
That's right

50
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:06,440
What does that mean?

51
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:09,440
Kyon is so cool

52
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,440
What is that?

53
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:14,440
Yama-chan always says that

54
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:19,440
When I was watching TV, my brother-in-law said that I became cool

55
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,440
But I became cool

56
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,440
Endo?

57
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,440
Saguro

58
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,440
He was looking at me

59
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,440
I don't know what to do

60
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,440
Is that so?

61
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,440
From various angles

62
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,440
It's not that Endo became cool, but Yama-chan became too uncool

63
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,440
Again, again

64
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,440
That's a lot of respect

65
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,440
You're joking again

66
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,440
I'm joking again

67
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,440
When I go there, my brother's style is not half bad

68
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,440
I've never measured my weight

69
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,440
It's almost the same as the Beijing Duck

70
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,440
It's thin

71
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,440
It's thin

72
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,440
I've earned a lot of money

73
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,440
Thank you

74
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,440
Why did you earn a lot of money?

75
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,440
Thank you

76
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:07,440
I can't help it

77
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,440
I can't help it

78
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:27,440
Did you get a place for the fireworks?

79
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:31,440
Why is the best place a bar?

80
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,440
Think about it

81
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:37,440
I'm a junior

82
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,440
Don't be so excited

83
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:43,440
Make me feel good

84
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:56,440
It's cold at night, so I'm telling you to come up

85
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:59,440
Think about it

86
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:03,440
Who is an idiot?

87
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,440
Who is an idiot?

88
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:17,440
Why did you bring me to a good soba restaurant?

89
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,440
Why didn't you ask for katsudon?

90
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,440
Think about it

91
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,440
I can't help it

92
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:25,440
I'm so excited

93
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,440
I can't help it

94
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,440
I can't help it

95
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,440
That was dangerous

96
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,440
I'm an idiot

97
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,440
Who is an idiot?

98
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,440
Seiji

99
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,440
Seiji is an idiot

100
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,440
Seiji is an idiot

101
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:53,440
The previous pattern is the opposite

102
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:57,440
Do you use HEPO?

103
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,440
I use HEPO

104
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:05,440
I have to stretch 1 meter

105
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,440
How tall are you?

106
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:09,440
I'm 181 cm

107
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,440
I didn't do anything

108
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,440
Did you eat cartamon?

109
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,440
I didn't eat anything

110
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,440
I ate a little more than expected

111
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,440
I think you ate cartamon

112
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:23,440
I'm a Kyoto person, so I eat cartamon

113
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,440
What are you talking about?

114
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,440
Are you a good person?

115
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:30,440
I'm a normal person

116
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:35,440
Thank you

117
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,440
Thank you

118
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:53,440
Excuse me

119
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:23,440
Thank you

120
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:53,440
I can't help it

121
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,440
I can't help it

122
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,440
Look at me

123
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:20,440
Don't invite me

124
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,440
I can't see

125
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:25,440
I see

126
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,440
It's completely different

127
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:31,440
I can't see

128
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:35,440
I can't see

129
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:40,440
I didn't know that Hotei was doing this

130
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:50,440
I think it would be interesting to find the roots of Hotei

131
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,440
Did you see Meisa?

132
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,440
I saw her

133
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:03,440
Did you see her character?

134
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,440
Yes

135
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:10,440
Do you want to tell Mizumoto?

136
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,440
I'll tell him next month

137
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,440
Did you see Meisa?

138
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,440
I saw her

139
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,440
Did you see her character?

140
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,440
Yes

141
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:23,440
Do you want to tell Mizumoto?

142
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,440
I'll tell him next month

143
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,440
Did you really see Meisa?

144
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:29,440
Yes

145
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,440
Did you see her character?

146
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,440
Yes

147
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,440
Did you see her character?

148
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:35,440
Yes

149
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,440
Do you want to tell Mizumoto?

150
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,440
Did you see Meisa?

151
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:43,440
Yes

152
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,440
Did you see her character?

153
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,440
You were missing, weren't you?

154
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,440
Do you want to tell Hikisa?

155
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,440
Do you want to tell Hikisa?

156
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,440
I'm going to tell her

157
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,440
Who do you want to tell?

158
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,440
Hikisa

159
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,440
Hikisa is not in the game now

160
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,440
Hikisa

161
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:08,440
Hikisa is not in the game now

162
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:11,440
I found a new character

163
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,440
I found a new character

164
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,440
It's nice

165
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,440
It's a new character

166
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:20,440
Who is laughing?

167
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:23,440
I can't help it

168
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,440
He is a fool

169
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,440
His necktie is too short

170
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:38,440
What should I do?

171
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:52,440
Who is this?

172
00:09:52,440 --> 00:10:03,440
Who is this?

173
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:12,440
Who is this?

174
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:16,440
Who is this?

175
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:19,440
Sorry

176
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,440
Let's go

177
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:27,440
It was dangerous

178
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,440
Sanma appears here

179
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,440
It's true

180
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,440
It was a little similar

181
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:39,440
But I really thought who this was

182
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,440
Who is this?

183
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,440
I don't know

184
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,440
That's right

185
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:50,440
He is the worst

186
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:53,440
What should I do?

187
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,440
Did you play DS?

188
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,440
Is it on sale?

189
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,440
Is it on sale?

190
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,440
Is it on sale?

191
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,440
Is it on sale?

192
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:07,440
I played it on the guide

193
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:18,440
Yu-chan, where are you?

194
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:22,440
I came to the capital of flowers

195
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,440
I came to the capital of flowers

196
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,440
I came to the capital of flowers

197
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,440
Recently, the vegetables

198
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:33,440
Shut up

199
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,440
I don't know what to do

200
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,440
I'm sick of money

201
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,440
Heipo-chan, can I have some coffee?

202
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:46,440
Shut up

203
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,440
No matter how much I beg

204
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:53,440
I'm not a woman

205
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,440
My daughter is

206
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:01,440
I'm not a woman

207
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,440
If you ask me

208
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:10,440
I'm imitating myself

209
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,440
Recently, the vegetables

210
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:16,440
Shut up

211
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:32,440
I can't see anything from this conference room

212
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:39,440
Yu-chan

213
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:46,440
I like Ryuji

214
00:12:46,440 --> 00:13:11,440
I like Ryuji

215
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:17,440
Don't laugh

216
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:38,440
It's that

217
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:44,520
I am crazy about those two, right?

218
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:55,560
I want to speak Japanese with someone.

219
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:01,500
I am crazy about those two,right?

220
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:06,960
You say that a lot, right?

221
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:11,960
What? What? What?

222
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,960
What?

223
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,960
That was dangerous.

224
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,960
I lost.

225
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,960
You lost.

226
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:44,960
I lost.

227
00:14:44,960 --> 00:15:09,960
Number 23, who is it?

228
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:15,960
There was an accident on the bike.

229
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,960
Yeah.

230
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:22,960
When the accident happened, it hurt.

231
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:26,960
Yeah.

232
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:30,960
I don't want to see that pain again.

233
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:36,960
Yeah.

234
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:39,960
It was really hard.

235
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:43,960
Yeah.

236
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:46,960
I don't want to see that pain again.

237
00:15:46,960 --> 00:16:11,960
I don't want to see that pain again.

238
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:12,960
Let's count.

239
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:19,960
Let's count.

240
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:20,960
Here it is.

241
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:21,960
How much is it?

242
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:22,960
I'll announce it.

243
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,960
It's 26,000 yen.

244
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:25,960
26,000 yen.

245
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:26,960
Number 11.

246
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:27,960
It's Miyasako.

247
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,960
It's Miyasako.

248
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:34,960
Thank you.

249
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:40,960
I should have done it earlier.

250
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,960
Next is you.

251
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,960
Next is you.

252
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:49,960
I didn't do it today, but I made a lot of money.

253
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:53,960
I didn't do it today.

254
00:16:53,960 --> 00:17:01,960
Ladies and gentlemen.

255
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:02,960
Good evening.

256
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:03,960
Good evening.

257
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:04,960
I'll do my best.

258
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:05,960
Good evening.

259
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:08,960
I'll do my best.

260
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:13,960
I'm Hama, in charge of the comments.

261
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:21,960
I'm Machan, in charge of the jokes.

262
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:24,960
You're not stupid.

263
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:25,960
Well, well, well.

264
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:26,960
I can't say anything good.

265
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:27,960
Well, yeah.

266
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:31,960
Yesterday, Mr. Takatanosu of Japanet.

267
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:32,960
I've been saying this for a long time.

268
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:33,960
I've been saying this for a long time.

269
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:36,960
This is too expensive.

270
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,960
I'm getting more expensive.

271
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:39,960
I've been saying this for a long time.

272
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:40,960
I've been saying this for a long time.

273
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,960
I haven't seen it recently.

274
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,960
I was sleeping while watching TV yesterday.

275
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,960
A man came out and said,

276
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:53,960
Cool body.

277
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:54,960
How is it?

278
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,960
This cool body.

279
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:00,960
He said,

280
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:05,960
This cool body.

281
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:06,960
I want to sell it.

282
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:07,960
I want to sell it.

283
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:08,960
What kind of product is it?

284
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:09,960
Well, well, well.

285
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:10,960
What is it?

286
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:11,960
Well, well, well.

287
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:12,960
Metallic.

288
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:13,960
This metallic.

289
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:14,960
How is it?

290
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,960
This cool body.

291
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:17,960
He said,

292
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,960
This cool body.

293
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:20,960
Well, well, well.

294
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:21,960
Well, well, well.

295
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:24,960
You know, the bees.

296
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,960
There's a health food.

297
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:27,960
Royal jelly.

298
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:28,960
Royal jelly.

299
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:29,960
Mr. Anosu does it again.

300
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:30,960
Well, well, well.

301
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:31,960
This royal jelly.

302
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:32,960
This color.

303
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:33,960
Royal.

304
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:38,960
I don't know what to say.

305
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,960
It's not that effective.

306
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:44,960
Why is it so easy to drink?

307
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,960
You can drink it if you have water.

308
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:48,960
Well, well, well.

309
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,960
I'll forgive you.

310
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:51,960
It's okay.

311
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,960
I can't sleep.

312
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:54,960
In the middle of the night?

313
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:55,960
It's in the middle of the night.

314
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:59,960
I think I know what I was saying.

315
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,960
I was saying Vega Vega.

316
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:04,960
I started to say Vega.

317
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:05,960
Really?

318
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:06,960
Yes.

319
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,960
But I said Sonino.

320
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:15,960
One more time.

321
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:19,960
Mr. Anosu, you recently bought a new car.

322
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:24,960
You, too.

323
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,960
I don't want to buy a new car.

324
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,960
What do you mean you don't want to buy a new car?

325
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,960
You're the same age as me.

326
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:36,960
If I'm driving, the parts will fall off.

327
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,960
I don't want to buy a new car because it's not rusty.

328
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,960
I've been driving a car for six years.

329
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,960
I've been driving for about six years.

330
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:46,960
That's not true.

331
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,960
You're the one who keeps changing.

332
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:53,960
Why are you angry with me?

333
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:54,960
It's been a long time since I've driven a car.

334
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,960
You keep changing.

335
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,960
You're going to buy a new car again, aren't you?

336
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,960
You're going to buy a new car again, aren't you?

337
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:04,960
I have a new car.

338
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,960
That's not true.

339
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:10,960
You're too smart and stupid.

340
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:11,960
What?

341
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:12,960
You're going to buy a new car?

342
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:13,960
You're going to buy a new car?

343
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:16,960
There's a lot of meaningless functions.

344
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,960
I told you before.

345
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,960
There are a lot of buttons that I don't understand.

346
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:30,960
When I press the button, even if the speed is more than 40 km per hour, the speed is too high.

347
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,960
I don't understand the meaning of the button.

348
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:38,960
When I was driving at night, the yellow light was shining.

349
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,960
I was wondering what it was.

350
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:49,960
I looked it up and found that the airbag was working fine.

351
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:53,960
It's working fine today.

352
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:56,960
I'm attracted to the wrong time.

353
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,960
The opposite.

354
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:03,960
It's shining again today.

355
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,960
It's strange.

356
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,960
Why is there such a function?

357
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:08,960
Didn't you know that it was working fine?

358
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:09,960
I don't know.

359
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:10,960
How did you buy it?

360
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,960
Did you buy it without looking at it?

361
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,960
I bought it without looking at it.

362
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,960
Did you hear that?

363
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:23,960
I bought it without looking at it.

364
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,960
What is it?

365
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:29,960
You are a man.

366
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:33,960
Cool body.

367
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,960
What are you going to do with it?

368
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:38,960
I sell it.

369
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:43,960
I sell it and run away.

370
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:47,960
I buy shoes.

371
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:54,960
I buy it like this.

372
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:55,960
I will buy that.

373
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:58,960
I will follow you all the time.

374
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:05,960
If you give a car as a gift on TV, you will be given a big key.

375
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:09,960
What kind of car is the car with that key?

376
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:13,960
That is not a real key.

377
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:17,960
That is a fake key.

378
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:21,960
I know that.

379
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:26,960
Really.

380
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,960
What is that face?

381
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:32,960
Stop that face.

382
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,960
That is made of styrofoam.

383
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:41,960
Even if a real key is given, it is difficult to distinguish it on TV.

384
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:48,960
So I made a big key and got a car.

385
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:53,960
Really.

386
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:56,960
Everyone knows that.

387
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,960
Stop that face.

388
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,960
I am angry.

389
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:07,960
I make a big key.

390
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:12,960
I don't have money.

391
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,960
But I make a real key.

392
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:19,960
Stop that face.

393
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:22,960
What?

394
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:26,960
Stop that face.

395
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:32,960
I completely forgot about your job.
