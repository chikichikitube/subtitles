1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,420
I'm not a kid.

2
00:00:01,420 --> 00:00:03,420
O-Haka is dangerous!

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:06,920
Super Mile

4
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:12,420
I'm not a kid.

5
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:16,340
Chiki Chiki Hettare Yamazaki One-man Project, Part 3

6
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:18,340
A behind-the-scenes story on the night of O-Haka

7
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:20,340
and a great strategy to test the time.

8
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:25,540
I'm in O-Haka.

9
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:27,540
It's on the signboard.

10
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:30,540
This is Yamazaki's One-man Project, Part 3.

11
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:32,540
I'm sure he'll show us something cool today.

12
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:34,540
Yeah, even if you say that.

13
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:37,540
Until now, it was a little different meaning.

14
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:40,540
This time, it's a matter of temperament.

15
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,540
It's a test of courage.

16
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:45,540
So, the star of the night is Yamazaki.

17
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:47,540
Here you go.

18
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:51,540
Your voice is so low.

19
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:56,540
Who's this girl next to you?

20
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:58,540
You're in trouble.

21
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:02,540
Of course, it's pitch black.

22
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:04,540
Look at this.

23
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:06,540
You can't see anything, can you?

24
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:08,540
There's nothing black.

25
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:10,540
If you look at it all the time, it's a signboard.

26
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:12,540
It's on the road.

27
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:14,540
The woman in the back is an old lady.

28
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:16,540
What are you talking about?

29
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:22,540
You know what?

30
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:24,540
At the very end, there's a card.

31
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:26,540
Take the card and come back.

32
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:28,540
I can't run away on the way.

33
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:30,540
You can't run away.

34
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:32,540
I can't run away, but I can't come back.

35
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:34,540
If you run away, don't come here.

36
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:36,540
Where are you going?

37
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:38,540
I don't think there's a seat in Yoshimoto anymore.

38
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:40,540
Good luck.

39
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:54,540
Are you waiting here?

40
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:56,540
I'm scared.

41
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:58,540
I can hear the sound.

42
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:00,540
I'm scared.

43
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:10,540
It looks bright.

44
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:12,540
The infrared is amazing.

45
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:18,540
A dog is barking.

46
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:20,540
A dog is barking.

47
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:28,540
Is this a real dog?

48
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:36,540
I was surprised.

49
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:38,540
A dog is barking.

50
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:48,540
The dog's face was very funny.

51
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:52,540
Why are you so surprised?

52
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:00,540
The dog's face is scary.

53
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:06,540
I'm scared.

54
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:08,540
I don't know why the dog is barking.

55
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:10,540
This is a dog.

56
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:12,540
What are you talking about?

57
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:14,540
I'm confused.

58
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:16,540
Who are you talking to?

59
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:18,540
I'm confused.

60
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:20,540
I'm confused.

61
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:22,540
I'm confused.

62
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:24,540
You're not talking to me.

63
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:26,540
What?

64
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,540
You're not talking to me.

65
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:30,540
I'm confused.

66
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:32,540
You're not talking to me.

67
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:34,540
Come here.

68
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:44,540
I'm confused.

69
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:46,540
You're not talking to me.

70
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:52,540
Wait a minute.

71
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:54,540
Wait a minute.

72
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:56,540
Wait a minute.

73
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:58,540
Wait a minute.

74
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:00,540
Wait a minute.

75
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,540
Wait a minute.

76
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:04,540
Wait a minute.

77
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:06,540
Wait a minute.

78
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:08,540
Wait a minute.

79
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,540
Yamazaki.

80
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:12,540
Yamazaki?

81
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:14,540
Why are you naked?

82
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:16,540
Are you my partner?

83
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:18,540
I'm looking down.

84
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:20,540
Yamazaki?

85
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:22,540
I don't have a shoe.

86
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:24,540
Yamazaki.

87
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:26,540
Yamazaki?

88
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:28,540
I was so scared.

89
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:30,540
Yamazaki.

90
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:32,540
There were five of us.

91
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:34,540
A ghost?

92
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:36,540
It's a yakuza.

93
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:38,540
It's a yakuza.

94
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:40,540
It's a yakuza.

95
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:42,540
It's a yakuza.

96
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:44,540
It's a yakuza.

97
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:46,540
It's a yakuza.

98
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:48,540
It's a yakuza.

99
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,540
It's a yakuza.

100
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,540
It's a yakuza.

101
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:54,540
I have to say.

102
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:56,540
You look like a yakuza?

103
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:58,540
Yamazaki?

104
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:00,540
I don't remember.

105
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:02,540
I'm not yakuza.

106
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:04,540
They called me.

107
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:06,540
Yamazaki.

108
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:08,540
A lot of trouble.

109
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:10,540
It's hard to say.

110
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:12,540
Yamazaki.

111
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:14,540
I don't know.

112
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:16,540
Maybe.

113
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:18,540
Chidori.

114
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:20,540
I'm sorry.

115
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:21,980
I can't.

116
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:23,980
No, it's not like that.

117
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:25,980
It's not like that at all.

118
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:41,980
I don't know.

119
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:46,980
There's not a lot of people today, right?

120
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:49,980
There's not a lot of people, and it's the same age as usual.

121
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:51,980
That's right.

122
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:53,980
Well, it's fine.

123
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,980
I'm sorry, but I'm a little confused.

124
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:56,980
Why?

125
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:59,980
The engine is not doing well, so please take a look.

126
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:08,980
No, I'm not.

127
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:11,980
Wait a minute.

128
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:14,980
Is this fashionable?

129
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:16,980
That's right.

130
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:18,980
It's fashionable.

131
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:22,980
I heard you're connected to fashionable talent.

132
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:25,980
I heard you're raising the price a lot.

133
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:27,980
It's not like that.

134
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:29,980
I don't think so.

135
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:31,980
That's fine.

136
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:33,980
But I can't play with cars.

137
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:35,980
That's right.

138
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:38,980
There's a story about the price of high-speed cars.

139
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:39,980
Really?

140
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:41,980
It's 600 yen now, right?

141
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:42,980
I'll make it 700 yen.

142
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:44,980
Even if you make it 700 yen, you have to ride it.

143
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:48,980
I think so, but high-speed cars should be made directly.

144
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:52,980
You're a sushi restaurant, aren't you?

145
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:54,980
You should definitely do that.

146
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:55,980
But I think a lot.

147
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:58,980
An old man at the window asked me for money directly.

148
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:00,980
I'm free, so I'll give you 2,000 yen.

149
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:01,980
2,000 yen.

150
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:03,980
What?

151
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:06,980
He's not alive.

152
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:09,980
I'll do that.

153
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:11,980
You may be like that.

154
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:12,980
That's not true.

155
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:15,980
That's why the price is written on the bottom.

156
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:16,980
It's going to change.

157
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:17,980
Of course.

158
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:20,980
It's impossible for an old man to ask for money directly.

159
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:21,980
It's an old man's good price.

160
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:23,980
That's right.

161
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:25,980
You shouldn't do that.

162
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:28,980
Next time, if an old man sees a person,

163
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:30,980
I'll give you 5,000 yen.

164
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:33,980
That's not good.

165
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:35,980
I'll give it to you before the price goes up.

166
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:36,980
Of course.

167
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:38,980
It's okay now.

168
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:39,980
That's fine.

169
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:42,980
If you don't do that, I'll give you a lot of money.

170
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:45,980
I've been to Harajuku once.

171
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:47,980
I didn't know.

172
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:49,980
I didn't know.

173
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:52,980
You've been there, haven't you?

174
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:54,980
You've been there, haven't you?

175
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:55,980
You've been there, haven't you?

176
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:58,980
There was a red box.

177
00:07:58,980 --> 00:07:59,980
I didn't know.

178
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:00,980
Wait a minute.

179
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:01,980
In the past,

180
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:04,980
I was working on a dirty Marmaron.

181
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:08,980
I was making a new one behind it.

182
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:09,980
When I came up,

183
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:11,980
there was an unmanned box.

184
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:13,980
I looked at it, and I had money.

185
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:14,980
But there was no old man.

186
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:15,980
So I thought,

187
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:19,980
I don't need it today.

188
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:20,980
And then,

189
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:24,980
there was an old man standing right next to me.

190
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:25,980
He was screaming,

191
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:29,980
but I was screaming, too.

192
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:32,980
I was screaming at the same time as the old man.

193
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:34,980
I just left.

194
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:37,980
I don't need it today.

195
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:39,980
I don't need it today.

196
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:40,980
That's not it.

197
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:43,980
I've been on the highway many times.

198
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:44,980
I've been photographed many times,

199
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:46,980
but I've never been sent there.

200
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:48,980
All of them aren't in the video.

201
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:49,980
Just the flash.

202
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:51,980
They react to it at high speed.

203
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:53,980
That's right.

204
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:55,980
I was angry.

205
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,980
I was photographed once.

206
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:59,980
It was like my friend's friend.

207
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:00,980
I was angry,

208
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:01,980
I got off the car,

209
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:03,980
and I had a will.

210
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:04,980
I had a will,

211
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:05,980
and I threw the car.

212
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:07,980
When I got off the car,

213
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:08,980
I reacted with that will,

214
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:11,980
and I threw the umbrella.

215
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:14,980
I was sent there many times.

216
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:15,980
You were photographed like this?

217
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:16,980
Yes.

218
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:17,980
The police called me,

219
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:18,980
and I said,

220
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:19,980
I want to see this.

221
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:21,980
And I threw it.

222
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:22,980
That's not true.

223
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:24,980
You're lying.

224
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:26,980
It's true.

225
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:28,980
That's not true.

226
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:30,980
I've never lied.

227
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:32,980
You're lying.

228
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:35,980
But you can take a good picture.

229
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:37,980
That's not true.

230
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:43,980
Who thought of taking a picture?

231
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:45,980
You haven't been photographed once?

232
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:47,980
I've been in a taxi once.

233
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:48,980
In the taxi,

234
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:49,980
an old man was in the taxi,

235
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:51,980
and the old man was very happy.

236
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:54,980
Is that so?

237
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:55,980
He was very happy.

238
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:57,980
That's not true.

239
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:59,980
But it was very difficult.

240
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:03,980
He was very happy.

241
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:08,980
Then the old man suddenly...

242
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:09,980
The old man was photographed,

243
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:10,980
and he was wearing blue.

244
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:11,980
He was wearing blue.

245
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:16,980
Then he started to talk a lot.

246
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:20,980
That's strange.

247
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:22,980
An old man who does business,

248
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:24,980
once he does that,

249
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:25,980
he can't rest.

250
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:27,980
That's right.

251
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:29,980
I often say that,

252
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:32,980
but that's written on the side of the car.

253
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:36,980
It's written on the side.

254
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:38,980
It's a sign.

255
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:39,980
Yes, yes.

256
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:40,980
It's quiet.

257
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:44,980
It's like this, right?

258
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:47,980
Oh, it's your mother.

259
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:48,980
It's true.

260
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:49,980
Right?

261
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:55,980
I love you.

262
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:59,980
I'm very popular with my mother.

263
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:00,980
Is that so?

264
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:03,980
I called her once before.

265
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:04,980
You called a woman.

266
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:05,980
Your mother.

267
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:06,980
My mother came,

268
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:07,980
and she said,

269
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:09,980
are you waiting for me?

270
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:12,980
She found out.

271
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:14,980
I heard it from my daughter.

272
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:16,980
Oh, I'm sorry.

273
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,980
I'll call you again.

274
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:20,980
Wait a minute.

275
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,980
What?

276
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:25,980
If you don't invite only your daughter,

277
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:30,980
invite your mother too.

278
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:31,980
It's like that.

279
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:32,980
No, no.

280
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:35,980
Are you serious?

281
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:37,980
I'm a little angry.

282
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:40,980
Did you make that face?

283
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:41,980
Yes.

284
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:48,980
It's true.

285
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:53,980
It's funny.

286
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:56,980
It's like that.

287
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:58,980
It's not good for young people.

288
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:01,980
What are you talking about?

289
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:02,980
It's true.

290
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:10,980
You can't rest.

291
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:13,980
What do you mean?

292
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:15,980
What do you mean?

293
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:18,980
You're not working.

294
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:20,980
That's not true.

295
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:21,980
I can't sleep.

296
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:22,980
I can't sleep.

297
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:24,980
I can't sleep because of that.

298
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:26,980
I can't sleep.

299
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:27,980
After I finished it,

300
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:30,980
I asked how many people had done it.

301
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:31,980
No, I didn't do that much.

302
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:34,980
I asked how many people had done it.

303
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:36,980
No, if I did it,

304
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:39,980
30 people would have done it.

305
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:44,980
Is that okay?

306
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:47,980
I thought it was okay.

307
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:51,980
I thought it was okay.

308
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:54,980
I can't say this.

309
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:59,980
It's a lie.

310
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:02,980
Girls are doing it these days.

311
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:03,980
It's amazing.

312
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:04,980
It's amazing, isn't it?

313
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:07,980
What's your mother like?

314
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:08,980
When I was young,

315
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:10,980
I was told that.

316
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:12,980
Your mother was beautiful when she was young.

317
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:17,980
Thank you.

318
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:19,980
I'm going crazy.

319
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:28,980
I'm going crazy.

320
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:29,980
A long time ago,

321
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:30,980
Mr. Matsumoto said,

322
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:34,980
The person who made the phone is a bell.

323
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:35,980
When I heard that,

324
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:36,980
I was convinced.

325
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:37,980
At the same time,

326
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:38,980
I had a question.

327
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:39,980
Is the person who made the chuck

328
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:41,980
Mr. Chuck?

329
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:43,980
Or is it Mr. Fasner?

330
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:45,980
I want to ask this.

331
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:46,980
But this is true.

332
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:49,980
Everyone is like that.

333
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:51,980
The name of the person who made it is all

334
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:53,980
Maruyama Vaccine Maruyama.

335
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:54,980
I know that.

336
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:56,980
Everyone knows that.

337
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:57,980
It's not like that.

338
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:00,980
Tell me what's written in the newspaper.

339
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:03,980
You guys are really stupid.

340
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:06,980
Chuck E.H. Fasner.

341
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:11,980
What?

342
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:13,980
Don't say E.H.

343
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:15,980
The minister has a lot of names.

344
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:19,980
It's made up of three or four names.

345
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:21,980
That's why there's a person

346
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:23,980
called Chuck Fasner.

347
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:24,980
That's why you're using both.

348
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:28,980
I'm using both.

349
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:29,980
That's all.

350
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:31,980
It doesn't matter if it's a little difficult story.

351
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:33,980
It's a very simple story.

352
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:34,980
Is that so?

353
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:35,980
Yes.

354
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:36,980
Everyone says that.

355
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:38,980
I don't mean everyone.

356
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:41,980
I made a sandwich.

357
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:42,980
What?

358
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:45,980
That's just what everyone knows.

359
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:47,980
Everyone...

360
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:50,980
You've never said anything that everyone doesn't understand.

361
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:51,980
Why?

362
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:54,980
No one believes in Chuck and Fasner.

363
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:57,980
Check it out.

364
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:58,980
I'll check it out.

365
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:01,980
It's safe.

366
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:04,980
What are you talking about?

367
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:07,980
What?

368
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:10,980
That's right.

369
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:12,980
What's that white thing on the back of the bike

370
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:16,980
that the police officer is riding?

371
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:18,980
You're the one who put the ticket in.

372
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:20,980
What?

373
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:21,980
You put the ticket in, right?

374
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:25,980
You don't know anything about the police or the yakuza.

375
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:28,980
What are you learning?

376
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:31,980
I see.

377
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:34,980
I wonder if there was something like that before.

378
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:37,980
The man on the Shinkansen has a dash case.

379
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,980
Don't tell me what's in there.

380
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:44,980
That's the Shinkansen's way of riding.

381
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:45,980
Hand-pulling?

382
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:51,980
Hand-pulling.

383
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:54,980
Remember it before you ride it.

384
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:55,980
I'm not scared.

385
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:57,980
If you drive while looking at it.

386
00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:02,980
It's like you're holding your fingers together.

387
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:04,980
Next question.

388
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:13,980
Is it warm or cold if you turn on the cooler and the stove at the same time in the same room?

389
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:18,980
It feels good.

390
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:20,980
It feels really good.

391
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,980
Everyone doesn't believe me.

392
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:25,980
It's raining.

393
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:30,980
It's raining here. It's raining here. It's not raining here.

394
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:33,980
Have you ever stood on the slope of that?

395
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:34,980
Have you ever stood on it?

396
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:41,980
I've never stood on it, but I've seen it.

397
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:43,980
There is.

398
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:44,980
But I've never stood on the slope.

399
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:47,980
I've seen it.

400
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:54,980
That means what I'm saying is so unusual.

401
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:58,980
I've never seen it. I'm sorry.

402
00:16:58,980 --> 00:16:59,980
No, no, no.

403
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:00,980
I'm more amazing.

404
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:01,980
Really?

405
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:03,980
Let me hear that. Let me hear that.

406
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:07,980
That's why it's not wet at all here.

407
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:11,980
I'm telling the truth.

408
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:13,980
I can't stand it anymore.

409
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:15,980
If that's the case.

410
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:16,980
I'm telling the truth.

411
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:18,980
I can't make up a story like this.

412
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:20,980
No, no, no.

413
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:21,980
I'm telling the truth.

414
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:22,980
Yes, yes, yes.

415
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:24,980
It's really wet here. It's not wet at all here.

416
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:25,980
I'm glad. I'm glad.

417
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:29,980
No, no, no, no.

418
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:33,980
It's been like this all the time.

419
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:35,980
No, no, no.

420
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:37,980
It's been like this all the time.

421
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:39,980
Go to the side.

422
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:43,980
It's funny. It's only wet here.

423
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:48,980
It's been like this all the time, but you should go to the side.

424
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:50,980
What's that? Were you walking alone?

425
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:51,980
Yes, I was walking alone.

426
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:52,980
No one was watching you?

427
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:53,980
No one was watching me.

428
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:56,980
There's no witness, is there?

429
00:17:56,980 --> 00:18:00,980
I got it.

430
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:03,980
I'm hungry.

431
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:08,980
I have a lot of stories that you don't believe.

432
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:09,980
Don't say that.

433
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:14,980
I've known it for a long time.

434
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:18,980
One day, when I was in elementary school,

435
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:21,980
I came home from school.

436
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:23,980
What's that?

437
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:26,980
You're making such a scary face.

438
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:27,980
What should I do?

439
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:29,980
This is a real story. This is a real story.

440
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:30,980
I came home from school.

441
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:35,980
This is a real story.

442
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:37,980
I got it. I got it.

443
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:39,980
I'm especially curious about this.

444
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:40,980
Yes, yes, yes.

445
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:41,980
A man is a king.

446
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:44,980
That's enough.

447
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:46,980
Stop it.

448
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:47,980
As long as you're alive.

449
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:49,980
Stop it.

450
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:52,980
When I came home, there was a table.

451
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:58,980
There was an animal I've never seen before.

452
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:01,980
Goodbye. See you again.

453
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:02,980
This is a real story.

454
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:04,980
No, it's a lie.

455
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:06,980
An animal I've never seen before.

456
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:10,980
What kind of shape was it? What kind of outfit was it?

457
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:13,980
Stop it.

458
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:15,980
I don't care about your face.

459
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:18,980
It's brown and long.

460
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:20,980
What do you mean it's long?

461
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:22,980
It's long like this.

462
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:25,980
That's not true.

463
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:26,980
It's not true.

464
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:29,980
It's not long.

465
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:31,980
It's short.

466
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:32,980
It's two legs.

467
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:36,980
You're a fool.

468
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:37,980
It's two legs.

469
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:39,980
It's like this.

470
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:42,980
You're making it more and more.

471
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:44,980
It's a real story. It's a real story.

472
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:46,980
It's getting more and more.

473
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:48,980
There was a pot and I put it in the pot.

474
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:53,980
Hey, hey.

475
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:55,980
That's not true.

476
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:58,980
You said, oh, and you looked at me.

477
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:00,980
Oh.

478
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:02,980
I didn't do that.

479
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:05,980
That's not true.

480
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:08,980
Why are you saying that?

481
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:11,980
It's like a fly.

482
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:13,980
Tell me quickly.

483
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,980
I'm telling you it's going up!

484
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:17,980
And then the transparent wings go like this

485
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:18,980
It's transparent!

486
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:19,980
It's like a fly

487
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:21,980
And then it goes like this

488
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:22,980
You can't take it off

489
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:24,980
You can't take it off

490
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:25,980
And then the tail

491
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:26,980
Ah, the tail

492
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:29,980
The tail goes like this

493
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:31,980
What's that?

494
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:33,980
It's like Fujiyama

495
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:36,980
Good morning

496
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:37,980
What's that?

497
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:41,980
It goes like this

498
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:50,980
I saw that when I was in elementary school

499
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:51,980
You're so noisy

500
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:59,980
I'm going to make a joke out of this

501
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:00,980
It's you

502
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:04,980
It's true

503
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:07,980
It's true

504
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:09,980
I broke it

505
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:11,980
What happened to it?

506
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:13,980
It went like this

507
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:15,980
And the other one went like this too

508
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:20,980
No matter what you do, you hit the set

509
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:23,980
The other one went like this too

510
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:25,980
They're both like this

511
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:27,980
You can't do that

512
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:31,980
They're like this

513
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:34,980
They're glaring at each other

514
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:36,980
They don't even look at each other

515
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:38,980
They don't even look at each other

516
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:40,980
They stay like this

517
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:41,980
And then the other one went like this

518
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:42,980
So you're really doing it?

519
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:44,980
You're really doing that?

520
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:46,980
No

521
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:47,980
What's that?

522
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:50,980
I'm hot

523
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:51,980
You're hot? That's scary

524
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:53,980
You shouldn't look in the hot water

525
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:54,980
You shouldn't look away

526
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,980
If you look at me, you're going to get hit!

527
00:21:57,980 --> 00:21:59,980
I'm looking at you!

528
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:01,980
Look over there.

529
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:03,980
What is this?

530
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:05,980
I can't lose either!

531
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:09,980
Did you do it? Did you do it?

532
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:11,980
I'm going to stare at you forever.

533
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:15,980
Are you okay?

534
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:16,980
Yes!

535
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:18,980
I can't do it anymore!

536
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:19,980
It's that time!

537
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:20,980
It's that time!

538
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:24,980
Good morning!
