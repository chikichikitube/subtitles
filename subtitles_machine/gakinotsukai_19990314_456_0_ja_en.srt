1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Gaki no Tsukai Meibutsu Kichihenge

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
In the middle of a meeting, he disguises himself and makes everyone laugh.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
It's simple, but it's a project that requires a lot of sense of humor.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Until now, Yamazaki, Kokoriko, and a number of staff have challenged him.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
He has shown off his talent.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
And tonight, he has come back for the first time in a year.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Now, who will challenge him?

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
In the first episode of Gaki no Tsukai Meibutsu, Chikishiki, Ameawari,

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
and Hotohara Shihengne!

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Hotohara Shihengne?

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
That's right.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I understand that he wants to challenge Ameawari,

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
but he's in the wrong spot.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Thank you, Ameawari!

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Thank you!

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
He's from Hatsumiyasako.

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
You're finally here.

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
You're finally here.

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
The Hotohara boom.

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
You're finally here.

21
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
In the past 12 episodes, the one with the best performance was Kokoriko Tanaka.

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Really?

23
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
The winner was Takasu, a high school football player.

24
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Takasu won?

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
7,000 yen.

26
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
How much do you want to win?

27
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
About 50,000 yen.

28
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Really?

29
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Of course.

30
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
That's right.

31
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
He said I have a bad complexion.

32
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Did he say that?

33
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
He said that.

34
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
He said I have a bad complexion.

35
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
He said I have a bad complexion.

36
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
This program is brought to you by the following sponsors.

37
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
What should we do?

38
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
What should we do?

39
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Don't you think this is interesting?

40
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
What?

41
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
It's only now.

42
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Yeah.

43
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
We're selling character merch.

44
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Everyone's selling a lot of stuff now.

45
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Character merch.

46
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
But there's no way we can save him.

47
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
We're selling merch.

48
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I think Saito-san's calendar t-shirt will sell well.

49
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I think my back is going to break.

50
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
What should we do?

51
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
What should we do?

52
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,000
We played against Ujiwara and Kimoto the other day.

53
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
That's right.

54
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
We have a little more time.

55
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
What should we do?

56
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
You can tell us what you want to do.

57
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
What I want to do...

58
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I don't know if I can do that.

59
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Yeah.

60
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Let's have dinner when it's cold.

61
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Yeah.

62
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
But it's going to cost a lot of money.

63
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Really?

64
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Yeah.

65
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
It's going to be amazing.

66
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:47,000
If you get injured, you'll have to go see a doctor.

67
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I can't see the concept.

68
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I can't see the concept.

69
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
You were looking for a table, weren't you?

70
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Oh, that's how it is.

71
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
It fits your head.

72
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
It would have been fun if you had a piece of bread on your head.

73
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Matsumoto-san's head is spinning.

74
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Today, we're going to talk about the welfare issue.

75
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:07,000
How about you, Matsumoto-san?

76
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:20,000
How about you, Matsumoto-san?

77
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
It's cute.

78
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Which one is it?

79
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:39,000
It's stretching.

80
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
It's pulling.

81
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
It's so sad.

82
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Look at Miyasako's face.

83
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
What should we do?

84
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Is this okay?

85
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
There's something.

86
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
There's something.

87
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:28,000
It's cute.

88
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:48,000
It's cute.

89
00:05:48,000 --> 00:06:05,000
It's funny.

90
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:12,000
It looks like you.

91
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I want to do it with Korakuen.

92
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Where is it?

93
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Where is it?

94
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Where is it?

95
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Midorigame was a little bad.

96
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Midorigame was a little funny.

97
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
It was a good one.

98
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
But Heipo was bad.

99
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:23,000
It was a bad one.

100
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Who is it?

101
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I'm going to kill you.

102
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I won't forgive you.

103
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Who is it?

104
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Is it you?

105
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
It's you, isn't it?

106
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Is it you?

107
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Is it you?

108
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Huh?

109
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Do you want to die?

110
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Is it you?

111
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
You want it?

112
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
You want it?

113
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Let's go!

114
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
That was close.

115
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
That was close.

116
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
That was close.

117
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
That was close.

118
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
That was close.

119
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
That was close.

120
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I'm not good at acting.

121
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I've been acting for 11 years now.

122
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
It's Hakusoto.

123
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
It's Hakusoto.

124
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
It's Hakusoto.

125
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
That was close.

126
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
It's Hakusoto.

127
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
It's Hakusoto.

128
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
It's Hakusoto.

129
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
It's Hakusoto.

130
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I don't want to talk about it.

131
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I'm sorry.

132
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Don't say that.

133
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
It's okay.

134
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
It's okay.

135
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:39,000
It's okay.

136
00:09:39,000 --> 00:10:03,000
What?

137
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
You guys are strong.

138
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I'm sorry.

139
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
It's all over.

140
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
It's all over.

141
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
It's 19,000 yen.

142
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
19,000 yen?

143
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
So it's 3rd.

144
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Eh?

145
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
4th place?

146
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Eh?

147
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Endo dropped.

148
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Yes.

149
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Really?

150
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Yes.

151
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
It's 4th place.

152
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Thank you.

153
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Thank you.

154
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Miyasako is very depressed.

155
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Why?

156
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Your talent is sad.

157
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Let's think about it.

158
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I'm doing it.

159
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Miyasako?

160
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Yes.

161
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Miyasako should do it someday.

162
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I can't sleep for a week if I listen to this.

163
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
That's right.

164
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Really?

165
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
You couldn't sleep at all yesterday, right?

166
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Yes.

167
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
It's true.

168
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
You were awake for 20 minutes.

169
00:10:50,000 --> 00:11:03,000
It's not funny at all.

170
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:31,000
It's not funny at all.

171
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Actually, thank you for saying wow.

172
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:40,000
But we have a problem.

173
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
No, no.

174
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:46,000
If it doesn't end soon, we have to take a taxi home.

175
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
No, you can do it.

176
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
You can do it.

177
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
But the program can't do it.

178
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I can't do it.

179
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
You can't do it.

180
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I'm sorry, but I'm late for downtown.

181
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Someone come here.

182
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
It was 5 o'clock today.

183
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:15,000
But in the end, downtown was ready at 7.30.

184
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:21,000
What were you doing?

185
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I have nothing to say.

186
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
What were you doing?

187
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I can hit you anytime.

188
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
What were you doing?

189
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I have nothing to say.

190
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Let's go.

191
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Wait.

192
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Don't make me late.

193
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
You were late.

194
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I wasn't late at all.

195
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
You were late.

196
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I wasn't late at all.

197
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
You were late for two and a half hours.

198
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:56,000
You were late for two and a half hours.

199
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Wait.

200
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,000
You didn't catch up.

201
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I thought you threw your shoes, but you couldn't do it.

202
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
It's your fault that everyone was late.

203
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
No.

204
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Then, where is Yuho?

205
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Yuho was late.

206
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Then, where is Yuho?

207
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Yuho was late.

208
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I wanted you to hit me.

209
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
You're crazy.

210
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
You're crazy.

211
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Do you understand?

212
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:36,000
In the end, parents and teachers don't hit the bad guys.

213
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:41,000
That's why bad guys become bad guys.

214
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I'm the type of person who is late.

215
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I'm a person who doesn't eat much.

216
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I'm a person who doesn't eat much.

217
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I'm a person who doesn't eat much.

218
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I was waiting for you to hit me for about an hour.

219
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I was waiting for you to hit me for about an hour.

220
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Who?

221
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Me.

222
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I thought you would hit me if I was late for more than two hours.

223
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I was late for two and a half hours.

224
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
But you said,

225
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I was going to hit you.

226
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I was going to hit you.

227
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
What are you talking about?

228
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
You're going to be late.

229
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
That was your idea.

230
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
He hit me.

231
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
That makes sense.

232
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I think it's fine.

233
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Yes.

234
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Well...

235
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Yuho,

236
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I saw the weather forecast.

237
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
You saw it?

238
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Yes.

239
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
It was Wednesday, right?

240
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I was out of luck last week.

241
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I was out of luck, and I saw a heavy snowstorm.

242
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
For two days in a row?

243
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Yes, for two days in a row.

244
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
The next day, Thursday, it was 11 o'clock.

245
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
It was 11 o'clock again!

246
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
It wasn't a snowstorm.

247
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
If it wasn't a snowstorm, I'd be angry again.

248
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
If it was, then it was a snowstorm.

249
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
If it was, then it was a heavy snowstorm.

250
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
It wasn't a big one.

251
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
It wasn't a big one.

252
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
The next day, Friday, it was 10 o'clock again.

253
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
It was terrible, wasn't it?

254
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
It was going up.

255
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
It was going up.

256
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
It was terrible.

257
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
It wasn't a snowstorm.

258
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
It wasn't a snowstorm.

259
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I was watching it from 4.55.

260
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
It was 5.55, and I was like, what's going on?

261
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
It wasn't a snowstorm at all.

262
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Then, it was 11 o'clock.

263
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I was like, wow!

264
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
It was 5.55, and it was terrible.

265
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I know.

266
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:46,000
What's with this light-hearted argument?

267
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
No, really.

268
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I said so much, but you didn't listen to me.

269
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I couldn't get up.

270
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I was like, on Monday,

271
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
on the day of the awakening,

272
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,000
every week, I was looking forward to downtown matcha.

273
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
You said that.

274
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I was like, are you kidding me?

275
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
What's with this?

276
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
That day, it was 2 o'clock or something.

277
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
And then, it was a little late.

278
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I was a little drunk on Monday.

279
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I was a little drunk on Monday.

280
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I was drunk.

281
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
No, no, no.

282
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
It was just a coincidence.

283
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
And then, from Monday to Wednesday,

284
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I didn't watch it once.

285
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I only watched the bad parts.

286
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I didn't watch the good parts.

287
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I was drunk on that day.

288
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,000
You shouldn't say that.

289
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
You know what?

290
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
You were number one again.

291
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
You were the light of a pecan.

292
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Really?

293
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
You were the light of a pecan again.

294
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
You were the light of a pecan.

295
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Stop it.

296
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
That's why you were the light of a pecan.

297
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
What?

298
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I'm so angry.

299
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I'm really angry.

300
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Seriously.

301
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Really.

302
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
If I were Tanaka Kakuhei,

303
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I would have done it many times.

304
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
What?

305
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
What do you mean?

306
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
But you said that to me,

307
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
and you said it would get better.

308
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
No, no, no.

309
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I got better because I was told to.

310
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
It just happened.

311
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
You kept saying that to yourself.

312
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
You kept saying that to yourself.

313
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
You're acting like an adult.

314
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
You're acting like an adult.

315
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
You're acting like an adult.

316
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
You're acting like an adult.

317
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I'm an adult.

318
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
No, no.

319
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I'm the one who's acting like an adult.

320
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I didn't say that.

321
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I'm the one who's acting like an adult.

322
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Kakeoka,

323
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I'm a big guy.

324
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I'm a big guy.

325
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Who?

326
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Who?

327
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
He's an idiot.

328
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I'm an idiot.

329
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I'm an idiot.

330
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Animals and birds.

331
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,000
We can understand the feelings of living things.

332
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
The first bird to fly is...

333
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,000
What made it fly?

334
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
You don't know that?

335
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
First of all,

336
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
you can say that it's the first bird to fly,

337
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
and you think that it's the leader.

338
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
That's the mistake?

339
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
That's the mistake.

340
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
But isn't it usually like that?

341
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,000
I think it's sad that you don't understand that.

342
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
For example,

343
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
a cat chases a mouse,

344
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
and it goes like this.

345
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Everyone thinks that a mouse is weak to a cat.

346
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Yes, yes, yes.

347
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
That's up to you.

348
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
It's up to you.

349
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
A mouse may be like this.

350
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Come here.

351
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Come here.

352
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Come here.

353
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Come here.

354
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Come here.

355
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Come here.

356
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Come here.

357
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Come here.

358
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
You may not understand what I'm saying.

359
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
If you understand, why can't you understand?

360
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Hurry up! Hurry up!

361
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
You're talking nonsense!

362
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
What are you talking about?

363
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I'm not talking nonsense.

364
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
You're talking nonsense.

365
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,000
There's something like that.

366
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Do you understand?

367
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
That's funny.

368
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
That's what it is.

369
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Don't put what you see in your head.

370
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
This is one of the things we're going to study today.

371
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
This time, we're going to talk about crossing the line.

372
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
We're going to cross the line.

373
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:28,000
But the one who crosses the line first is the leader.

374
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Well, that's a lie.

375
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
That's why.

376
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
What?

377
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Hold on.

378
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
The one who crosses the line...

379
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Yes, please.

380
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
The second one is the leader.

381
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Huh? Why?

382
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,000
You're the first one to jump.

383
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Okay, let's go.

384
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Who are you?

385
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I'm the second one.

386
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
I'm the real leader.

387
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I'm the second one.

388
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Oh, the second one.

389
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Oh, that's right.

390
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Shut up.

391
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Don't talk nonsense.

392
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I'm looking at a human being.

393
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
So why are you looking at a human being?

394
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I don't care what other people think.

395
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
They think they're looking at a human being.

396
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Oh, that's what it is.

397
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
That's right.

398
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Shut up.

399
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,000
That's what they say, and the first one jumps.

400
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Stop it.

401
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
I don't want to.

402
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I don't want to kick your ass.

403
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:27,000
I'm kicking your ass.

404
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I don't want to.

405
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
I don't want to.

406
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:35,000
So if you look at the ass of the first bird, it's a triangle.

407
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,000
There's mud on it.

408
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
There's mud on it.

409
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,000
There's mud on it.

410
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
It's like a lion.

411
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
It's running away in the deer, but it's a little rough.

412
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
My mom says,

413
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
When the lion says,

414
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
When the lion says,

415
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Run away.

416
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
No, no, run away.

417
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,000
If it's a deer, it's a real bad thing.

418
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
If you run away, don't come back to this program.

419
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:14,000
If you run away, don't come back to this program.

420
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
The deer is delicious.

421
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
It's delicious, but it's eaten at the end.

422
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
No, it's only when the deer is running.

423
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
It's eaten here.

424
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
How many years have you been in the world of TV?

425
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
You know that, don't you?

426
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
But it's natural.

427
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:36,000
There's something like that.

428
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
The lion came and said,

429
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
The lion came and said,

430
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Excuse me.

431
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Thank you very much.

432
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
It's okay.

433
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,000
It's okay.

434
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
I really wanted you to come here.

435
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,000
The teacher came and said,

436
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:01,000
I'm counting on you from now on.

437
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:07,000
I have a question for Mr. Matsumoto.

438
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Please tell me how to hold a super fork that is said to be lower than the leader of Yokohama Sasaki.

439
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Oh, I see.

440
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
But I think Sasaki will hate this.

441
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Why?

442
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
If you get hit by a fork that falls lower than Sasaki on TV, you won't be able to stand up.

443
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
I don't care about that.

444
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Wow.

445
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
You have such a strong authority.

446
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
It's okay.

447
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
How about a super fork?

448
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
I understand that.

449
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Please tell me.

450
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
How do you teach me?

451
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
How do you hold a super fork?

452
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Oh, I see.

453
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Don't you have a ball?

454
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
If you have a ball...

455
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
You don't have a ball?

456
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Wait a minute.

457
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Why?

458
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
It's easy to hold a super fork.

459
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
If you don't have a ball, you can't hold a super fork.

460
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
It's okay.

461
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I'll look for it.

462
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Oh, here's the ball.

463
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Okay, I'll show you.

464
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
How to throw a super fork.

465
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:09,000
First, you have to hold it like this.

466
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
I asked you to help me.

467
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
You have to show me slowly.

468
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
What do you want me to do?

469
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Please hold the ball.

470
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
As if you don't have a ball.

471
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Because you are Kuroko.

472
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
You have to hold it like this.

473
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
And then...

474
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
You have to shake it like this.

475
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Wait a minute.

476
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Please do it until I throw it.

477
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
How do you throw it?

478
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Like this.

479
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Okay.

480
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
That's good.

481
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Okay.

482
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Don't jump!

483
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
This is...

484
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,000
This is a very good match.

485
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
This program is...
