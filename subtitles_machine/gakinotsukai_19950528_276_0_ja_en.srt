1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The usual scene of the school night

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
But for some reason I couldn't see that man

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Good morning

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Good morning

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Good morning

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Good morning

7
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Good morning

8
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Good morning

9
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I'm sorry

10
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Okamoto-san is still here

11
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
He left

12
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
He left

13
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I'll call him right back

14
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
He left

15
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Yes, I'm sorry

16
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I knew he would leave

17
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I knew it

18
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
All the staff told me to call him

19
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
They told me to call him right back

20
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I'm sorry

21
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
You always do that

22
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I can't do that

23
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Usually when you get angry you don't say it

24
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Right

25
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I'm sorry, anyway I'm sorry

26
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm sorry

27
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Junko house, Junko store

28
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Wait a minute

29
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
What are you memorizing?

30
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Junko house, Junko store

31
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
It's ok

32
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
It's ok

33
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
It's ok, let's go home

34
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Let's go home

35
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Let's go home

36
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
What?

37
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
What?

38
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
What?

39
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
What is he doing?

40
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
He's not angry today?

41
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
He's not angry

42
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
He's not angry

43
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
He's sleeping

44
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
He's sleeping

45
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
What?

46
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
He's sleeping

47
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Be quiet

48
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
What are you doing?

49
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
He's not sleeping

50
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
That's it

51
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I can't see

52
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
There's a mirror in front of you

53
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I saw it

54
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I'm so angry

55
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I'm so tired

56
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I'm so tired

57
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Let's not talk about it

58
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Your partner is angry

59
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Is that so?

60
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I didn't say that

61
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
What?

62
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I don't want to walk here

63
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I'm really sorry

64
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I'm really sorry

65
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I'm your partner

66
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I'm sorry

67
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I'm sorry

68
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
You guys are acting strange

69
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
What is that?

70
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I'm sorry

71
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I'm sorry

72
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I'm sorry

73
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I'm sorry

74
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
This

75
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
This

76
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Don't fight

77
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Don't fight

78
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Okay

79
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Okay

80
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Okay

81
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Okay

82
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Express your love

83
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Look at this

84
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
When I came out the other day

85
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Isn't it good?

86
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
It's good

87
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
It's good

88
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
It's good

89
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
You ran for 21 seconds

90
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
How many?

91
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
15

92
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
21

93
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
You ran for 15 seconds

94
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Why are you so behind?

95
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
That's because

96
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
You're running behind

97
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
You're still far

98
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I'm sure you edited it

99
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
What?

100
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
This is my opening

101
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I think you edited it a little

102
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Why are you editing this?

103
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Editing?

104
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
We'll have no time to talk

105
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Isn't that good?

106
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Why do you need to talk?

107
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
No, no

108
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I'm just a simple boy

109
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Is that so?

110
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
That's good

111
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
It's good that I'm the manager

112
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Are you going to do something?

113
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
What?

114
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Are you going to do something?

115
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
What?

116
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Human arrest

117
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Human arrest

118
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I'm going to do it

119
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Be careful

120
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Get ready

121
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
This program is brought to you by these sponsors

122
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Kodama-san

123
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Yes?

124
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I've prepared

125
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Human arrest

126
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Are you okay?

127
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I'm okay

128
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
It looks scary

129
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
It's scary

130
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
We can't do it

131
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Let's go

132
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
What are you going to do?

133
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I don't want to do it

134
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I don't want to do it

135
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
This guy is annoying

136
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Take care of it

137
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Yamagaki-san

138
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I can't do it

139
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
You have to catch it

140
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I can't do it

141
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
It's a talent

142
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Excuse me

143
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
It's scary

144
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Just one more time

145
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Okamoto-san, I'm going to raise the angle

146
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
You should be able to see the banana

147
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Catch the banana

148
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Raise it

149
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
It's high tech

150
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Let's see Okamoto-san

151
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Okamoto-san, are you okay?

152
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I can't do it anymore

153
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Let's do it like this

154
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Let's do it like this

155
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I'm sure you can do it

156
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I can't do it

157
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Please

158
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Okamoto-san

159
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Let's go

160
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Fire in 5 seconds

161
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:43,000
4, 3, 2, 1

162
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
It's stuck in my head

163
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Okamoto-san, you can't catch it

164
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Okamoto-san, the banana

165
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I can't do it anymore

166
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
It's too scary

167
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Okamoto-san, come over here

168
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I can't do it anymore

169
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Okamoto-san, you can't do it anymore

170
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Let's go

171
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Okamoto-san, please raise the camera

172
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Thank you for your hard work

173
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Okamoto-san, you can't do it anymore

174
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
What?

175
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
You're doing it again

176
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I did it again

177
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Why?

178
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Everyone is disappointed

179
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Is that so?

180
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I did it again

181
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
It's fine

182
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
You have to buy that

183
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I don't want to sell it

184
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I'll sell it

185
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I just did it in the corner

186
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I'll sell it

187
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
You don't have to sell it

188
00:09:41,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I can't do it anymore

189
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Good evening

190
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
It's getting hot

191
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Can you do it?

192
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I can't do it anymore

193
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I forgot

194
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
You can't change it

195
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Don't touch it

196
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I can't do it anymore

197
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I can't do it anymore

198
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
It's not like that

199
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
It's not like that

200
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
That's right

201
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
You have a good face

202
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
You have a good face

203
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
You have a good face

204
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
You have a good face

205
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
The other day

206
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
What?

207
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
When we were shooting Gotts

208
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Wada Akio came

209
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
He left a message

210
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
He said he'll call back

211
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
He said he'll call back

212
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I thought it was a car accident

213
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I thought it was a car accident

214
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Suddenly after Gotts

215
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I got a message

216
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I said I'm sorry

217
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I said I have something to talk about

218
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I said I don't have anything

219
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
You were like a talker

220
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I was like that for 2 hours

221
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I was like that for 2 hours

222
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I thought it would be fine

223
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I thought it would be fine

224
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I called him

225
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I called him

226
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I thought it was a party

227
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I knew my purpose

228
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I knew my purpose

229
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I knew why he couldn't drink anymore

230
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I knew why he couldn't drink anymore

231
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I knew why he couldn't drink anymore

232
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Really?

233
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
He was trying to get me

234
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Scary

235
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
He got angry

236
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
He got angry

237
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
He touched

238
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
You're lying

239
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
You're lying

240
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
It's scary!

241
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Damn it

242
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
It's true

243
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
It's so cool, it makes you want to puke

244
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
What do you mean?

245
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
The guy who got killed by a wada

246
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
But if you take a picture of him

247
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
It would be amazing

248
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Wada Akiho Matsumoto

249
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Three times

250
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I'll take a picture of him like this

251
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
It's scary

252
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
It's so cool

253
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I can't fit such a fat guy

254
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Can you fit him?

255
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
You can't?

256
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
You can fit him

257
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Me?

258
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
That's not true

259
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
You can fit him

260
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I'm really sorry

261
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
That's not true

262
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
What's wrong with you?

263
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
If you don't stand up, you'll get hit

264
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
If I don't stand up, I'll get hit

265
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Are you underestimating me?

266
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Are you underestimating me?

267
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
If I don't stand up, I'll be told to stand up

268
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Then I'll get hit

269
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
First, I'll be told to stand up

270
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Then you'll be told to stand up

271
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I'm like Hanaka

272
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I want to see it

273
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I'm sorry, I'll bring a tissue

274
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I really want to invite Hamada

275
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
But he has a family

276
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Thank you

277
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I don't want to invite him

278
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I really wanted to get married at that time

279
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
You wanted to get away from that?

280
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I wanted to get away from that organization

281
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I thought I had to get married

282
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
You should have read the organization

283
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I'm really sorry

284
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I really wanted to avoid that

285
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I can't do anything about it

286
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
What are you doing?

287
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I really wanted to avoid that

288
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I'm sorry

289
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I was really scared

290
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Take this too

291
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
But I really...

292
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I think everyone is waiting for that

293
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
You'll get hit

294
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I think I'll fight in court

295
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
You'll go to jail?

296
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I'll go to jail

297
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I can't do anything about it

298
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
So it's better to get hit

299
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Do it

300
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I can't do it

301
00:14:45,000 --> 00:15:09,120
I need a

302
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,000
I can't do it

303
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I can't do it

304
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
There was a guy who annoyed me

305
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Who?

306
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
He's not a celebrity

307
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
What?

308
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
He's a celebrity

309
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
He went to eat

310
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
It's like a family restaurant

311
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
You can see the parking lot while eating

312
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,000
He's brushing his teeth

313
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
At the parking lot?

314
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
At the parking lot

315
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I was drinking wine

316
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,000
You're drinking wine at a family restaurant?

317
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I've been eating for 70 years

318
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I've been eating

319
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I've been drinking

320
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Okay

321
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Don't look at me like that

322
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I'm not stupid

323
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I forgive you

324
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
It's okay

325
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I've been eating

326
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
At first I ignored it

327
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
When someone tells you not to brush your car

328
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I'm brushing it

329
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I'm brushing it first

330
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,000
And then I look at it

331
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I can't see

332
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I can't see

333
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I'm panicking

334
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
This is this

335
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
That's that

336
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
And then, he finally finished brushing his teeth

337
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Right?

338
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Next time, he'll bring out a handkerchief or tissue and brush his teeth with an antenna

339
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
How cute!

340
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,000
He'll blow on the round part of the antenna like this

341
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Are you serious?

342
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I'm not lying

343
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I don't know if he's going to pick up his girlfriend

344
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,000
He didn't plan to do that. He was doing it the whole time

345
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Even though he was brushing his antenna, he couldn't get any messages

346
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
What are you waiting for?

347
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
When he opens the door, he opens it like this

348
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
He doesn't put on his shoelaces

349
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
That's right. This is where he closes the door

350
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
When he touches the handkerchief, he looks at it like this

351
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I'm going to brush you!

352
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I'm going to brush you!

353
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Why do cats stand up even if they fall from high places?

354
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Why do they stand up?

355
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Let's say this

356
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
They stand up even if they're not cats

357
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
They don't stand up

358
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Even if they're horses

359
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Let's try to make a horse stand up

360
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
At the opening of the show

361
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
It's not that high

362
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Let's try to make a horse fall from a really high place

363
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
It's not that high

364
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
That's impossible

365
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
You've never seen a horse fall from a shelf, right?

366
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
No

367
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I've seen it many times

368
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Have you ever eaten while watching it?

369
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Where can I watch it?

370
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Where can I watch it?

371
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
In a small pub

372
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I want to go to a small pub

373
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
In a small pub

374
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Why is the cord of the phone spinning?

375
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
But it's not spinning

376
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
If we put it in a straight line, isn't it pretty long?

377
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
It's an old man's idea

378
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Well, it's an old man

379
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Isn't it?

380
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
He's not that young

381
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
NTT guys

382
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
They only think about extending the story

383
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
That's right

384
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
If it's a straight line phone

385
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Hello?

386
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Hello?

387
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
By doing that

388
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Hello?

389
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Next

390
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
That's right

391
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:26,000
How many of Hamada's CDs did Yasashiki Matsumoto, who is called the mirror of Japanese people, buy?

392
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
He bought a lot

393
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
How many CDs did he sell?

394
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
I don't know how many he sold

395
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
He sold about 200,000 CDs

396
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I don't think he sold 200,000

397
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
He sold about 200,000

398
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
He sold about 1.9 million

399
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
That's right

400
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
But that

401
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
There's no one who said, I bought a CD

402
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Then why did you sell 1.9 million?

403
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Wait a minute

404
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Don't say something that makes me cry

405
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
That's right

406
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:13,000
What?

407
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Matsumoto-san, why can't you smile like that?

408
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
How is it?

409
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Hey

410
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
What kind of smile?

411
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Hey

412
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Hey

413
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
It's disgusting

414
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Disgusting?

415
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Smile more normally

416
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Smile more normally

417
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Disgusting

418
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Smile normally

419
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Most people, for example

420
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:59,000
If a person with a face of 50 points smiles, the 5 points will decrease

421
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Do you understand?

422
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Is that so?

423
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,000
If you smile, it will be more disgusting, but if you smile, it will be 45 points

424
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
You already have a 40 points face

425
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
You already have a 40 points face

426
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Don't hide your 40 points face

427
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Wow, 40 points

428
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
You already have 40 points

429
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Everyone said that

430
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
What kind of answer is that?

431
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Everyone in Fuji's family said that

432
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
But

433
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
That's the story

434
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Everyone said that only Matsumoto will smile and become even more disgusting

435
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Who said that?

436
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Everyone said that

437
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
My family said that

438
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Your family said that?

439
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
My family said that only Matsumoto will smile and become even more disgusting

440
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
You guys are Matsumoto too

441
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Only us

442
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Only our family

443
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I can understand that

444
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Everyone said that

445
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Everyone said that only Matsumoto will smile and become even more disgusting

446
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Is that so?

447
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
It's like you're planning something

448
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
That's not true

449
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
You're the only one who said that

450
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Well, you're like that too

451
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
You said it as a joke

452
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
That's not true

453
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Why did you say it as a joke?

454
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
You're overreacting

455
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
I'm not overreacting, it's natural

456
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
You're always like that

457
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
I'm sorry

458
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Do you say that?

459
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
It's disgusting if you're like that

460
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
I'm sorry for that time

461
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
That's why I said it

462
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Hey, smile

463
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Show us a smile that will increase your score

464
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
There are many ways to smile

465
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Is that so?

466
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Smile

467
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Smile

468
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
It's natural

469
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Smile

470
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
It's not natural

471
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
It's natural

472
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Why can't I see it?

473
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
It's not the best

474
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Is that so?

475
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
It's the best

476
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
It's the best

477
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Okay, I got it

478
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
There's nothing more than this

479
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
This is a smile that will increase your score

480
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Yes, a smile that will increase your score

481
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
A smile that will make everyone happy

482
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Yes

483
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Please

484
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
It's a smile that will make everyone happy

485
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
It's a smile that will make everyone happy

486
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
This is the best

487
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
If you smile that much, you can't see your teeth

488
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
If I smile that much?

489
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Yes

490
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
When you smile, your teeth will show

491
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Why can't I see it?
