1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
It's cold, isn't it?

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Good evening.

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
What month is it now?

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
It's the opening, isn't it?

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Yes, it's the opening.

6
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
It's strange, isn't it?

7
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I heard that the players will be gone.

8
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
These guys are really annoying.

9
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Why do you have to gather such a thing?

10
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
With a kotatsu and a yutampo.

11
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
It's warm, isn't it?

12
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Don't mess with me!

13
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
This is...

14
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
There's nothing colder than a kotatsu without electricity.

15
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
This is the coldest, isn't it?

16
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I prepared a kotatsu just for this.

17
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
It's cold, isn't it?

18
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I heard that the strobe is short today, but it's not.

19
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
If you walk, it's long.

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Look at this.

21
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
It's a good kotatsu.

22
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
It's cold.

23
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
It's funny to see the back, isn't it?

24
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
It's cold.

25
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Oh, come on!

26
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Here, here.

27
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Tsunami Kuritsu.

28
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Hamadayama Kaikan.

29
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
You guys are dangerous.

30
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

31
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I told you not to do this!

32
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I got hit by a bat.

33
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Hey!

34
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
My head hurts.

35
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
It's cold.

36
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Let's put on the kotatsu.

37
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I see.

38
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Why are you still here?

39
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Are you a woman?

40
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Look at this.

41
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
What is this?

42
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
What is this?

43
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Is it a bath bomb?

44
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
It's a bath bomb.

45
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I thought it would be like this.

46
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
If you say so, it's cold.

47
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
You guys should take a bath.

48
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
It's cold here.

49
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Today's...

50
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I don't have a bath bomb.

51
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
This is Hamadayama.

52
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Hamadayama Kaikan.

53
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Yes.

54
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Let's start.

55
00:01:46,000 --> 00:02:10,000
This program is brought to you by Sunluck, Soyou Suisan, and Oyama International Products.

56
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Ojiichan!

57
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Yes.

58
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Everyone.

59
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Yes.

60
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Today, I heard that a dangerous criminal is here.

61
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
What?

62
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I don't know how scary he is.

63
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Yes.

64
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Be careful.

65
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Yes.

66
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Don't look at me.

67
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I got fired today.

68
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Thank you.

69
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Is it your first job?

70
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Yes.

71
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Did you press the time card?

72
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Yes.

73
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I'm nervous because it's my first job.

74
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I'm a veteran detective.

75
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Yes.

76
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
If you have something to steal, steal it from me.

77
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Yes.

78
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
But stealing from a detective is a strange story.

79
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Let's do our best.

80
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Thank you.

81
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
But I have to give you a nickname.

82
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
What?

83
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I have to give you a nickname.

84
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
A nickname?

85
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Yes.

86
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Why do you have a nickname?

87
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
It's obvious.

88
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
It's the same when I show Soyou Suisan.

89
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Yes.

90
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I have a nickname.

91
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Oh, I see.

92
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
If I don't give you a nickname, it won't start.

93
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Like G-Pant.

94
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Yes.

95
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Like Texas.

96
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Soyou.

97
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Yes.

98
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Soyou.

99
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
What's your name?

100
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Hamada.

101
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
This is Hamada.

102
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Yes.

103
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
When you say something, say Hamada.

104
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
It's hard to say.

105
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
You can say it.

106
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
You can say it now, but you can't say it when you're nervous.

107
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
You can say Hamada.

108
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
What's your nickname?

109
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Masatoshi.

110
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Masatoshi.

111
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Hamada Masatoshi.

112
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
You can't say it.

113
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
You can say it clearly.

114
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
What do you think?

115
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I'll give you a nickname.

116
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Hamada.

117
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
It's okay to say Hamada.

118
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
You can say it.

119
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
What's your hobby?

120
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
My hobby is reading records.

121
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Reading records.

122
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Anything else?

123
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I'm young, but I play bonsai.

124
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Reading records and playing bonsai?

125
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Yes.

126
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Okay, it's decided.

127
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Yes.

128
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I play records.

129
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Good luck.

130
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I play records.

131
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Nice to meet you.

132
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Yes.

133
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
It's better to say Hamada.

134
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Where is the criminal?

135
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I'm here.

136
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
You're here, too?

137
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
What a scary guy.

138
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
It's hard to do this position, so change the position.

139
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I'm here.

140
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I've been fooled.

141
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I've decided to say Hamada.

142
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
You idiot.

143
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Stop playing records.

144
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
What are you doing?

145
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Don't call me Hamada because you've decided.

146
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Let me go.

147
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Shut up.

148
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Don't come.

149
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
What?

150
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Don't come close.

151
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Shut up.

152
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I'm angry.

153
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Shut up.

154
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Don't come close.

155
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
If you come close I'll shoot you.

156
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Shut up.

157
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I'll shoot him.

158
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Shut up.

159
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I'll shoot him.

160
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Hey.

161
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Are you kidding me?

162
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
L disadvantageous situation.

163
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Don't move.

164
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
If you move.

165
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I'll shoot him with one shot.

166
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I''ll shoot him with two.

167
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Don't move.

168
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
It's better to shoot him by one shot.

169
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I don't like your poker face.

170
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I won't shut up.

171
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Is this a conversation between a detective and a criminal?

172
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Stop it.

173
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Stay away from me.

174
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Lend me your sword.

175
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Stay away from me or I'll shoot you.

176
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Okay, I got it.

177
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Look.

178
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
As you can see, I have a big butt.

179
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Shut up.

180
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
You have a big butt.

181
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I have a big waist.

182
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Stop it.

183
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Lend me your sword.

184
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I'll shoot you if you move.

185
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,000
What?

186
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I'll shoot you if you come forward.

187
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Lend me your sword.

188
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I'll shoot you.

189
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
You'll shoot me if I come forward?

190
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Do you think I'm scared of you?

191
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I'll shoot you.

192
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Stay away from me.

193
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I'll shoot you if you move forward.

194
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
You have a big butt.

195
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Lend me your sword.

196
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I'll shoot you if you come forward.

197
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I'll shoot you.

198
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I'll shoot you.

199
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Stop it.

200
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I won't shoot you.

201
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I'll shoot you.

202
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Lend me your sword.

203
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I'll shoot you.

204
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Stop it.

205
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I'll shoot you.

206
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I'll shoot you.

207
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Don't do anything you don't like.

208
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
What kind of sword?

209
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
You're a scary guy.

210
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
It's you.

211
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
It can't be helped.

212
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
It's a good strategy.

213
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Who are you talking to?

214
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Nobody is talking to me.

215
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I have no choice but to go with a good strategy.

216
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I don't care.

217
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
You.

218
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
What?

219
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Do you know what that is?

220
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
What?

221
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
That's it.

222
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
What is that?

223
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
What?

224
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
That's it.

225
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I don't know.

226
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
What is it?

227
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Do you know Toure Carpet?

228
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
What?

229
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
You're wrong.

230
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Do you know Russian Roulette?

231
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I don't know at all.

232
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
What is Russian Roulette and Toure Carpet?

233
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
There is only one bullet in this pistol.

234
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I don't know where it is.

235
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Why don't we shoot each other with each other's rice paper?

236
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
The unlucky one will die.

237
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
How about this rule?

238
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
It's okay.

239
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
It looks interesting.

240
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
You first.

241
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Why is it from me?

242
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
The first shot is less likely.

243
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Please.

244
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:37,000
What are you afraid of?

245
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:43,000
It's dangerous the next time.

246
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
It's dangerous the next time.

247
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
You.

248
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Don't shoot me.

249
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
It's dangerous the next time.

250
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
It's dangerous the next time.

251
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
You.

252
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Die.

253
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
How many times have you been shot?

254
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Do you want to die with a joke?

255
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Are you serious?

256
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Stop it.

257
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
What is it?

258
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
This is a real man-to-man game.

259
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
What is it?

260
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
What?

261
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
What are you doing?

262
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Stand facing each other and walk forward.

263
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Don't step on each other.

264
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Don't step on each other.

265
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Don't step on each other.

266
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Don't step on each other.

267
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Don't step on each other.

268
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Don't step on each other.

269
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Cut it.

270
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Don't step on each other.

271
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Stand facing each other.

272
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Walk forward.

273
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Step forward.

274
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Look back and shoot me.

275
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Calm down.

276
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Stand facing each other.

277
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Stand facing each other.

278
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Stand facing each other.

279
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
How many times have you been shot?

280
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
It's dangerous the next time.

281
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Who are you talking to?

282
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Who am I?

283
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I'm Ryoki.

284
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Let's go.

285
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Let's go.

286
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Stand facing each other.

287
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Walk forward.

288
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Step forward.

289
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Look back and shoot me.

290
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
This is the rule that the slow one will die.

291
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Don't step on each other.

292
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Don't step on each other.

293
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Don't step on each other.

294
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Do you understand?

295
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
It's a walk.

296
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
That's right.

297
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
It's a walk.

298
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Yes.

299
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
If you make it clear, you're risking your life.

300
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
It's about two or three steps.

301
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
It's about two or three steps.

302
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
It's about two or three steps.

303
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
If you make it clear, it's a walk.

304
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Yes.

305
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
It's a walk.

306
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
If you compete with the world, it's about three or mostly.

307
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Tell me.

308
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
How many steps?

309
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
It's a walk.

310
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
It's a walk.

311
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
It's a walk.

312
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
It's a walk.

313
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
It's a walk.

314
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
It's a walk.

315
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Tell me it's a walk.

316
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
It's a walk.

317
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
It's a walk.

318
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Yes.

319
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Let's go!

320
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Are you ready?

321
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Yes!

322
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Let's go!

323
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
One, two...

324
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I said two, didn't I?

325
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
You said three!

326
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I was thinking in the middle and didn't understand.

327
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Sorry.

328
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I said three.

329
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Hey.

330
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Am I going to die?

331
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I didn't ask you.

332
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I want to ask you one last thing.

333
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
What?

334
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
What did I do?

335
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
What did I do?

336
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I don't know.

337
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
What did I do? I didn't do anything!

338
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
What did I do?

339
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
What did I do?

340
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
But you ran away with my hair, didn't you?

341
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
You were just jogging!

342
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
You should have worn a jersey.

343
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Why did you come to me?

344
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
What did I do?

345
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Don't do that again.

346
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
There are women who sleep with you.

347
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Me?

348
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:10,000
What did I do?

349
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
What did I do?

350
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:09,880
You're a

351
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
What did I do?

352
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Tell me!

353
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I'm scared!

354
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:35,000
That's the end of the story.

355
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Thank you very much.

356
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Today's story is pretty good, isn't it?

357
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
It's good, isn't it?

358
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
You can do it anywhere.

359
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
It's been a big hit for a month.

360
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
It's been a big hit for a month.

361
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
We usually do it with four people.

362
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
We do it with two people.

363
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,000
So when we say, next is a good strategy, we're always here.

364
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
We don't say, that's right.

365
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,000
No one says that, so we say it in our hearts.

366
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
It was hard.

367
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
The other day, I took a taxi here.

368
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I told the taxi driver to go to Tokyo Station.

369
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
There's another taxi story.

370
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
There are so many stories.

371
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I'm sorry.

372
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
You may be watching this on TV, so it's hard to say.

373
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
He was a very energetic person.

374
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I told him to go to Tokyo Station.

375
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I'm watching.

376
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
It's Mr. Downton.

377
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Really?

378
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
It's very high.

379
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
It's Mr. Downton.

380
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I'm watching.

381
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Thank you very much.

382
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
It's the best, Mr. Downton.

383
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I'm not saying this because there are many customers.

384
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I really like it.

385
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
There are many young people now.

386
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
But...

387
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
But...

388
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Mr. Downton is the best.

389
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Why are you so high?

390
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
It's the best.

391
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Mr. Downton is the best.

392
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
It's good.

393
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I can praise him as much as I want.

394
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I'm also shy.

395
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
It's not like that.

396
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
But...

397
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Suddenly...

398
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Why are you so high?

399
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
But...

400
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Something is not right.

401
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
But...

402
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
There is one thing that is not right.

403
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
What is it?

404
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
What is it?

405
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I'm sorry to say this.

406
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
You don't have to say that.

407
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Please don't be angry.

408
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Mr. Aikata...

409
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Are you serious?

410
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Are you serious?

411
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
What?

412
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Mr. Aikata is a little different.

413
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Why?

414
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I think you should do it alone.

415
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:01,000
If you do it alone, the next B and Takeshi will be you.

416
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Is that so?

417
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Mr. Aikata's bad words are...

418
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,000
The person who is taller is...

419
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:19,000
That's me.

420
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:25,000
The way you talk to your fans is good.

421
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
You are completely wrong.

422
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I'm not wrong about B21.

423
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Mr. Downton is right.

424
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
But you are wrong about B21.

425
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
You are a strange man.

426
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Mr. Aikata is not here.

427
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Mr. Aikata is not here.

428
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
He is talking about me.

429
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Let's introduce the postcards.

430
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Is that so?

431
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Yes.

432
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Postcards?

433
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
The postcards...

434
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Oh, thank you.

435
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Well...

436
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
You were looking for an assistant, right?

437
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Yes.

438
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Until now...

439
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
There was a person like that.

440
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Like this.

441
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I was looking for an assistant.

442
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I chose the person from the list for the first time.

443
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,000
You should be more surprised.

444
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
You gave me a letter.

445
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
That's right.

446
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
The letter...

447
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Oh, you put it in a big place.

448
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
It's really warm.

449
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I got this.

450
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
There is a photo.

451
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Please send me more of these.

452
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I really want to see it.

453
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
You wrote a history book for me.

454
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
That's right.

455
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
What is it?

456
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
The motivation of death.

457
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I thought it was interesting.

458
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Are you underestimating me?

459
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Don't call me that.

460
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Don't call me that.

461
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I'm in trouble.

462
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I thought it was strange.

463
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
It's strange, but you like downtown, right?

464
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Which one do you like?

465
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
You like it, don't you?

466
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,000
If Hamada and I were drowning, which one would you like?

467
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Which one do you like?

468
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I like all of them.

469
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
You're crazy.

470
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Your answer is always like that.

471
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
When I say it, you say it.

472
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
You always say it.

473
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Where do you say it?

474
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
What is it?

475
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
The voice.

476
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
The voice?

477
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
You're underestimating me.

478
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
The voice is good.

479
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
The voice is good.

480
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Is that so?

481
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Is that so?

482
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
What is it suddenly?

483
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I've never said that before.

484
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
There are things you like and don't like.

485
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
That's totally fine.

486
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Go over there.

487
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Hey!

488
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Thank you very much.

489
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Thank you very much.

490
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Please.

491
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Please give him a round of applause.

492
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,000
You sent me more cute girls than I expected.

493
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I'm surprised.

494
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
That's funny.

495
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Yes, yes.

496
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Now, I'm going to introduce the postcards.

497
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I've been doing Osaka-Benkotan for a long time.

498
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
But there aren't many.

499
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Well, then.

500
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
What do you mean, then?

501
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
When you say, then, in Tokyo dialect,

502
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
When you say, then, what do you say when you say, then?

503
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Bye-bye?

504
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
It's just like that.

505
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Well, then.

506
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Osaka.

507
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Then.

508
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Osaka people say then.

509
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Then.

510
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Then, then.

511
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Then, then.

512
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Then, then.

513
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
It's cool when you say goodbye.

514
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Then, then.

515
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Osaka people say then when they die.

516
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
You say it?

517
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
You can't speak.

518
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Have you ever heard it?

519
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
The guy before he died.

520
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Then, then.

521
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I said it at my house.

522
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Then, then.

523
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I said it at my house.

524
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I said it after I died.

525
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Well, then.

526
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I have some more time.

527
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
You have some more time.

528
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I'm watching UFO.

529
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
You're kidding!

530
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I'm watching UFO program.

531
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I had no time to write.

532
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
I'm watching UFO program.

533
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Me?

534
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I'm watching UFO program.

535
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I'm watching UFO program.

536
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I'm watching UFO program.

537
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
It's quite serious.

538
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Nittere.

539
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Please come.

540
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
It's so sad.

541
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Why is Nittere like this?

542
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I don't think so. It's a serious program, isn't it?

543
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
That's right.

544
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
What do you mean, that's right?

545
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
You're talking about the UFO flying in and taking a shit.

546
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
The aliens are like this.

547
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
They're sticking their faces out of the disk.

548
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
The aliens are sticking their backs out from behind.

549
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Who's going to believe it?

550
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I saw it the other day.

551
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Everyone's going to believe it.

552
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
A disk-shaped UFO.

553
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:49,000
It flew in like this.

554
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
A disk-shaped UFO?

555
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
At that point, it's already a disk.

556
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,000
There's a lot of things like the way it flies.

557
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
The UFO flew in like this.

558
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Suddenly, it flew in diagonally.

559
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
There were about three holes, and the hot water was dripping.

560
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:12,000
It looks like he's going to puke.

561
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
What is this?

562
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
This is funny.

563
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Don't laugh.

564
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I remember this.

565
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I invented something amazing.

566
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,000
When you lied, you said it was going to be like this.

567
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I think I'm going to get an award.

568
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
This is serious.

569
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,000
In Tokyo, well, it's the same everywhere in the country.

570
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,000
There are a lot of problems with parking lots.

571
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Parking next to the road.

572
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
It's in the way.

573
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I thought of a way to fix it.

574
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,000
A way to fix parking lots?

575
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
That's right.

576
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
The road will never be blocked.

577
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Never.

578
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I'll say it.

579
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
What is it?

580
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I'm going to make a car like this.

581
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Like this.

582
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I'm going to make a car that looks like a beetle.

583
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Even if you park next to the road, you can't go up.

584
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
The car is like this.

585
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Even if you connect five cars, you can't go up like this.

586
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Is it open here?

587
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:30,000
It's not open.

588
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
I thought about it again.

589
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
What?

590
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,000
It's a roller coaster.

591
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
It's like a play hub.

592
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:44,000
World's first experience of fear.

593
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:50,000
It says Miracle Coaster.

594
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,000
It's like looking at an idiot.

595
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Miracle Coaster.

596
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Only one person can ride it.

597
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,000
The driver is also on board.

598
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
It's like a roller coaster.

599
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
What kind of experience is it?

600
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
It's pitch black.

601
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
It's a narrow roller coaster.

602
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
There's nothing to do on a roller coaster.

603
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
It's narrow.

604
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I'm going to run.

605
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
When I started running, I felt like an actor.

606
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Hey!

607
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Get out of here!

608
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Get out of here!

609
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Get out of here!

610
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
I don't know if that's funny.

611
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Don't say this on your way home.

612
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I thought you were going to say it, but you grabbed the bell.

613
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Why did you do that?

614
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Let's repeat one thing.

615
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Let's go with a bad one.

616
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Let's go with a bad one.

617
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Let's go with a bad one.

618
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Let's go!

619
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
We're going home.

620
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Let's go!

621
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Let's go home.

622
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Are you listening?

623
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Let's do it.

624
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Let's do it.

625
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Are you practicing?

626
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Let's go!

627
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:22,000
I can't go home!

628
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Let's go!

629
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
That's all for tonight.

630
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
That's all for tonight.

631
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Let's go!

632
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Let's go!

633
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:43,000
This is the first time we've done it together.

634
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,000
How is it?

635
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I'm always next to you.

636
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,000
There's a lot of criminals, so there's about four of us.

637
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I had to do it while I was a criminal.

638
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Next week, I think I'll do a short one.

639
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
A short one?

640
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
I think so.

641
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Just one shot?

642
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Yeah.

643
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Yeah.

644
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Really?

645
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Yeah.

646
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Two or three minutes.

647
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Really?

648
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Yeah.

649
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
The story's that short?

650
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Yeah.

651
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Really?

652
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Yeah.

653
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:33,000
I don't think it's a bad thing that you're going to quit.

654
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
That's all for tonight.

655
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Let's do it.

656
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Let's go!

657
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:58,000
