1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
I don't want to see it too much.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Chikichiki! Naita Naita! Koraekirezu! Naitakkei! Grand Prix!

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
What is it today? Are you going to cry?

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I think you've seen a lot of TV movies so far.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
If you watch this, you'll start crying.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I asked them to put it out.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
From now on, it's in the back box one by one.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
It won't be all long.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I want you to watch it for a while.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
And when it comes out, I wonder if you're really crying when you see it.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
What about everyone?

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Are you a person who cries a lot?

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I am.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
You cry a lot.

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
You cry really fast.

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
You cry really fast.

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
What about you, Yamazaki?

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I cry a lot, too.

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Me, too?

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Yes, I cry a lot.

21
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I cry really fast.

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I'm a romanticist.

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
In Japan, it's called a romanticist tennis ball.

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm going to play in order.

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:47,000
First of all, Yamazaki.

26
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I'm a little...

27
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Let's see what's going on with Yamazaki.

28
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Yamazaki, please.

29
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Really?

30
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
It's true.

31
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Whose body is it?

32
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
It's the body of Pet Midler.

33
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
It's the mother's body.

34
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Oh, your mother is Pet Midler.

35
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
That's right.

36
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I'm going to be Nijiko from today.

37
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Next is Takasu.

38
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Takasu, please.

39
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I don't know what Takasu chose.

40
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Goodbye, mom.

41
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I loved you, mom.

42
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Don't forget me forever.

43
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Goodbye.

44
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Hakubi, Hakubi.

45
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Maoh.

46
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
It hurts.

47
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Maoh.

48
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Maoh.

49
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Goodbye.

50
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I love you forever.

51
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Maoh.

52
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Hakubi.

53
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
It was good on the way.

54
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I'm going to cry again.

55
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I'm crying.

56
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Takasu, please.

57
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Something.

58
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I'm getting goosebumps, but I'm not as high as I used to be.

59
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
You used to be high.

60
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I've been here a lot on the way.

61
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I'm tired.

62
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Let's keep going.

63
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Next, Sadachi.

64
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Yes.

65
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I want to go home.

66
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I want to go home.

67
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Let's go home.

68
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Let's go home together.

69
00:04:49,000 --> 00:05:01,580
Current

70
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Machine.

71
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,500
Mine!

72
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Mine!

73
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,500
Mine!

74
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,000
They're dead!

75
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,000
Why are you crying?

76
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:41,000
Yamazaki's crying too.

77
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
It's so good!

78
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Let's have Soga-chan come out too.

79
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Soga-chan, go ahead.

80
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
She's crying a lot, right?

81
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
She's crying!

82
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Soga-chan isn't crying.

83
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
She's crying.

84
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
She's crying a little.

85
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Oh, really.

86
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
That's how it is.

87
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
When we first came out on Nomugi Pass, everyone was laughing.

88
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Looking at it closely...

89
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Chi-san is good, right?

90
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Chi-ichi came out.

91
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Chi-ichi.

92
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Next, Otomo-kun.

93
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Yes.

94
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Yes.

95
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Otomo-kun was crying.

96
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Hey, you!

97
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Hurry up and come out!

98
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I can't do it anymore.

99
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Don't worry about me.

100
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I can end up like this anyway.

101
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
But what about Otomo-kun?

102
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Otomo-kun, please!

103
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Okay.

104
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Is it true?

105
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
So, it's a lie!

106
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
You're the one who said it.

107
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
The flies are...

108
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
The flies are...

109
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
There are no flies.

110
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I don't know what to do.

111
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Okay, next is Hamada-san.

112
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Hamada-san.

113
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
What is it?

114
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Let's go.

115
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I don't really know.

116
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Today, we have Nekota Katsutoshi-san, who has become the center of the Japanese men's volleyball world.

117
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:04,000
He's been practicing hard every day, thinking only about winning.

118
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Sometimes I wonder why we have to do it.

119
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:18,000
But since I was born with a man, I want to do something big in my life.

120
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
That's what volleyball is now.

121
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:30,000
When this life is over, let's build an ordinary life anywhere.

122
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Until then, there will be a lot of lonely and sad things, but I'll do my best.

123
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:47,000
At that time, imagine the figure of two people in the future, or the figure of a child going to see the cherry blossoms.

124
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Nekota Katsutoshi

125
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
You're wearing high heels.

126
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
You're wearing high heels.

127
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
How about Hamada-san?

128
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Please.

129
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Are you crying?

130
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
We shouldn't have done it at the first letter.

131
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I should have done it at that time.

132
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I called my brother to come to my house.

133
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I was watching it while doing it.

134
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I wanted to cry.

135
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I have a brother.

136
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I have a brother, so I can't cry.

137
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I remember holding back.

138
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
This is the last time.

139
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
This is the last time.

140
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I'm going.

141
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I'm going to open it now.

142
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Nekota Katsutoshi

143
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Chibu, let's go home.

144
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I don't want to go.

145
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Chibu, Chibu, Chibu.

146
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Dad.

147
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
That's right, that's right.

148
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
No matter what anyone says, Chibu will never do it.

149
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
All right, all right, all right.

150
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Dad.

151
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:55,000
All right, all right, all right.

152
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I don't know.

153
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Ladies and gentlemen.

154
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Hello, hello.

155
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
What is it?

156
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I don't know.

157
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Every season is a double course.

158
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I feel a little cold.

159
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I have a long entertainment life.

160
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Everyone is laughing like this from now on.

161
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
It's annoying.

162
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I thought it would be annoying if I could sell it.

163
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I was on the Shinkansen the other day.

164
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
That's the first time.

165
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I'm sleeping on the Shinkansen.

166
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I'm pretty tired.

167
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Shinkansen to Osaka.

168
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I'm sleeping on the Shinkansen.

169
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I'm sleeping on the Shinkansen.

170
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
What happened?

171
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I woke up and was asked to sign.

172
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I have to turn around.

173
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I'm turning around.

174
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:08,000
They are the same.

175
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I'm sorry.

176
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Sign.

177
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I don't know what to pay attention to.

178
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
There are too many people.

179
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Even before that, the president of the Shinkansen said,

180
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I will take a private room.

181
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I don't care.

182
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I don't care.

183
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I want to sit on a chair.

184
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I want to sit normally.

185
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I don't want anyone to come.

186
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I don't want to let anyone come.

187
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Why are you smiling?

188
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I'm a good person.

189
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I can't help it.

190
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I can't help it.

191
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I went to the New Year's party the other day.

192
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I'm reading a Shinkansen book.

193
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I'm reading it with naked.

194
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:14,000
And this year again, a celebrity came to Hawaii.

195
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Oh?

196
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
It's a surprise.

197
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
What is it?

198
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
The popular comedian D.T.H.M.

199
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
What?

200
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
There's no doubt about it.

201
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
This time, it seems like they went as a couple.

202
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
The one who came to the pub appeared alone.

203
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
He's waiting for you from here.

204
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Other than that, he took a few staff members with him, and he seemed to be in a good mood, so he scattered a lot of chips.

205
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
He was like this.

206
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
He scattered a lot of chips.

207
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,000
And finally, he went out with a blonde woman in net tights.

208
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Hey, who is M in the middle of studying abroad?

209
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I don't know if I followed my partner, but I don't think it's because they went as a couple.

210
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I don't think so.

211
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
What are you doing while you're married?

212
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
That's right.

213
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Why do you write a weekly magazine like that?

214
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Who says that?

215
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I don't know.

216
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Oh, there was this time.

217
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Stop Always

218
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
You have to write the same thing as I do.

219
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
That punk stopped my bad comment.

220
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I had to stay in the car.

221
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
You used to use someone else's bad words, but I had to use my own.

222
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:48,000
If I have an image that I am bad, Ilam always use my own bad words.

223
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I don't really use anyone's bad words.

224
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Look at this.

225
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
That's it.

226
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Don't say that.

227
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
The bad words are...

228
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
You are talking more and more.

229
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
The bad words are to say something that doesn't exist.

230
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
That's what the bad words are.

231
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I'm the most angry right now.

232
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
What are you talking about?

233
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
That guy.

234
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Wait a minute.

235
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Wait a minute.

236
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
It's the first day of the new year.

237
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
You can't say that.

238
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
He's the only one who's angry.

239
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Everyone's angry.

240
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
I don't know.

241
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I'll tell you.

242
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I'll just tell you.

243
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Shut up.

244
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I'll tell you everything I think.

245
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I'll tell you everything.

246
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
You judge.

247
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
He's selling it in a refreshing way.

248
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
He's selling it in a refreshing way.

249
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
It's refreshing.

250
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
It's not refreshing at all.

251
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
That's a bad word.

252
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
That's my guess.

253
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
But when I look at people and their faces,

254
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I don't know.

255
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I don't know if he's really like this.

256
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I've been right up to now.

257
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
But you shouldn't judge that.

258
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
That woman is definitely a little different.

259
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Well, that's fine.

260
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
It's refreshing.

261
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
It's refreshing.

262
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
It's selling.

263
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
It's selling in a refreshing way.

264
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
That's not it.

265
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
That's it.

266
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
He caught a man.

267
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
That's it.

268
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
That's a refreshing image.

269
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
It's wrong for two men to go abroad.

270
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
They don't have anything private.

271
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
They don't have anything private.

272
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
You can't say that.

273
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Why not?

274
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Everyone has a private.

275
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
But I don't want to say anything good.

276
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I'm going abroad.

277
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I'm going abroad.

278
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I'm going abroad.

279
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I'm going abroad.

280
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I'm going abroad.

281
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I'm going abroad.

282
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
What did you say?

283
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
You can't go.

284
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
You can't go.

285
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
You denied it all.

286
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
You can't go.

287
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
You can't go.

288
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I didn't say anything until then.

289
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
You can't go.

290
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
That's when you come back.

291
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
That's when you come back.

292
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
What?

293
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
It doesn't matter.

294
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
When you come back,

295
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
That's when you come back.

296
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
When you come back.

297
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
When you wear a hat,

298
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
When you wear a hat,

299
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
It's like that.

300
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I've been interviewed.

301
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I've been ignored.

302
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I can't imagine that.

303
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I can't do that.

304
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Why not?

305
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
If I say it more refreshingly,

306
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I can say,

307
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I had a good time.

308
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
But,

309
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I can't answer

310
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
when I'm interviewed

311
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
with glasses on.

312
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
That's a bad attitude.

313
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
What are you doing?

314
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
What are you doing?

315
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Why don't you listen to me?

316
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I can't go that far.

317
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
What?

318
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
You can't go that far.

319
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
That's the bad part.

320
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Talk to me from there.

321
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
You're so long.

322
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
You can't go like this.

323
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
You can't go that far.

324
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I can't connect with you.

325
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
You're so long.

326
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
And,

327
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I don't know what happened to my parents.

328
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
They are angry.

329
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
My mother is also angry.

330
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
And,

331
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
my sponsor is also saying a lot of things.

332
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
My agency told me a lot.

333
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
They told you?

334
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
They told me.

335
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
But,

336
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
if I go to Hawaii,

337
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
what's wrong with that?

338
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
If I say it again,

339
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I think,

340
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
she is funny.

341
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
She has guts.

342
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I think like that.

343
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
But,

344
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
if I go there for three days,

345
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I will shorten my hair.

346
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
I will put on make-up.

347
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
I will be fresh.

348
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
When you warm up your body,

349
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
why do you have a membrane?

350
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
What is it?

351
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
It's a barricade to protect.

352
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
It's not a barricade to protect.

353
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
But,

354
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
isn't it like that?

355
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
It's not like that.

356
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
It's not such a difficult problem.

357
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
What is it?

358
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
When you warm up your body,

359
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
why do you have a membrane?

360
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Simply speaking,

361
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
it's a cow skin.

362
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
No, no, no.

363
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Let me tell you one thing.

364
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:54,000
I'm also ready.

365
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
No, no, no.

366
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
What are you saying?

367
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Why is it like that?

368
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
What is it?

369
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
It's a cow skin.

370
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
It's a cow skin.

371
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Right?

372
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Everyone is saying yes.

373
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
No, no, no.

374
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Everyone is saying yes.

375
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
No, no, no.

376
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Everyone is saying yes.

377
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
What is it?

378
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
It's because my hair is like this.

379
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
It's because my hair is like this.

380
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
There are many useless things.

381
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
I don't need Anna.

382
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I don't need a coin.

383
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
I don't need a coin.

384
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I don't need to spend millions of yen on a birthday party.

385
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
I don't need to buy a kimono.

386
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Isn't it decreasing?

387
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
I don't even know what a tombstone is.

388
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Why?

389
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
I don't need Anna.

390
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
If you die, I want you to put it in a tombstone.

391
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Of course.

392
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
I want you to put it in a big stone.

393
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I want you to wear it every day.

394
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
That's a good idea.

395
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
You are a more dynamic person.

396
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Why?

397
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
If I were a dynamic person,

398
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
what would happen if I died?

399
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
What would happen to your bones?

400
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
I don't care about my bones.

401
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
What?

402
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I don't care.

403
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
It's like a glass under the TV.

404
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
It's like that.

405
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
My family is not in a good mood.

406
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
I fell down once and fell.

407
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:29,000
I fell down many times.

408
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
What should I do?

409
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
My bones are broken.

410
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
I'm a year old.

411
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I'm really like that.

412
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Why are you talking like that?

413
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
I can't stand up while I'm alive.

414
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I've been saving money since I couldn't sell it.

415
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
I'm not an oven toaster.

416
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Then don't bake it.

417
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
If you put aluminum foil on it.

418
00:21:51,000 --> 00:22:06,000
You have to fold it.
