1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
This program is brought to you by these sponsors.

2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The night is a cryo-kant.

3
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Good evening.

4
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Good evening.

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Today, I...

6
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I've reached the point where I have to go.

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
What's wrong?

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I'm in shock.

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm in shock, I'm in shock.

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
You're at the top.

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm surprised.

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Last week, there was a talk show, right?

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
At that time, you got angry, right?

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I got angry?

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Your role, what's your role?

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
And then I went in.

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
What's your job?

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
What's your job?

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
What's your job?

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Why are you here? What's your job?

21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I'm a model.

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
You can't say it loudly.

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
You can't say it loudly, right?

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I'm a model.

25
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Right?

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Yes.

27
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
There are people who think Hamada is really angry.

28
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Why?

29
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I'm shocked by this.

30
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
It can't be.

31
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
It can't be.

32
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Where did you get this information?

33
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
There are quite a few.

34
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
There's something like that before.

35
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Why can't you understand it?

36
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
There's a series of Itao, right?

37
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Yes, yes.

38
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
There is.

39
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
The one that Itao was watching.

40
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
He really thinks Itao is that kind of person.

41
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Tokira-san said that.

42
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Why did you say that?

43
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Tell me!

44
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
It's amazing that you believe it.

45
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
It's scary.

46
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
This one, if it happens...

47
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
It's a show.

48
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Itao was hit by a rocket launcher.

49
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
When he opened the trunk, the stew spilled out.

50
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
It was a foreign person.

51
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Why do you think that it's not like that?

52
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I don't know.

53
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I don't know.

54
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Even if you say that, it's like that.

55
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Really.

56
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
The other day, I was bullied in a good way.

57
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
In your mind?

58
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Yes, in my mind.

59
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
It was really good.

60
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Hamada was like this.

61
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
If I extended the time a little more, I would cry.

62
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Really, really.

63
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
If I pulled it a little more, I might cry.

64
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
It feels good.

65
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Even though it's like that...

66
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Even though it's like that...

67
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
It's just because you're bad at it.

68
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Even if it's like that...

69
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I don't know.

70
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I'm frustrated.

71
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I'm frustrated with Hamada-kun.

72
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Who?

73
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Senpai.

74
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I'm really angry.

75
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
It's the same with Itao.

76
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
What is it?

77
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
How many of those people are there?

78
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
But if it's a person who likes kids and watches them all the time, I think they'll understand.

79
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I've been doing this for 10 years.

80
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I don't even know anymore.

81
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
It's like a skit.

82
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
The other day, when I said something, the audience was laughing.

83
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
There's no way to use that.

84
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
If I get angry, I'll be like this again.

85
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
If you say that,

86
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Last week, when I saw Suga-chan, she was wearing a skirt like that all the time.

87
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
That kind of thing.

88
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
So, really, wake up!

89
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Seriously!

90
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Suga-chan has been wearing a skirt all the time.

91
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
She's over 40.

92
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
There's no point in saying she's over 40.

93
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
If she's 18 years old, it's fine.

94
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
That's right, but...

95
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
You can tell that she's doing it on purpose.

96
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Why can't you tell me?

97
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
But it's more than I thought.

98
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I was really surprised.

99
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
What should I do?

100
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
What should you do?

101
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
What's the truth?

102
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I don't know.

103
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
You did it somewhere today, too.

104
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I did it somewhere today, too.

105
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
But if I'm bad at it, even if I say it like this,

106
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
No, that's not it.

107
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I don't think she's bad at it, so I'm just saying it.

108
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
At that time, Hana-chan was really angry.

109
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
That's why she came out again.

110
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
What should I do?

111
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
What should I do?

112
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I'll try not to get angry.

113
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
That's why.

114
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I'll never get angry.

115
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I'll never get angry.

116
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I don't know who you're talking to.

117
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I don't think you saw all the kids from last week.

118
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
But you've seen some of them, haven't you?

119
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
If you feel like you're really angry, just raise your hand.

120
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I won't get angry.

121
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I won't do anything.

122
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I won't jump around and hug you.

123
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I'm really...

124
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Actually, I'm a little...

125
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
You are?

126
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
If there's anyone who thinks so,

127
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I'd like you to say his name.

128
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Do you want me to say it?

129
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Raise your hand.

130
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:10,000
You are?

131
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Isn't it?

132
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I think Hamada was really angry.

133
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Is that so?

134
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I don't like it anymore.

135
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I don't like it anymore.

136
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I don't know what to say.

137
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
It's harder to convey than we think.

138
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I think I know what you mean.

139
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I don't think you should be so serious about your face.

140
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
But he's really angry.

141
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
If you don't make a serious face,

142
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
you'll be in trouble.

143
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
That's strange.

144
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I thought I was really good at acting.

145
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
When I got home, I was really tired.

146
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Then, in your mind...

147
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I'm really good at acting.

148
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I'm sorry.

149
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I'm sorry.

150
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Who are you?

151
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
If you say something like that...

152
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Yes, yes, yes.

153
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
You're so loud.

154
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I'm angry.

155
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
But it's a good excuse for Hamada to hit you.

156
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
But it's a good excuse for Hamada to hit you.

157
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
That's right.

158
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
If you hit me once, I'll hit you again.

159
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
What are you talking about?

160
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
If you hit me again, I'll hit you again.

161
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I see.

162
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
That's right.

163
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
That's right.

164
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I was really shocked when I heard that.

165
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I can't help it.

166
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I'm counting on you.

167
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I'm counting on you.

168
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I'm counting on you.

169
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I'm sorry.

170
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
It's okay.

171
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
It's okay?

172
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
In all these times he was alone.

173
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
He might have some things he didn't tell me.

174
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
When we got home, he said he couldn't tell me.

175
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
He couldn't tell me.

176
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
He said, that was true.

177
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
He said, that was true.

178
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
What?

179
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
What are you doing?

180
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
You want to say that again, don't you?

181
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:26,000
No, there are still things that are seen as wrong in a different way.

182
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Occasionally, many times a year, when I'm walking down the street,

183
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I'm told that I'm smaller than I look on TV.

184
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
You're the one who...

185
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
You're the one who made me look so big!

186
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
In your world!

187
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I can't do anything!

188
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,000
And all of a sudden, you say, I'm the tall Matsumoto.

189
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I'm the big Uri-no-matchan.

190
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I can't even put it into words.

191
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
You're the one who made me look so big!

192
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I'm told that I'm smaller than I look on TV.

193
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Ouch, ouch, ouch!

194
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
You're so annoying!

195
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
You!

196
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Wait, wait!

197
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Did you fall so much that you're dizzy?

198
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I'm going to slap you!

199
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Really!

200
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Thank you.

201
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Well, well, I've calmed down a bit.

202
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Then you should have said something.

203
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I've said something, so I've calmed down a bit.

204
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
No, I have to talk about something else.

205
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I have to talk about the match.

206
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Really?

207
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I'm going to give you the Kokoriko Yamazaki.

208
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
You're going to give it to me?

209
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I'm going to give it to you.

210
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Oh, I see.

211
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Please fight me.

212
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Four against one?

213
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Yes.

214
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
That's good.

215
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I've been thinking about it.

216
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
This game is very difficult.

217
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
You can play golf.

218
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
You can play golf, but...

219
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Well, well, well.

220
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I've played it twice.

221
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
100 meters.

222
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
What?

223
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
100 meters of the Tokyo-so.

224
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Tokyo-so?

225
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
100 meters of the Tokyo-so.

226
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
100 meters of the Tokyo-so.

227
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Yes.

228
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I'm going to run 100 meters on my own.

229
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
You guys are going to do it in relay.

230
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:36,000
In baton.

231
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Okay.

232
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Are you okay?

233
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Are you okay?

234
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
What?

235
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Are you okay?

236
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Are you okay?

237
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Wait a minute.

238
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
What does your picture mean?

239
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
It looks interesting.

240
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I don't know which one will win.

241
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Pretend?

242
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
It looks interesting.

243
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Look at me.

244
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
It looks interesting.

245
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
It looks interesting.

246
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Are you okay?

247
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
It looks interesting.

248
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Are you okay?

249
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
What are you doing?

250
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Wait a minute.

251
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
You can definitely win if you run alone.

252
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Right?

253
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Really?

254
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Really?

255
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
You can definitely win if you run alone.

256
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Wait a minute.

257
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Human beings are slow to start.

258
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
They gradually accelerate, don't they?

259
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
That's right.

260
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
It's easy to get in the middle.

261
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
That's right.

262
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
If you think about it...

263
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
You're free, aren't you?

264
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
That's right.

265
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
If you become free, I don't have to depend on anything.

266
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
It's okay.

267
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Really?

268
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Really?

269
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Look at me.

270
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Don't say anything.

271
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Look at me.

272
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Don't say anything.

273
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Don't say that you can win.

274
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
It's an interesting game.

275
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I have to do well.

276
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I have to do well.

277
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Should I do this with 100 or 200?

278
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Is that so?

279
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
100.

280
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
My secretary...

281
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Who is the secretary?

282
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Really?

283
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
You are the secretary.

284
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Yeah, you're always smiling.

285
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I'm telling you.

286
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
If you think about it normally, if you run 100 meters, you'll be able to run smoothly.

287
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
No, no, no, but I don't have the stamina you think I have.

288
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:48,000
The stamina you think I have is different from the stamina I really have.

289
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Well, that's what they say.

290
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
How is it?

291
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:01,000
But if you run with me, you ran a little before, right?

292
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
At that time, you were a little faster than me, right?

293
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Yes, yes.

294
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I can't see how much strength these three people, Endo, Tanaka, and Yamazaki have.

295
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
But I think Yamazaki is slow.

296
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
That kind of thing.

297
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Wait a minute. That's true.

298
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:24,000
If you think about it like that, it's a little tough.

299
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
25 meters.

300
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Are you guys okay?

301
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
We're not okay at all.

302
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Endo says he can win at all.

303
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Why can't you say that?

304
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Why can't you say that?

305
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Why do you look like that?

306
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I'm confident that I can win as another member.

307
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Endo is fast.

308
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I'm 6 seconds.

309
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
What is 6 seconds?

310
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
What do you do in 6 seconds?

311
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Close your eyes?

312
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
That's faster.

313
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Just like that.

314
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Oh, I see.

315
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I see.

316
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Tanaka, too.

317
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I don't think I can win.

318
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
He's very naive.

319
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Wait a minute.

320
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
100 meters is a little dangerous.

321
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
It's very subtle.

322
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Don't you think it's an obstacle?

323
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
What is an obstacle?

324
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
It's an obstacle race.

325
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
What's going on?

326
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Is there a hurdle or a rain?

327
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Stop it.

328
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I don't do rain.

329
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I just go through the rain and go over there.

330
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I don't care about the valley of the chest.

331
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I don't care about the valley of the chest.

332
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
What kind of clothes are you wearing?

333
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
The valley of the chest.

334
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Why do you wear clothes that are open?

335
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
That's a little...

336
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I understand.

337
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I understand your intention.

338
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I understand your intention.

339
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Let's think about it.

340
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Let's think about it.

341
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
We have to think about the penalty.

342
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
That's right.

343
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
There's something amazing about it.

344
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I'm already thinking about it.

345
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
By the way...

346
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I think I'm going to lose.

347
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I'm going to line up the four of us.

348
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I'm going to prepare a long bamboo skewer.

349
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I'm going to cut it like this.

350
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:33,000
And I'm going to catch it.

351
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I'm going to shake it a little.

352
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
It's funny.

353
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
If you catch it...

354
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I'm going to hold my breath for a long time.

355
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Why?

356
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Why are you holding your breath?

357
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I see.

358
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
It's really subtle.

359
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
You look like you're confident.

360
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I'm not going to lose to you tomorrow.

361
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I'm not going to lose to you.

362
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I have nothing to lose to you.

363
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I can do it.

364
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I'm definitely going to win.

365
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I'm definitely going to win.

366
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I'm really fast.

367
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Come on, you guys.

368
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I'm not going to write today.

369
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I'm definitely going to win.

370
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Tanaka.

371
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
On TV.

372
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
It was really subtle.

373
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
It's like this.

374
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
It's like this.

375
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
It's okay.

376
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Yamazaki, come here and do this.

377
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
The start is different.

378
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Ready, go.

379
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
It's slippery.

380
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Take it off.

381
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I'm not going to lose to you.

382
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Take it off.

383
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Take it off.

384
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
If you do it under your shoes, it's the same.

385
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
If you do it under your shoes, it's the same.

386
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Hurry up and do it.

387
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,000
This is long.

388
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Why are you doing that?

389
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Do it.

390
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Let's go.

391
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
On the count of three.

392
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Ready, go.

393
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
See?

394
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
It's the same.

395
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Take a look.

396
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I want to go to the third place.

397
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I want to go to the fourth place.

398
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,000
The start is wrong.

399
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Third place?

400
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Who's going to the top?

401
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
This is wrong.

402
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:08,000
It's longer than I thought.

403
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
It's harder than I thought.

404
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Tanaka, I have a compass.

405
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Try it.

406
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:25,000
See?

407
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I think I can earn a lot.

408
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:35,000
The problem is how to divide the four and one.

409
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:41,000
It's four and one.

410
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,000
What number are you trying to run?

411
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
You're not in.

412
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
It's different.

413
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:56,000
You can't run with five people.

414
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,000
You can't run with five people.

415
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I don't know why this is happening.

416
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
That's what happened.

417
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
This is okay.

418
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Why?

419
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
You said it first.

420
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
You said it first.

421
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,000
It was like this after the golf game.

422
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
It's strange.

423
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
It's in the order of the height of the line.

424
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:34,000
And...

425
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
And...

426
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
I saw it now.

427
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I don't know what to do with the order.

428
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I'll decide that.

429
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
I'll decide that.

430
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Why?

431
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
That's our strength.

432
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Please decide the meter.

433
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Five meters.

434
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I see.

435
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I'll decide that.

436
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Why?

437
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
That's our strength.

438
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Listen.

439
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
If you're okay with that, that's fine.

440
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Two, two, two.

441
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Twenty, twenty, twenty.

442
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
No, no.

443
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Two meters, two meters, two meters.

444
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
And then you run.

445
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
I don't have enough stamina.

446
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Two meters.

447
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I see.

448
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
I don't have enough stamina.

449
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:34,000
I don't have enough stamina.

450
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
You have to decide that.

451
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
I have to decide that.

452
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
There's nothing I can decide.

453
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
What?

454
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,000
You can decide costumes.

455
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
You can decide costumes.

456
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
I don't want to.

457
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
You can decide costumes.

458
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
I don't want to.

459
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Put me in there a little.

460
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
There's color of the baton.

461
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
You can decide the color of the baton.

462
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
I'll decide the color of the baton.

463
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
I don't care what color it is.

464
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Well, then.

465
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
You're going to say no if I say this.

466
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Green.

467
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Okay.

468
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
The green one is no good.

469
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
It's normal.

470
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
I wonder if there will be a lot of booing.

471
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I'll have to read the rules again.

472
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
How fast can you run at 100 meters?

473
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Honestly, at 100 meters.

474
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
The one you recently measured.

475
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
I don't know that.

476
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
The one you measured the most recently.

477
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
It's about 11 seconds.

478
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
11 seconds?

479
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
You're an Olympic athlete!

480
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
You're an Olympic athlete!

481
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Why are you running so fast?

482
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Why?

483
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Wait a minute.

484
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
How fast can you run?

485
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
But...

486
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
55...

487
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
It was about 7 seconds.

488
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
It was when I was in high school.

489
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
I ate a lot of dumplings.

490
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Has your running style changed?

491
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
It's still the same, right?

492
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
It's like Okamame.

493
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Your running style will definitely change.

494
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
You've seen it before, right?

495
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
No, no, no.

496
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
There's no way it will change.

497
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
No, no, no.

498
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
I'm just making the air my friend.

499
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
But Matsumoto-san...

500
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
You're training him, right?

501
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Yes, I'm training him.

502
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
He's amazing.

503
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
But, but, but...

504
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Honestly, when I see him running,

505
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
he's twice as fast as Hyo.

506
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Hyo is starting to look thin.

507
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
He's starting to look like Hyo from the front.

508
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
I don't understand what you're saying.

509
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
I don't understand this.

510
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
I understand that you're starting to look like Hyo,

511
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
but you're starting to look like him from the front.

512
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
That's right.

513
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
What do you mean, from the front?

514
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
That's right.

515
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
I really don't understand that.

516
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
I really can't say that.

517
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
No, no.

518
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
What was that?

519
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
No, no, no.

520
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
That was funny.

521
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
You don't have to say it.

522
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
I can't say that.

523
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
You don't have to say it.

524
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
I don't understand.

525
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
I don't understand what you're saying.

526
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
But, do you want to go with that?

527
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Let's go.

528
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
That's totally fine.

529
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
You want to go?

530
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
I'll decide.

531
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
I'm fine with doing it with bare hands.

532
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
That's my problem.

533
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
If you hold something, it'll be very difficult to do it.

534
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I really want to do it like this.

535
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Like this?

536
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Really.

537
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
With your hands?

538
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Like this?

539
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
How do you do it?

540
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
No, if I do this, it'll be very different.

541
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
With your hands?

542
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Yes.

543
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
I want to match left and right.

544
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Yes, yes.

545
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
What should I do?

546
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
If I can't hold it, I'll take two.

547
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
What if you take two?

548
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
If I take two, it'll be difficult to color it.

549
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
You can't do it with one hand.

550
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
You can do it with blue and blue.

551
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Blue and blue?

552
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Then you can do it with red.

553
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Why?

554
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Because there are many colors.

555
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
You can do it with blue.

556
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
