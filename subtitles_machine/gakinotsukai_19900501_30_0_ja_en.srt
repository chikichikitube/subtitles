1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Ladies and gentlemen.

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Today, we have a lot of things that we have to do.

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Listen to me!

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Normally, we go out for the opening.

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
What are we doing today?

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Are we in Nippori?

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
We are in Nippori.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
But we are not doing it today.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
We are not doing it.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Why?

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
There is something that you have to see today.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I said it at the beginning of this year.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
This year, we are going to participate in various programs with high ratings.

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Let's go normally.

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Let's go.

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Let's wake up from Amagasaki.

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
That's right.

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
The other day, I went to the audition for the costume of Kin-chan.

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
We did it together last year.

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
We don't know if we will pass or fail.

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
We don't know.

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
The staff doesn't know either.

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
But we brought it today.

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
So today, in front of everyone,

25
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
we will announce whether we will pass or fail.

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I don't think there is anyone who has been there.

27
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
It's a great atmosphere.

28
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
After all, it's serious.

29
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The father takes the child with him.

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
We are the same as the amateurs.

31
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
That's right.

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
That's where it starts.

33
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
When we change our clothes, the father is next to us.

34
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
That's a great atmosphere.

35
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
That was amazing.

36
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I was a little nervous.

37
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I was a little nervous.

38
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:53,000
When I came, the person who finished the audition gave me a lot of luggage.

39
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I took the child with me.

40
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I was a little nervous.

41
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
It was a great atmosphere.

42
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Everyone was painting their faces.

43
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
We did it.

44
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
We did it.

45
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
What will happen?

46
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I was very nervous.

47
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
It will be amazing if you get the main line.

48
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
It will be amazing if you get the main line.

49
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
It was amazing from the preliminary round.

50
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I was treated like an amateur.

51
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Number 67.

52
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Number 67.

53
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Matsumoto Hitoshi who was raised by Amagasaki.

54
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
It's not a phantom.

55
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
It's not a phantom.

56
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Matsumoto Hitoshi

57
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I think there is a root.

58
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:39,000
When we started, the judges were angry.

59
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
It was the last time.

60
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I had a face that seemed like it was angry.

61
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
When Hamada jumped out of the chameleon,

62
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:53,000
You hit me with your hand!

63
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
This is it!

64
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I made a face that said this is it.

65
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I see.

66
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
After this, I'll announce it.

67
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Yes.

68
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Masumoto Hitoshi-san is also wearing a hood.

69
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Yes.

70
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
You have to watch the V-app.

71
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I'll watch it.

72
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
But before that...

73
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Commercial!

74
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:20,000
No!

75
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:35,000
This program is brought to you by Sunlux.

76
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
That was a nice announcement from Momoya.

77
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
What are you talking about?

78
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
You're making me angry.

79
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
You look like you're good at pigeon fishing.

80
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
That's right.

81
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Yes.

82
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
In that case...

83
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Yes.

84
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
The other day, we...

85
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
On Nihon TV...

86
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
On the other channel...

87
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I was there early.

88
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
You were late.

89
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I wonder if you're in there properly.

90
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Yes.

91
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
You're in the rehearsal room.

92
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Yes.

93
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Let's watch it until you get the audition.

94
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Yes, please.

95
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
But this year, I'm going to do it for real.

96
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I'll be on the show.

97
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I'll apply like an amateur.

98
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
You have to apply.

99
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
You have to apply.

100
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
For example, what are you thinking about?

101
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I'm thinking about...

102
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
That...

103
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
That...

104
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
That...

105
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
That...

106
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
That...

107
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
That...

108
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
That...

109
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
That...

110
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
That...

111
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
That...

112
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
That...

113
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
That...

114
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
That...

115
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
That...

116
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
That...

117
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
That...

118
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
That...

119
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
That...

120
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
That...

121
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
That...

122
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
That...

123
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
That...

124
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
That...

125
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:49,640
D

126
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,160
I

127
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:56,160
This is a satin-like fabric, so it's hard to tell if it's good or not.

128
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,160
Look at the side.

129
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,160
Like this.

130
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,160
He's eating it now.

131
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,160
It's like this inside.

132
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:18,160
Even if you go like this,

133
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:23,160
if you look at this side, you can tell it's Kameleon.

134
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,160
Is this a gym?

135
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,160
Yes.

136
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:58,160
It's the hardest to tell if it's Kameleon or not.

137
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:19,160
It's hard to tell if it's Kameleon or not.

138
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:22,160
No, no, no.

139
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,160
I can't do this.

140
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,160
It's hard to tell if it's Kameleon or not.

141
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:32,160
Hey!

142
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,160
You ate it, didn't you?

143
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,160
Look at the front.

144
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,160
It's like this inside.

145
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:47,160
It's like this inside.

146
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:50,160
You can't do this at all.

147
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,160
It's hard to tell if it's Kameleon or not.

148
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,160
Look at the back.

149
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:05,160
It's hard to tell if it's Kameleon or not.

150
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:08,160
Are you going to quit or not?

151
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,160
What are you going to do?

152
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,160
Are you going to do it or not?

153
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,160
If you're going to do it, take this.

154
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,160
Take this.

155
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,160
What are you going to do?

156
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,160
I'm going to do it.

157
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,160
I'm going to do it.

158
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:24,160
I'm going to do it.

159
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:51,160
It's hard to tell if it's Kameleon or not.

160
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:54,160
Dad, are you done?

161
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,160
Are you done?

162
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,160
Yes, I'm done.

163
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,160
Let's meet at the main line.

164
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,160
Let's meet at the main line.

165
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:04,160
I'll do my best.

166
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,160
I'm not going to pay.

167
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:08,160
Who's going to pay?

168
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,160
Good evening.

169
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:15,160
Nice to meet you.

170
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:18,160
I'm from Amagasaki.

171
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:28,160
I'm number 67.

172
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,160
Number 67, Hitoshi Matsumoto.

173
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:35,160
The title is Kameleon.

174
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:56,160
He's lost his way.

175
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:10,160
Come on.

176
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:21,160
Thank you.

177
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,160
Thank you.

178
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:32,160
He's angry, he's angry.

179
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:36,160
What should I do at the main line?

180
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:43,160
To be honest, there's something exactly the same as this about 10 times.

181
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,160
What is it?

182
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,160
Exactly the same.

183
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:50,160
What should I do?

184
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:55,160
I don't know if it's funny or not.

185
00:09:55,160 --> 00:10:00,160
It's not very funny.

186
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,160
What's that?

187
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,160
A fly?

188
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:08,160
I don't know.

189
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,160
I don't think it needs to move.

190
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,160
It doesn't need to move.

191
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,160
It doesn't hurt, does it?

192
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,160
It doesn't hurt at the main line.

193
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:21,160
It's a little more fashionable costume.

194
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:23,160
The wings are attached here.

195
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:32,160
That's why we're going to make a million yen.

196
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:36,160
I've been in the theater for three days.

197
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:40,160
I skipped it.

198
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:46,160
Thank you very much.

199
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:52,160
Did you see that?

200
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,160
It was cold.

201
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:58,160
It was like a human being.

202
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,160
That's it.

203
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:02,160
I'm looking forward to the results.

204
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,160
I'm going to my next job.

205
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:12,160
Thank you very much.

206
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:29,160
I got lost in the way.

207
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:46,160
Come on.

208
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:53,160
Thank you very much.

209
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:56,160
This is the making.

210
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:01,160
Everyone was laughing, but it was really embarrassing.

211
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:04,160
What do you think of this?

212
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,160
What do you think?

213
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,160
No?

214
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,160
You're cold right now.

215
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,160
Shall we bring it?

216
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,160
Let's bring it.

217
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,160
I'm really nervous.

218
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:18,160
Please.

219
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,160
Thank you very much.

220
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,160
It's amazing.

221
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:23,160
It says Matsumoto Hitoshi.

222
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:27,160
That's right.

223
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:29,160
Everyone's excited.

224
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,160
Especially the staff.

225
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:37,160
If you really pass this, you'll be able to see it again.

226
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:41,160
Of course, you'll have to practice more.

227
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:46,160
I wonder how it will be.

228
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,160
I'm nervous.

229
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,160
Can I open it?

230
00:12:49,160 --> 00:13:09,160
I'm doing it with Matsumoto Hitoshi.

231
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:17,160
What?

232
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,160
You're the only one who can see it.

233
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:23,160
How do you get it out?

234
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,160
Wait a minute.

235
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:30,160
I brought a chameleon here today.

236
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,160
Let's get it out.

237
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,160
Let's get the chameleon out.

238
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:38,160
And then I'll come out.

239
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:46,160
I'll get it out at that time.

240
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:52,160
It's cute, isn't it?

241
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,160
That's what it was.

242
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:58,160
That's why when I went to the preliminary round the other day, the judges told me that I didn't have to spin it.

243
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,160
I don't have to move.

244
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:05,160
Let's get the chameleon out.

245
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,160
Let me see the inside.

246
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:10,160
The inside is like this.

247
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:15,160
It's like a poop helmet.

248
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:19,160
This is a mouth, so I'm going to poke this inside.

249
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:23,160
It's well made.

250
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:26,160
It's like this.

251
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:29,160
So, is it a pass or a fail?

252
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:32,160
Get inside.

253
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,160
Get out of here.

254
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:39,160
I'll get it out.

255
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:42,160
I can't stand it.

256
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,160
Let's see.

257
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:49,160
It's a pain in the ass.

258
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:53,160
If it's a fail, it's a chameleon.

259
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:56,160
I was wrong.

260
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,160
That's right.

261
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,160
Now, let's put the chameleon on.

262
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:05,160
I did my best.

263
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,160
What is this?

264
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,160
It's doubled.

265
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,160
It's doubled.

266
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,160
Don't peek.

267
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:17,160
It's a pain in the ass.

268
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,160
I don't like it.

269
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:23,160
So, we did our best.

270
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,160
We did our best.

271
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,160
What's the result?

272
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:27,160
The result is...

273
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:31,160
Where is it?

274
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:34,160
Where is it?

275
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,160
I can't find it.

276
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:47,160
So, you're saying that the chameleon is doubled and the chameleon is doubled.

277
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:50,160
I know that.

278
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:55,160
Hurry up.

279
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,160
Hurry up.

280
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,160
I'm going to announce it.

281
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,160
I'm going to announce it.

282
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:03,160
Where is it?

283
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:13,160
I'm going to announce it.

284
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:16,160
Why?

285
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:21,160
It's dirty.

286
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:25,160
Why?

287
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:27,160
It's dirty.

288
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,160
Why?

289
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:33,160
It's dirty.

290
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:36,160
What is the result?

291
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,160
It's doubled.

292
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,160
It's doubled.

293
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:42,160
It's doubled.

294
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,160
It's doubled.

295
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,160
It's doubled.

296
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:50,160
It's doubled.

297
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,160
I can't do it.

298
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:55,160
It's doubled.

299
00:16:55,160 --> 00:17:00,160
Please take a look at it!

300
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:04,160
I don't know why, but I wonder if this line came out or something.

301
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,160
Did you mess it up?

302
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,160
That's good too.

303
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,160
Well, that's about it.

304
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:15,160
Well, I think you all have it in your hearts, but it's all Hamada's fault.

305
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:18,160
What? Why?

306
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:21,160
I don't think there's such a bad tongue.

307
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:25,160
I told you, didn't I? It comes out in 0.5 seconds.

308
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,160
Can you do it?

309
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:31,160
Hey, hey, hey!

310
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:34,160
You're kidding me, aren't you?

311
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:38,160
Are you used to being lost on the road?

312
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,160
In other words, you can eat even those who are lost on the road.

313
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:44,160
I'm in this world of weak meat and strong food.

314
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,160
Don't say stupid things.

315
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,160
I don't care.

316
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,160
What should we do with the 31st episode?

317
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,160
I'll be on the 31st episode.

318
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:56,160
That's right.

319
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,160
Well, it's 9.

320
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,160
It's in the fall.

321
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,160
From today towards the fall.

322
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,160
Oh, from today?

323
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:07,160
That's right. Our leader is starting from today.

324
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:10,160
You look like a high school detective.

325
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,160
Of course.

326
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,160
I'll do it.

327
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,160
Do you want to do it?

328
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,160
Yeah.

329
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,160
What about next time?

330
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,160
It's a waste, isn't it?

331
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,160
It's a waste, isn't it?

332
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,160
Should I give this to you as a gift?

333
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:27,160
The guy who gave this to me did the same thing and won the championship.

334
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,160
Let's introduce the postcards.

335
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:31,160
I don't have much time today, so I can only do one or two.

336
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,160
Don't do that.

337
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,160
Oh, I see.

338
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,160
Let's go this way.

339
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:37,160
Takahashi from Tokyo.

340
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,160
Is this called Chikoto?

341
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,160
Yeah.

342
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,160
Don't you have a concert?

343
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:44,160
Don't you release the record anymore?

344
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,160
You've released two records so far, haven't you?

345
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:52,160
I can't have a concert, so I'm having a hard time.

346
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,160
You came to Tokyo in October this year.

347
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,160
Yeah.

348
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:57,160
If you can, let's have a concert in Tokyo.

349
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,160
Yeah.

350
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,160
That's what I'm saying.

351
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:02,160
I don't trust him, so I don't want to do it.

352
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,160
What are you talking about?

353
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,160
You're trying to lie.

354
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:10,160
I'm really trying my best, but you're lying.

355
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:14,160
Then why don't you do your best at the rehearsal?

356
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:18,160
When I had my first concert, I did my best at the rehearsal.

357
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:27,160
At the end of the show, the two of us cried because we were moved.

358
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:30,160
There are times like that.

359
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,160
We're just angry.

360
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,160
It was really good.

361
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:39,160
The audience was crying, and we were moved.

362
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,160
That's true.

363
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,160
We shook hands and hugged each other.

364
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:46,160
There are times like that.

365
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:49,160
At that time, I thought I was going to die.

366
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:52,160
When I was hugged by you.

367
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,160
The staff was crying.

368
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:58,160
When I came to the dressing room, I was still in a state where I couldn't cool down.

369
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,160
I was still in a state where my tears were still left.

370
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:03,160
The man who was crying until a while ago.

371
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,160
What do you think he did right after the concert?

372
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:10,160
He was pooping.

373
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:16,160
When I asked him where Hamada had gone, he said,

374
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:21,160
Puripuri.

375
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:30,160
I don't want to do a concert with a human being.

376
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:40,160
I was nervous, but when I was done, I was relieved.

377
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:45,160
That's not a lie.

378
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,160
I did my best.

379
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:53,160
Everyone was crying at the venue, and I was pooping in the back.

380
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:56,160
That's true.

381
00:20:56,160 --> 00:21:00,160
I think it's okay to hold a concert in Tokyo.

382
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:04,160
I don't know if I'll hold a concert in Tokyo this year.

383
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:07,160
If I hold a concert in Tokyo, I'll promote it again.

384
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:10,160
I would like everyone to come to Tokyo.

385
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:14,160
That's all for today.

386
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:21,160
What's going on?

387
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:24,160
I don't know what to say.

388
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:29,160
I don't know what to say.

389
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,160
Aoki.

390
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,160
Just one.

391
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:34,160
Do you know Aoki?

392
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,160
He's a professional golfer.

393
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:39,160
Let's play with Aoki.

394
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,160
Don't get angry.

395
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:43,160
After playing golf, I came to interview you.

396
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:46,160
I won the tournament.

397
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,160
I put it in.

398
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:50,160
I won.

399
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:53,160
Congratulations on winning.

400
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:55,160
Don't get angry.

401
00:21:55,160 --> 00:22:01,160
Thank you very much.

402
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:04,160
That's all for today.

403
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:07,160
That's too bad.

404
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:11,160
Did you know all the bad things about this concert?

405
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,160
Did you know?

406
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,160
I knew.

407
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,160
Next time is for sure.

408
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,160
Next time is for sure.

409
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:18,160
The 31st time.

410
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,160
I'll do my best.

411
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:23,160
Next time is for sure.

412
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,160
For sure?

413
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:26,160
You're a bad guy.

414
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:31,160
You're a bad guy.

415
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:34,160
I don't know how many times you've changed your mind.

416
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:38,160
So, there's someone who wants a chameleon.

417
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,160
Really?

418
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:42,160
Yes, number 67.

419
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:46,160
I'll write down the number of people who want it.

420
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,160
No.

421
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:50,160
The number of people who want a chameleon.

422
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,160
And number of people who want a helmet.

423
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:59,160
Write down the number of people who want it.

424
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:04,160
I'll write down the number of people who want it.

425
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:09,160
You should put your wings on that.

426
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:16,160
That's silly!

427
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:18,160
I wonder if I'll be able to fly.

428
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,160
What do you mean?

429
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:21,160
I'll be like, I'm lost.

430
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,160
A birdman.

431
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,160
I'm lost!

432
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,160
I'm having fun.

433
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,160
That's all for today.

434
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:30,160
This has been downtown.

435
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:36,160
Until next time, goodbye!

436
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:38,160
I'll be waiting for you tomorrow.

437
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:41,160
I'll be waiting for you tomorrow.
