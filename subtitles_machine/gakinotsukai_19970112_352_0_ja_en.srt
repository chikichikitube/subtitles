1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Today, we're going to lift our heavy back and challenge ourselves to move.

2
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
It's a difficult song, but it's called Memories of Love.

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Here it is.

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Normally, when you go to karaoke, when you play this song, this kind of image comes out.

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I can't do it.

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Here are the lyrics.

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I think this is the point.

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Yes, it's the joy of a beautiful life.

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
This part is going to change.

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Happy, happy.

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
From here.

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
The beginning of the change is like this.

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
It's like a dead tree.

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
When it comes to actors, it's this person.

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Here you go.

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Good morning.

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm so excited.

18
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
This is the best scene in the producer world.

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
You're an idiot.

20
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
You're an idiot.

21
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The theme is...

22
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I've been listening to Memories of Love for a long time.

23
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
The theme that comes to mind is...

24
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Thank you very much.

25
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
It's a mixture of men and women.

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
This isn't funny.

27
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
It's hard.

28
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
The other person hasn't decided yet.

29
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I'm holding the camera right now.

30
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
It's hard.

31
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I'll keep shooting.

32
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Let's start with the bed scene.

33
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Let's take a look at the first cut.

34
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
This is the first cut.

35
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I'm looking at the night view from the hotel window.

36
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
There's a back shot.

37
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
You can't see it at first.

38
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
It's like this.

39
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
A new partner.

40
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:39,000
This is good.

41
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
It's good.

42
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Suga, take a picture of Gaon.

43
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Okay.

44
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
It doesn't change much.

45
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Okay.

46
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
It's good.

47
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I can't do it if I'm doing it as a partner.

48
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I'm looking forward to the bed scene.

49
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
It's like this.

50
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I'm the only one in Shinjuku.

51
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
This town is mine.

52
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I see.

53
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
You should open your legs more.

54
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I'm sorry, but I can't see anything from the hospital.

55
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
If you hit this, you'll sell it.

56
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I'll do my best.

57
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Let's do it a little bit.

58
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Put your fingers up.

59
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
It's good.

60
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
It's good.

61
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Let's do this.

62
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Ready.

63
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Start.

64
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Suga, don't move.

65
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Cut.

66
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I don't know.

67
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
What do you want to do?

68
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Next is the shower scene.

69
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Ready.

70
00:04:45,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Start.

71
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Cut.

72
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Cut.

73
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Put your buttocks on your shoulders.

74
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Tell the pig to do it.

75
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I was told by Katsushi.

76
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Let's do a funny scene.

77
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Ready.

78
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Start.

79
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I want to kick you.

80
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I kicked him a lot.

81
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:54,000
There was an ad-lib.

82
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
That ad-lib was good.

83
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Let's do a scene where blood flows from the hip.

84
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Blood flows from the hip.

85
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
What's that?

86
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I've never used it before.

87
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I can't use it.

88
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Let's do it.

89
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Ready.

90
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Start.

91
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Cut.

92
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
That was good.

93
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I was stabbed.

94
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Let's do the last scene.

95
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
It's a pet scene.

96
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Look at me.

97
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Look at me.

98
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Look at me.

99
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Look at you.

100
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
You are not welcome.

101
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,000
It's difficult to decide.

102
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
What do you want to do?

103
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I want to go to Yonaoka.

104
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Let's start with Kameya.

105
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I don't like it.

106
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I don't like the lower mouth.

107
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Let's do it.

108
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Let's start from the feet.

109
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Ready.

110
00:07:37,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Cut.

111
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
That was good.

112
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Cut.

113
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I changed the scene.

114
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I see.

115
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I got it.

116
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
It's a little different.

117
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
It's a little different.

118
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Let's do it.

119
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Let's start from the feet.

120
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I don't like it.

121
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I don't like the lower mouth.

122
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Ready.

123
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Start.

124
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Let's start from the feet.

125
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I don't like the lower mouth.

126
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Cut.

127
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I changed the scene.

128
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I see.

129
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I got it.

130
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
It's a little different.

131
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
It's a little different.

132
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Let's do it.

133
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Let's start from the feet.

134
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I don't like it.

135
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I don't like the lower mouth.

136
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Cut.

137
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I changed the scene.

138
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I see.

139
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
It's a little different.

140
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Let's do it one more time.

141
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Horive.

142
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Horive.

143
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Really good.

144
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Really good that.

145
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Mr. Mado, this is awesome.

146
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Horive, your mistake is serious, right?

147
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
In the end, it was like this.

148
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Usada-chan was like this.

149
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Okay, okay.

150
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Good, good, good.

151
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Takao Yamaoka didn't like it a little, but this time...

152
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I'm serious.

153
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Both of them are low.

154
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
It's better to be manly.

155
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
It's better to be manly.

156
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:53,000
It's the same as usual.

157
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Is it normal?

158
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Yes, yes, yes.

159
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
This is wood and gold.

160
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
That's how I feel.

161
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Ready...

162
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Go!

163
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
A beautiful life...

164
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Ah, I'm getting into the refrain.

165
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,000
A beautiful life...

166
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
He's an idiot.

167
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
He's an idiot.

168
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:41,000
He's an idiot.

169
00:10:41,000 --> 00:11:09,000
愛の甘い名残にあなたは微睡む 天使のようなその微笑み 時は立ち止まる

170
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:36,000
窓に朝の光が優しく揺れ動き 貴方の髪をためらいがちに染めてゆく

171
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:47,000
美しい人生よ 限りない喜びを この胸のときめきを貴方に

172
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:59,000
この世に大切なのは 愛し合う事だってと 貴方を教えてくる

173
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:10,000
美しい人生よ 限りない喜びを この胸のときめきを貴方に

174
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:39,000
二人に視野を訪れて 星になる日が来ても 貴方と離れはしない

175
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:45,000
二人に視野を訪れて 星になる日が来ても 貴方と離れはしない

176
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:54,000
二人に視野を訪れて 星になる日が来ても 貴方と離れはしない

177
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:03,000
二人に視野を訪れて 星になる日が来ても 貴方と離れはしない

178
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:10,000
二人に視野を訪れて 星になる日が来ても 貴方と離れはしない

179
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:18,000
二人に視野を訪れて 星になる日が来ても 貴方と離れはしない

180
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:28,000
二人に視野を訪れて 星になる日が来ても 貴方と離れはしない

181
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:36,000
二人に視野を訪れて 星になる日が来ても 貴方と離れはしない

182
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:44,000
二人に視野を訪れて 星になる日が来ても 貴方と離れはしない

183
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:52,000
二人に視野を訪れて 星になる日が来ても 貴方と離れはしない

184
00:13:52,000 --> 00:14:00,000
二人に視野を訪れて 星になる日が来ても 貴方と離れはしない

185
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:08,000
二人に視野を訪れて 星になる日が来ても 貴方と離れはしない

186
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:16,000
二人に視野を訪れて 星になる日が来ても 貴方と離れはしない
