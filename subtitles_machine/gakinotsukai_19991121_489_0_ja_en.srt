1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,000
From now on, I, Yamazaki Hosei, will start a small-scale trial.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Prosecutors and lawyers, please enter the court.

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Now, the defendant, Yamazaki Hosei, please enter the court.

4
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm so happy.

5
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
What's with that attitude?

6
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Prosecutors, please read out your testimony.

7
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I, Yamazaki Hosei, have been a regular talent since the 2nd episode of this show.

8
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I've been a bad influence on the ratings, but I've contributed to the show and created a lot of laughs.

9
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I've found out that I'm causing a lot of trouble to the people because I'm a small-scale person.

10
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I, Yamazaki Hosei, will start a small-scale trial.

11
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Prosecutor Hamada, please read out your testimony.

12
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Last week, we had a meeting regarding this trial.

13
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I, Yamazaki Hosei, have been a regular talent since the 2nd episode of this show.

14
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I've been a bad influence on the ratings, but I've contributed to the show and created a lot of laughs.

15
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
What's with that attitude?

16
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I've found out that I'm causing a lot of trouble to the people because I'm a small-scale talent since the 2nd episode of this show.

17
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I, Yamazaki Hosei, have been a regular talent since the 2nd episode of this show.

18
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
What should we do next week?

19
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Matsumoto-san, we've been doing a lot of studio stuff lately. Why don't we do something with Yamazaki-san next week?

20
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Oh, that's a good idea.

21
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
But...

22
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I'm sorry. Actually, I have a sore rib, so I can't do anything with my body.

23
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
What? Really? You didn't do anything until now.

24
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
It hurt a lot, but I've been holding it in for a long time. So, next week...

25
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Is that so? Then, it can't be helped.

26
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I'm sorry. It was a careless mistake of mine.

27
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Yamazaki-san, who doesn't like physical things, does a lot of planning with all kinds of lies.

28
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Moreover, all of these lies are spread during the opening project.

29
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:43,000
This is a scene in a fight between Yamazaki Kokoriko and a young comedian.

30
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Yamazaki tries to show his veteranism in a fight with a young comedian, but...

31
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
It hurts! It hurts!

32
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Shinko! Shinko! Shinko!

33
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Shinko! Shinko!

34
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Shinko!

35
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Okay, let's do it again.

36
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Okay, let's do it again.

37
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Okay, let's do it again.

38
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Let's do it like this.

39
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
What?

40
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
What did you do?

41
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
It's a prank.

42
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
It's my fault.

43
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
It's my fault.

44
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
It's my fault.

45
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Really?

46
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
You're lying!

47
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
You're lying!

48
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Where?

49
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I don't remember.

50
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
What is it?

51
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I don't remember.

52
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I don't remember.

53
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I'm sorry.

54
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
You're lying!

55
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
You're lying!

56
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Okay, let's do it like this.

57
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
You're making a lot of small lies.

58
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I can't think of anything.

59
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Everyone will be relieved because you're lying.

60
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
But at that scene, you'll think,

61
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
What? I can't do it?

62
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
You'll think,

63
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
It's nothing.

64
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
It's a really small lie.

65
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
That's right.

66
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
At that time, it wasn't a lie.

67
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I really thought it was broken.

68
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
You should have told me.

69
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
It was really painful.

70
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
It was really painful.

71
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
It's not a big deal if it's broken.

72
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I've never broken it, so I don't know.

73
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Don't tell me!

74
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I don't know how it's broken.

75
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Tell me maybe.

76
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Tell me maybe it's broken.

77
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Well,

78
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
About that,

79
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
To be honest, a young man from Osaka asked me.

80
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I heard that he was really nervous.

81
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
He was nervous.

82
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
From my experience,

83
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
If a young man gets nervous in that way,

84
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
It's going to be a really scary thing.

85
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
If you work too hard,

86
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
It's possible that a middle-aged man like me will be killed.

87
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I know that.

88
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I know that.

89
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I know that.

90
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I know that.

91
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I have a strong sense of it.

92
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
If I don't let it go,

93
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I will be crushed.

94
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I made a decision like that.

95
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
That's why I told him that it was a lie.

96
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I admitted it.

97
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Other than that,

98
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
If there is anyone who has a lot of small lies.

99
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I don't think I'm going to say this.

100
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
When we were doing mahjong together,

101
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
For example, if Mr. Matsumoto calls you,

102
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
You want to play mahjong, right?

103
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I'm in Nagoya right now.

104
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I'm listening to that side by side.

105
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Wait a minute!

106
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Don't talk to me!

107
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
It's a fact.

108
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
It's true.

109
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Don't talk to me!

110
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Wait a minute.

111
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Say it twice.

112
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Don't talk to me!

113
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Wait a minute.

114
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Hikobu, what was that?

115
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
That's not good.

116
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Miyasako, that's not good.

117
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Tell me the meaning of that.

118
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
What do you mean that's not good?

119
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Don't say something that will drag the program down.

120
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
But it's not like this.

121
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Don't talk to me!

122
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Don't talk to me!

123
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
By the way, I've been told a couple of times in Nagoya.

124
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
That's not good.

125
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Don't talk to me!

126
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
This guy is annoying.

127
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
That's terrible.

128
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Even when I was playing golf, my fingers were broken.

129
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I couldn't play properly.

130
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
There's no way someone with broken fingers can play like that.

131
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
How about you?

132
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
No, it's broken.

133
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
It's broken.

134
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
It's a finger.

135
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
But it's a really amazing finger.

136
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Well, that was last September.

137
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Hamada-san, look at this.

138
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
What?

139
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
This.

140
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
What's that?

141
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
It's a little swollen, right?

142
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
It's a little swollen, right?

143
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I don't know.

144
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
What are you talking about?

145
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Is there anything else?

146
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I've been told a couple of times in Omiya.

147
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I see.

148
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
For example, when I was about to go out to eat,

149
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Tanaka-san said,

150
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I found a really good ramen restaurant.

151
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Really?

152
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I said, please let me go to that restaurant.

153
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
And I introduced that restaurant to Yamazaki-san.

154
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
That's not cool.

155
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
That's not cool.

156
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
That's not cool.

157
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Is there such a thing?

158
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
No.

159
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I didn't know the meaning of the word trauma.

160
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I told him about it.

161
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
He told me about it.

162
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
He said it was a trauma.

163
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
And he answered what I said in some kind of interview.

164
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Who is this guy?

165
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
What are you talking about?

166
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
The answer is what I said when I went to eat.

167
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Really?

168
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Yamazaki-san.

169
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
This story began a year ago.

170
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
The fourth episode of the Gakinosukai Alliance.

171
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
The Gakinosukai Tournament.

172
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Every year, the Gakinosukai Tournament is held in Kawaguchiko.

173
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Itoi Shigesato, Okuda Tamiyo, Eguchi Yosuke.

174
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Yamazaki can work with big names.

175
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:51,000
For Yamazaki, it was his favorite project that made him realize that he was a member of the Gakinosukai Alliance.

176
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
The event was held after the fishing competition last year.

177
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
It was late, but the location was completed.

178
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Good job.

179
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Yamazaki came to Aisha to go back to Tokyo.

180
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I had a lot of fun today.

181
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Tamiyo and Eguchi-chan had a lot of fun.

182
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Well, I had the most fun.

183
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Yamazaki was in a good mood.

184
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:29,000
When he entered the highway, he stepped on the accelerator.

185
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Let's go, my Benz.

186
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
At that time...

187
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Ah!

188
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I was caught.

189
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I was caught by the police.

190
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
What should I do?

191
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Yamazaki was depressed.

192
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Later, he was called to the police and was beaten up.

193
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I'm sorry.

194
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:09,000
And on the day of the fishing competition this year, Yamazaki went to Kawaguchiko with Matsumoto.

195
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Good morning.

196
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Sorry, Yamazaki.

197
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
What are you talking about?

198
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
It's okay.

199
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I'm looking forward to it.

200
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I'm going to fish.

201
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
It was the first fishing competition in a year.

202
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Yamazaki's tension was high from the beginning.

203
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
The car was going well.

204
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Yamazaki went to the president.

205
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I'm waiting for you.

206
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I'm not going to lose.

207
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
You're in a good mood.

208
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Yamazaki flew to the president.

209
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I remember.

210
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
What's wrong, Yamazaki?

211
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
What are you doing?

212
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Yamazaki suddenly hid his face while driving.

213
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Yamazaki is driving at a speed below the speed limit of 70 kilometers per hour.

214
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Actually, I was taken a picture by an office last year.

215
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
So I have to do this.

216
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
You can't be taken a picture even if you don't speed up.

217
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I'll be taken a picture.

218
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Get out of my way.

219
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I can't move.

220
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Get out of my way.

221
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I can't move.

222
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,000
After that, Yamazaki kept hiding his face until he left Kawaguchiko.

223
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I have a witness.

224
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Please.

225
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
It's almost the same.

226
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Actually, Yamazaki drove about 60 kilometers.

227
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
To be more precise, Yamazaki was riding a tanaka.

228
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Yamazaki was fine.

229
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,000
The office said it would be fine if the speed limit was 140 kilometers per hour.

230
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
But Yamazaki didn't move at all.

231
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
That means Yamazaki didn't believe what I said.

232
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
That means Yamazaki was angry with Yamazaki.

233
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I thought Yamazaki would be angry with Yamazaki.

234
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
But Yamazaki was taken a picture by the office again.

235
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Yamazaki was taken a picture by the office again.

236
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Do you have any comments?

237
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,000
First of all, when I was arrested for the first time, I was on the same boat with Matsumoto.

238
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Actually, that's right.

239
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
When you were killed, you were on the same boat with Matsumoto.

240
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
At that time, I was on the same boat with Matsumoto.

241
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Matsumoto was on the same boat with Matsumoto.

242
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
To be honest, I want Matsumoto to be on the same boat with Matsumoto.

243
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I went with Matsumoto to send Matsumoto.

244
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Why did you go with Hiroko?

245
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Why did you go with Hiroko?

246
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I've done a lot of other things.

247
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
When I was a student, I played a game of punishment.

248
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I hated it very much.

249
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
But I finally became a student.

250
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I was surprised at the next action.

251
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I bought a wig somewhere in the neighborhood.

252
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I took it to a hair salon and asked them to cut my hair.

253
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Why do you care so much about me?

254
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Is that so?

255
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Yes.

256
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:38,000
This is Yamazaki vs. Moriman.

257
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,000
This is the story of the first time they fought.

258
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,000
This is the first time Yamazaki vs. Moriman.

259
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:58,000
This is the story of the first time Yamazaki vs. Moriman.

260
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:05,000
This is the story of the first time Yamazaki vs. Moriman.

261
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I was defeated.

262
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
This is the story of the first time Yamazaki vs. Moriman.

263
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Good morning.

264
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Good morning, Yamazaki.

265
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Is Moriman in the game?

266
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Yes, he is.

267
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
There's something I'm worried about.

268
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
What is it?

269
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Even if Moriman says he's strong, he's a woman.

270
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
I'm sure I'll win.

271
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I don't think I'll lose no matter what I think.

272
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Is that so?

273
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I'll tell Moriman.

274
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Yamazaki went to Moriman's secret room to find out where he was confident.

275
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Hi.

276
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Good morning.

277
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Moriman and Yamazaki have almost never met before.

278
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
He's a little nervous about Moriman's appearance.

279
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I have a plan for today.

280
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
But if you don't come seriously, I'll be in trouble.

281
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Okay.

282
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
It's not fun if I think I'll win, is it?

283
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
It's not fun if I think I'll win, is it?

284
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Okay.

285
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Are you sure you're okay?

286
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
If you hold back, I won't forgive you.

287
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Do you understand?

288
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Yes, I understand.

289
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Then I'll leave it to you.

290
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Yes, thank you.

291
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Yamazaki thought he would win, so he had a big show.

292
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
But the real game was...

293
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Yamazaki's secret room

294
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Throw it, throw it.

295
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I saw it, I saw it, I saw it.

296
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Come on, come on.

297
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Yamazaki's secret room

298
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I'd like to hear from the witness about this incident.

299
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Is that okay?

300
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Yes, sir.

301
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Then witness, please.

302
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Help me.

303
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Hey, you.

304
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Hey, you in the courtroom.

305
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
You in the courtroom.

306
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Witness, witness.

307
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
You in the courtroom.

308
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
You in the courtroom.

309
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I said that twice.

310
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Witness, is that the same VTR?

311
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Yes, that's the same.

312
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:47,000
After the first attack, he came back to the dressing room.

313
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
After that, he said, are you going to go too far?

314
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
He said, come on.

315
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
He said, come on.

316
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
He said, are you going to go too far?

317
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
He said, come on.

318
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
He said, come on.

319
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
What?

320
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Well, I did try too hard.

321
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
No, no, no, no.

322
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
It's okay if you play the game.

323
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
It's okay if you win.

324
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Well, how should I put it?

325
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Do you have more fun?

326
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
What is this?

327
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
There are times when words and this don't match.

328
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,000
But, of course, I will lose in the ring.

329
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I admit that.

330
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I want you to play on my field.

331
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Where?

332
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
In the water.

333
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
What?

334
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
In the water.

335
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
What?

336
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,000
So, why is your field in the water?

337
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I have a very strong lung capacity.

338
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Ever since I was in elementary school, I've been playing on the brass band.

339
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
It's okay.

340
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I'll accept that challenge.

341
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Are you sure?

342
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Wow.

343
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Hey, hey, seriously.

344
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
This is your field.

345
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I want to say something.

346
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Today, too.

347
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Today, I came to the school with my seniors.

348
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I came in with a bad feeling about smoking.

349
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I had a surgery 10 days ago.

350
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
So, even if there is a battle, don't come here too much.

351
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Be careful.

352
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Let me say something about this.

353
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
I'm doing a TV show.

354
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I put Mr. Yamaguchi in there.

355
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Then, I took a break.

356
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
What do you mean you took a break?

357
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I had a surgery and my penis hurts.

358
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I want to take a break.

359
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Hey, you're funny.

360
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:13,000
In the past, Miyasako had to make a child laugh in a TV show.

361
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
What should I do?

362
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
It's hard to make a child laugh.

363
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Miyasako was very worried.

364
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
But in the actual show...

365
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Pussy, pussy.

366
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Pussy, pussy.

367
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:41,000
She made a child laugh and won a big prize.

368
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
The next day, the show was on air.

369
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Miyasako's joke was very popular.

370
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:53,000
After a few days, Miyasako was suddenly called by Yamasaki.

371
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
What is it, brother?

372
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:01,000
The joke you did on that show is funny.

373
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Really? I'm glad.

374
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Really, really.

375
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
That pussy, pussy.

376
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Thank you very much.

377
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
By the way...

378
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Give me that joke.

379
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Give me that joke.

380
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Give me that joke on TV.

381
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
I don't want to hear it.

382
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
I don't want to hear it.

383
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I don't want to hear it.

384
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Miyasako was confused by Yamasaki's joke.

385
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
But Yamasaki didn't take a step back.

386
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Then Miyasako saw something unbelievable.

387
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,000
What is this?

388
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Pussy, pussy.

389
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Yamasaki had already done Miyasako's joke on his regular show.

390
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Miyasako was shocked.

391
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Yamasaki's intention was to be forgiven before the joke was revealed.

392
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:08,000
After that, Miyasako hid this joke.

393
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Pussy, pussy.

394
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I'd like to hear the witness's testimony.

395
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Please explain.

396
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
He didn't put any color on the video.

397
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
It was the same as it was.

398
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
He said, give me a joke.

399
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,000
I don't want to hear it.

400
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
He turned on the video and went to the bathroom.

401
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
He was wondering what video he was filming.

402
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
He was doing it with his butt.

403
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
He was doing it with his butt.

404
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
He was doing it with his butt.

405
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
This is scary.

406
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
This is terrible.

407
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
You talk.

408
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
I'm talking.

409
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
I'm not talking.

410
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I'm talking all the time.

411
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I'm not talking all the time.

412
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:15,000
I'm not talking all the time.
