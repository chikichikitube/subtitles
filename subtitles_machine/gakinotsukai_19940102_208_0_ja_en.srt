00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
In the early of the new year, the staff gathered at Sugano Mege.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
What's going on?

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
You know, a while ago...

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Iai...

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
It's not Iai.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Shiragatori?

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I got a phone call from a client.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
He said my sword is a toy.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Don't say such a thing.

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Don't go that far.

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
This will be a problem.

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
This will be the last challenge.

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Komomi thinks this sword is a toy.

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
The other day, Machan asked me for this sword.

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
He said it's a lie.

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Even if it's not a hand, it's a toy.

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
So I talked to Machan the other day.

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
He didn't ask me to do it.

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
He said he would do it if I asked him to do it again.

20
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
He said he would do it?

21
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I prepared a sword for you.

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I said something good, so it's fine.

23
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Here you go.

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Thank you.

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
That's bad.

26
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
That's the end.

27
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
It's the end.

28
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
It's really bad.

29
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Thank you.

30
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Shogun Shogun

31
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Shogun Shogun

32
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Shogun Shogun

33
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Shogun Shogun

34
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Shogun Shogun

35
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
This.

36
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I've done this before.

37
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:13,000
But this is the most dangerous sword in the industry.

38
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
This is a good sword.

39
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:23,000
This is a good sword.

40
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
If I had been told before, I wouldn't have been able to do it.

41
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
But you don't have to do it twice.

42
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
If you do it twice, the rating will go up.

43
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I'm sorry.

44
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I succeeded in Masamune, but you don't understand it.

45
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
That's why I'm going to do it.

46
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I'm going to do it with Catherine.

47
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Is this Catherine?

48
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I'm writing a picture of Mr. Fuji.

49
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I'm writing a picture of Mr. Fuji.

50
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:11,000
This is also that.

51
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I'm sorry.

52
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I'm sorry.

53
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I'm sorry.

54
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I'm sorry.

55
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I'm sorry.

56
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I'm sorry.

57
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I'm sorry.

58
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I'm sorry.

59
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Don't cry.

60
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I hope the rating goes up.

61
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I'm sorry.

62
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I'm sorry.

63
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I'm sorry.

64
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I'm going to write a picture of me being mentally united.

65
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I'm going to write a picture of me being mentally united.

66
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I'm going to write a picture of me being mentally united.

67
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Are you going to do it?

68
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Let's do it.

69
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:35,000
It's better to quit.

70
00:04:35,000 --> 00:05:00,000
It's better to quit.

71
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Are you okay?

72
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:16,000
It's been an hour.

73
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Has the balance changed?

74
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Is your bangs okay?

75
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I can't see it.

76
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I can't see it.

77
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I can't see it.

78
00:05:44,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I can't see it.

79
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I can't see it.

80
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I can't see it.

81
00:06:43,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I can't see it.

82
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I can't see it.

83
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,000
The program will be closed at this time of the year, right?

84
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Congratulations on the opening of the program.

85
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
What day is it?

86
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
It's the second day.

87
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
It's the second day.

88
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
It's the second day of April.

89
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
You don't have to do this program on the second day.

90
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Why don't you do it properly?

91
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I don't think there's anything to do.

92
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Nittere?

93
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Nittere itself.

94
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
It's stupid.

95
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
The drama is also slippery.

96
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
It's a double line.

97
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
What is it?

98
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
It's a double line.

99
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I can't say that at all.

100
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
It's a double drama.

101
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I can't say that at all.

102
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I can't say that.

103
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I can't say that at all.

104
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Why!

105
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Don't pull it out.

106
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,500
No, no, it's not like that.

107
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:34,500
But this year, I wonder what kind of year it will be.

108
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,500
Ninety-four years.

109
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,500
That's right.

110
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,500
Are you out of your mind?

111
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,500
Why?

112
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,500
Why would I do that?

113
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:46,500
That's why the yakuza are being threatened with money.

114
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,500
They're being forced into it.

115
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,500
They're being forced into it.

116
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,500
No, what I'm saying is...

117
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:54,000
As for myself, I have a lot of work to do.

118
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I'm doing five books right now.

119
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,500
I sing five songs.

120
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:02,000
Each one of them is a pretty intense one, right?

121
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:08,000
And then, I hear that you're doing some kind of drama.

122
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I'll have you say it again.

123
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
You're out of your mind!

124
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
That's how it's connected.

125
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
That you're out of your mind.

126
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Are you in a lot of trouble?

127
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Then, if that's the case, tell me.

128
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I'll do something about it.

129
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Do you need money?

130
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
That's strange.

131
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
No, it's not like that.

132
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
There's no way I'm waiting for 2,000 yen.

133
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
That's strange.

134
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
If you're going to do that,

135
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
people will think that Matsumoto is having a lot of fun.

136
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
But I'm having a lot of trouble.

137
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
No, I'm doing it because I'm on vacation.

138
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I don't like what you're saying right now.

139
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
No, it's downtown.

140
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
That's too cool.

141
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
It's a commando.

142
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Why is it a commando?

143
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Why is it a commando?

144
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I'll crush your legs.

145
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Why are you silent?

146
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
No, I've heard it before.

147
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:22,000
It seems that the drama is good in many ways.

148
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Wait a minute.

149
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
What's good?

150
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
When you're doing variety shows, you don't meet people.

151
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
But there's a lot of drama.

152
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
It's not like that.

153
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Talk to me more.

154
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
This is a liar.

155
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
If you lie, you'll look like this.

156
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
It's normal.

157
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
The waiting time is long.

158
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Everyone, listen and go home.

159
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
What do you mean listen and go home?

160
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I think it's a lie today.

161
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Listen and go home.

162
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I don't like it if it's a lie.

163
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
There's a lot of waiting time in the drama.

164
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
If you say it's waiting for the sun,

165
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
the actress who cries until the next day...

166
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
What are you talking about?

167
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I'm touching your nipples right now.

168
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Actresses don't do that.

169
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
You're right.

170
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
When you watch a drama,

171
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
the actress is touching your nipples.

172
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Why?

173
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Don't think about it.

174
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Why?

175
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Idiot!

176
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
It's strange.

177
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
After the drama, they date and get married.

178
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Right?

179
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
That's different.

180
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
What are you talking about?

181
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
What do you call that?

182
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Actors and actresses are the same.

183
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I don't understand the difference between actors and actresses.

184
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Do you have a partner?

185
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I definitely have a partner.

186
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
What do you mean you have a partner?

187
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
What are you doing?

188
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I'm a man of body type.

189
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I'll tell you later.

190
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I'm not telling you.

191
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I'm just saying.

192
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I've been telling you.

193
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I'm not telling you.

194
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Whose nipples are you touching?

195
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
How many times have you done it?

196
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
About four times.

197
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Four times.

198
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
At least four times.

199
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I've only done it once in a drama.

200
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Did you hear that?

201
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I've only done it once in a drama.

202
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I've only done it once in a drama.

203
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Then do it more.

204
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Do it more.

205
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
If you're really doing it, then do it more.

206
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,000
How many times have you done it?

207
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
If you keep doing it, you can't stop.

208
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
As a man.

209
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
So you're holding it back?

210
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
So I can't do it.

211
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I can't have a partner.

212
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
When it comes to acting as a couple,

213
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
actresses tend to get involved.

214
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
They don't know the real world and the drama world.

215
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
You know it well.

216
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Yeah.

217
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
You're lucky.

218
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
You're lucky.

219
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
If I was doing my job now,

220
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I wouldn't end up with such a beautiful place.

221
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
No.

222
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I would have a good time with you.

223
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I would.

224
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I wouldn't have a good time with you.

225
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I'm serious.

226
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I would have a good time with you.

227
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I'm serious.

228
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I'm serious.

229
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
You're definitely going to come back here.

230
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
It's hard to talk here.

231
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Let's do it here.

232
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
But...

233
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,000
But what?

234
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
It's okay.

235
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
What?

236
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I want to change something this year.

237
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
What?

238
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
What do you want to change?

239
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
We were just chatting in the dressing room.

240
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
You know,

241
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Ryuichi Sakamoto came here the other day.

242
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Right here.

243
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
He said he likes this drama.

244
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
He's the world's Sakamoto.

245
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:21,000
He wrote a song for the world's Sakamoto.

246
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
You go wrong?

247
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Badly...

248
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
It's bad.

249
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
They lose to Japan.

250
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
They aim for the hit charts all over America.

251
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Then they win by themselves.

252
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
It'd be great if it sold in America, you know.

253
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,000
downtown doesn't work, so change your name when we go to America,

254
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
and you'll be called Countdown.

255
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
That'll be cool, and in Japan nothing's going to sell.

256
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
On the songs.

257
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Let's do it.

258
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Ryuichi Sakamoto's PRODUCE.

259
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Geisha Girl!

260
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Hey, look for a new partner only when you're singing

261
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
It's Geisha Girl, what are you going to do?

262
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
What's Geisha Girl? It's our name

263
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Is that so?

264
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Why is it Girl?

265
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Old man!

266
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
On the contrary, it's En!

267
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I'm sure you can do it

268
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I don't know

269
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
It's Geisha Girl's song, sing it!

270
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Why do you like that old lady's food so much?

271
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Like pufferfish, pork

272
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,000
If you can't find a new partner, I can try

273
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I really don't think about it

274
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
It depends on the type of fish

275
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
That's right

276
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
If that person can do it, I'll do it

277
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
First of all, I can listen to it

278
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Can you write it for me?

279
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:53,000
You know, you've been to a lot of Japanese artists

280
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
But you can't do it, right?

281
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Takadaka

282
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
That's our Geisha Girl

283
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
It's not decided yet!

284
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I'm still in downtown

285
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Geisha Girl is dangerous

286
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
No, no, no

287
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Oh my god

288
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
You didn't get it right

289
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
The market is different over there

290
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Market?

291
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
That's right

292
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
What is that?

293
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Do you sing in English?

294
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Yes, yes, yes

295
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Do you sing in English?

296
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Yes, yes, yes

297
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Somehow, somehow, Nutae

298
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
No, that

299
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
You can't leave Nutae here

300
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
The title is Nutae, isn't it?

301
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
This is...

302
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Let's do it with rap

303
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Hey!

304
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I don't have a thin skin

305
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I don't have a thin skin

306
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
You're biting me

307
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I can't do it

308
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Hey, you there

309
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
What is that?

310
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
What is that?

311
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Stop it! Stop it!

312
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Stop it!

313
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Once, Miho-kun

314
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
He asked me to come over to play

315
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
He asked you to come over to play?

316
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
He asked me how far is it

317
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
How many square meters

318
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
How many blocks is it?

319
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
1.5 square meters

320
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
How far is it?

321
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
That...

322
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Say it right away

323
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
If you say it by color, it's green

324
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
No, no, no

325
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
By width

326
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
If you say it by area

327
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
The color doesn't matter

328
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
If you say it by color, it's green

329
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I understand that

330
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
How wide is it?

331
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
If you say it by animal...

332
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
You say it by animal

333
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
If you say it by color, it's green

334
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
In the alphabet, it's Z

335
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Z, right?

336
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
How wide is it?

337
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Hey, you

338
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
What is it?

339
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
You're so noisy

340
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Say it right away

341
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
It's a curry flavor

342
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
No, no, no

343
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
It's not a flavor

344
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
If you say it by color, it's green

345
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
If you say it by area, it's curry

346
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
It's a curry flavor

347
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
If you say it by area, it's curry

348
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
If you say it by area, it's curry

349
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
If you say it by area, it's curry

350
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
If you say it by area, it's curry

351
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Of course

352
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Let's think of it as the biggest event of this year

353
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I see

354
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Everyone, I'll start writing

355
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I'll start writing

356
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Do ants get full when they eat ants?

357
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Of course

358
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
But it's like this

359
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
After eating one

360
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
If we see it, we'll know it's like this

361
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
The appearance is the same as the ants

362
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
In the end, I think

363
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
There is a habit of animals

364
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Basically, animals want to be sold

365
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
They want to become big

366
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
They think about eating ants

367
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Right?

368
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Yes

369
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Kirin's stupid joke

370
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
His neck is long

371
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Did he eat ants?

372
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
So he eats ants

373
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
But he doesn't really eat ants

374
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
He puts it in his mouth and eats it

375
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
After that, he eats it smoothly

376
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
He eats it smoothly

377
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
He eats it smoothly

378
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
This is the most

379
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
This is the most

380
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
He eats it smoothly

381
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
He eats it smoothly

382
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
He eats it smoothly

383
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
He eats it smoothly

384
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
He eats it smoothly

385
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
So what I want to say is

386
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Everyone doesn't become happy

387
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
It's annoying

388
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
The postcard

389
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
There is nothing good

390
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
If you open the fridge, there is only green onions and ginger

391
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
What do you want to do?

392
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I'm hungry, I'm hungry

393
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
What should I make?

394
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I don't know what to put out

395
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
In winter

396
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I often see people with red noses

397
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
What is a copy robot?

398
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
No

399
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I have a cold

400
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
I have a cold, so my nose is red

401
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
My nose is itchy

402
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,000
What does a copy robot mean?

403
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Wait a minute

404
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Am I mistaken?

405
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Of course

406
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Of course, Hama-chan

407
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Then what is it?

408
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Is there really a copy robot?

409
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
It's not like that

410
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
The reason why my nose is red is

411
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
That is

412
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Laser

413
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
It's one step ahead

414
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,000
I don't know what it is

415
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
I'm happy 20 years ago

416
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,000
I understand more and more

417
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
If you get a laser, you will be happy

418
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
In a sense, you will be happy

419
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Are you unhappy?

420
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
I am happy

421
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
When you are entangled with someone

422
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
When you think it would be nice if you got a laser

423
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Everyone has one or two

424
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
There are times when I am entangled

425
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
I am happy that I get a laser

426
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Does it have any power?

427
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Of course

428
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
It's not just coming out, is it?

429
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
It's not just coming out, it melts things

430
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
It erases things

431
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
It melts things?

432
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
It erases things?

433
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Yes

434
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Please let me hear more stories

435
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
And then

436
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:29,000
When this area was still in the middle of the night

437
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Do you know?

438
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Well, it's okay

439
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
You are happy, right?

440
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
When the laser comes out

441
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Isn't that 20 years ago?

442
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Yes

443
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
20 years is a long time

444
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
It's my adolescence

445
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Your adolescence

446
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Your acne has finally disappeared

447
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
That's right

448
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
In terms of society

449
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
I was finally recognized as an adult

450
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
You were recognized

451
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
You smoke

452
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
You drink

453
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
You shake your hands

454
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
You are recognized

455
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Yes

456
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
That 20 years

457
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Happiness

458
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
20 years ago

459
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Yes

460
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Okay, you graduated

461
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Thank you very much
