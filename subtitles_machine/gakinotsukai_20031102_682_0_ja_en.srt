1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
You've been wearing a suit for a long time, haven't you?

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Yes, I've been wearing a suit for a long time.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
You were like that last week, too.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Really?

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Yes.

6
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Why?

7
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Because I'm a talent.

8
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
If I don't wear a suit, I can't do it.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Should I talk?

10
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Yes.

11
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Let's talk more and more.

12
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Let's talk more and more.

13
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Let's talk more and more.

14
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Let's talk more and more.

15
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Let's talk more and more.

16
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Excuse me, I've got some information.

17
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I've found a place where I can get a lot of information.

18
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Let's go.

19
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
How can you find it?

20
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I've got some information.

21
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Tell me.

22
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Who told you?

23
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I can't tell you, but I've got some information.

24
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Who told you?

25
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
You can't tell me.

26
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I can't tell you.

27
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
That's it.

28
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
You don't want to play, do you?

29
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Tell me who it is.

30
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Who is it?

31
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
This program is brought to you by the following sponsors.

32
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
This is the worst location.

33
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Excuse me.

34
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
This is the worst location.

35
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
This is the worst location.

36
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Where should we go?

37
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Let's go.

38
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
This way.

39
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
This way.

40
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
This way.

41
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Where is this?

42
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Where is this?

43
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
You're not reacting.

44
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
This way.

45
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
That's why I can't do it.

46
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Is it here?

47
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Yes.

48
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
This is something.

49
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
What is it?

50
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I don't know.

51
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Let's do it.

52
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Let's do it.

53
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Let's look for it.

54
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
There must be something on the floor.

55
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Let's go.

56
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
What is it?

57
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
What is it?

58
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
It's a secret.

59
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
It's a secret.

60
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
What is it?

61
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
It's a golden half.

62
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Wait a minute.

63
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I know this.

64
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I know this.

65
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I know this.

66
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I know this.

67
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I know this.

68
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I know this.

69
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I know this.

70
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Who is this?

71
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
What is a golden half?

72
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I don't know what a golden half is.

73
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Is this a foreigner?

74
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Everyone has a half.

75
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
A half?

76
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
A golden half.

77
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
It's Eva.

78
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Eva?

79
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Eva?

80
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
No.

81
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Agnes Lambda?

82
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:24,000
It depends on the person.

83
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Wait a minute.

84
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
That's right.

85
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
That's right.

86
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
That's right.

87
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
That's right.

88
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
That's right.

89
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
That's right.

90
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
It's not nostalgic, is it?

91
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I only remember this part.

92
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
It's funny.

93
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I only know this part.

94
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Wait a minute.

95
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I think it will be in the show.

96
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I think it will be in the show.

97
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Wait a minute.

98
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Something came out.

99
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Something came out.

100
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
What is it?

101
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
What is this?

102
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
It's a book.

103
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
It's a book.

104
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
It's a book.

105
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
It's a book.

106
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
It's Yoshimi Iwasaki.

107
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
The cover.

108
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
It's you.

109
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
This is nostalgic.

110
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
This is Aki Mizusawa's book.

111
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I know this.

112
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I know this.

113
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
This is nostalgic.

114
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
This is Yoshiko Iwasaki.

115
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
This is nostalgic.

116
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
This is you.

117
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
This is you.

118
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I remember this picture.

119
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Really?

120
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Really?

121
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Really?

122
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Look at this.

123
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
This is amazing.

124
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Yoshiko Iwasaki.

125
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
This is cute.

126
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
This is it.

127
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
This is it.

128
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
This is it.

129
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
This is it.

130
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
This is it.

131
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
What is this?

132
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Lineback.

133
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
What is this?

134
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Not here.

135
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
It's nostalgic.

136
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
This is the only baseball player that I know.

137
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Linebackers of Linebacker.

138
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Linebackers.

139
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
You remember.

140
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Specone.

141
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Home run.

142
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
March.

143
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
March.

144
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
His name is Ma.

145
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Tom.

146
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Tom.

147
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Tom.

148
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Tom.

149
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Tom.

150
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Your name is Ma.

151
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Tom.

152
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
That's right.

153
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
That's why he won the championship.

154
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
That's right.

155
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Let's dig this up.

156
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
It's nostalgic.

157
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
It came out right away.

158
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
What is this?

159
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
This is still a record.

160
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Romantam?

161
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I know it.

162
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I don't even know Romantam.

163
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I don't even know Romantam.

164
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I think only I know it.

165
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I think only I know it.

166
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
It's Romantam.

167
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Did you put your heart into it?

168
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
It's not broken at all.

169
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Why did you throw it away?

170
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I'm not Japanese.

171
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I don't know if it was written.

172
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I don't know what kind of voice it was.

173
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Romantam.

174
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
There was a program called the Japan Championship.

175
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
There was a program called the Japan Championship.

176
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
There was a program called the Japan Championship.

177
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
There was a program called the Japan Championship.

178
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
You can become a professional if you practice it.

179
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I think that's where Yashiro Aki comes out.

180
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I think that's where Yashiro Aki comes out.

181
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
It's really hard to practice.

182
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Yashiro Aki is amazing.

183
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Romantam.

184
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I don't know the song at all.

185
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I don't know the song at all.

186
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I don't know a Thai singer yet.

187
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I don't know a Thai singer yet.

188
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
It's Indonesian style.

189
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
It's amazing.

190
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I know Romantam.

191
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I know Romantam.

192
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I don't know Romantam.

193
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I don't know a Thai singer yet.

194
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Where are you?

195
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
What...

196
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Video.

197
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I want to see it.

198
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
We take it here, so it's quite nostalgic.

199
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
It's been a long time since I've seen it.

200
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
It's been a long time.

201
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
There it is.

202
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Let's get bigger.

203
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Is it Marudai?

204
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
It's Marudai.

205
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
There it is.

206
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
It's been a long time.

207
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I know it's a commercial, but it's Marudai Hamburg.

208
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I forgot that.

209
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
What's coming out?

210
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
It's a good one.

211
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
What's that?

212
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
What's this?

213
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
It's a thing.

214
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
There it is.

215
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
There's something inside.

216
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
It's a pencil case.

217
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
It's from the Rokumen Pocket.

218
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
It's been a long time.

219
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I know what this is.

220
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
It's a key.

221
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
There it is.

222
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
This is probably from my generation.

223
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
This is from my generation.

224
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
There's a separate place to put the eraser.

225
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Put the eraser separately.

226
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
What's this?

227
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
This is...

228
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
You can use the back as well.

229
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
It's double.

230
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
You can put a ruler here.

231
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
What's this?

232
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
You can put the eraser again.

233
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
You can put a lot of them.

234
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
You can put the eraser inside.

235
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
There it is.

236
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
It's a calendar.

237
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
There's a calendar.

238
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
You don't know what this is?

239
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
It's from my generation.

240
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
This is a key.

241
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
You can't open it without this.

242
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
You can't open it.

243
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
You don't know what this is?

244
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
It's such a big key.

245
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I can't help it.

246
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I forgot about it when I was young.

247
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
It's been a long time.

248
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
It's been a long time.

249
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
What's this?

250
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
There it is.

251
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
It's from Ichi-ni.

252
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
There it is.

253
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
There it is.

254
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I don't know.

255
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
There it is.

256
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
There it is.

257
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I don't know.

258
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
It's from Ichi-ni.

259
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
It's from Kontarou.

260
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Who is it?

261
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
The author?

262
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Kontarou.

263
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
There it is.

264
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
It's from Ichi-ni.

265
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
It's from Ichi-ni.

266
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
It's from Ichi-ni.

267
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
You really don't know?

268
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
You don't know?

269
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:13,000
You've already read third volume.

270
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
You've already read third volume.

271
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
You've already read third volume.

272
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
It's still manga.

273
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
There it is!

274
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Toilet paper.

275
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
It's from Toilet.

276
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
This is a dream.

277
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
You don't know?

278
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
You don't know?

279
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I don't know.

280
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
What's your dream?

281
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I don't know.

282
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
It's from Torii Kazuyoshi.

283
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Torii Kazuyoshi.

284
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
You don't know?

285
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Not at all.

286
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I don't know.

287
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
What is Matanki?

288
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Do you know Mr. Tsunami?

289
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Who is Mr. Tsunami?

290
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Ichiro Otomo?

291
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I don't know.

292
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
What is this?

293
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Toilet paper.

294
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I'll play a video.

295
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Please.

296
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Let's go.

297
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Here it comes.

298
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
It's a video.

299
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
It's fun.

300
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
This is very old.

301
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
We are old.

302
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
What is this?

303
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I don't know.

304
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
This is a video.

305
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I don't like this commercial.

306
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I didn't know this.

307
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
This is more than me.

308
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Right?

309
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
This is about 50 years old.

310
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
This is a nostalgic video.

311
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Here it comes.

312
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
This is big.

313
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Wow.

314
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
This is very old.

315
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
A mustard bean.

316
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:16,000
This is a belt.

317
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
That is a car horn.

318
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
It was so simple.

319
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Oh, I got it.

320
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
This is nostalgic.

321
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Let's open it.

322
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
It's a little blurry, but it's very nostalgic.

323
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Look.

324
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I don't know.

325
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
It's a fishing line game.

326
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
It's a fishing line game.

327
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I don't know.

328
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Why don't you know the fishing line game?

329
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
This is nostalgic.

330
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
This is nostalgic.

331
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
You can play with this.

332
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
You can put your own ship on it.

333
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Please try it.

334
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I'll set the ball here.

335
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
This is the other ship.

336
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
This is the other ship.

337
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Look.

338
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
It's completely off.

339
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
It's a big explosion in each process.

340
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
It's funny.

341
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
It's impossible.

342
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
There's only one left.

343
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
What is this?

344
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
This is a video game.

345
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I got it.

346
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I got a video.

347
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
This is the last video.

348
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I got it.

349
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
This is a nostalgic video.

350
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I want to cry.

351
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
That's right.

352
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I want to cry.

353
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
This is nostalgic.

354
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
This is nostalgic.

355
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
This is nostalgic.

356
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
This is nostalgic.

357
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
This is nostalgic.

358
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Is this all over the country?

359
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Is this only in Kansai?

360
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
This is not only in Kansai.

361
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
People in Tokyo don't know this.

362
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
This is the most exciting video.

363
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
When I close my eyes, I remember.

364
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Everything I saw was fresh.

365
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
It was the youth of Haruka Sepiairo.

366
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
And I did my best to do everything.

367
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I did everything I could to do something stupid.

368
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
It was a youthful time that was blue and powerful.

369
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Time is slow.

370
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
But we have grown up.

371
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,000
The nostalgic people who bring back the sweet and sour memories of that time.

372
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Thank you.

373
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I will never forget it.

374
00:12:47,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Until the day we meet again.

375
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
It's very exciting.

376
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
There is a fool.

377
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I went to Tsutaya.

378
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Did you go to Tsutaya?

379
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I went to Tsutaya.

380
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I was choosing what to borrow.

381
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
There were two men.

382
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Look at this.

383
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I will definitely cry.

384
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I won't cry.

385
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Idiot.

386
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I will definitely cry.

387
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I will definitely cry.

388
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I won't cry.

389
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
You will definitely cry.

390
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
You will definitely cry.

391
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
You will definitely cry.

392
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Shut up.

393
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
You will definitely cry.

394
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Even if you say something different.

395
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
You will definitely cry.

396
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I won't cry.

397
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Idiot.

398
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Shut up.

399
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Idiot.

400
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
You were crying because you were tired.

401
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
You're such an idiot.

402
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Really.

403
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I went to the hot spring with my juniors.

404
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I'm such an idiot.

405
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
It was a hot spring.

406
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Everyone was in a yukata.

407
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Of course.

408
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
We had dinner in a yukata.

409
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
There was a hot spring bath.

410
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,000
The next day, we had breakfast.

411
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
We went to the hot spring.

412
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:46,000
We had breakfast in a yukata.

413
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000
What?

414
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I don't understand.

415
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I'm sorry.

416
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I don't understand.

417
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Everyone was having fun in a yukata.

418
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
It was in the morning.

419
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
It was reset in the morning.

420
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
In the morning?

421
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Wait a minute.

422
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
You went to the hot spring bath.

423
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
You changed into your uniform.

424
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
You said,

425
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I'm sorry.

426
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I don't understand.

427
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Why did you go to the yukata?

428
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I don't understand.

429
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I couldn't go to the yukata.

430
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I couldn't help it.

431
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I couldn't help it.

432
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I couldn't help it.

433
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
The food was so good.

434
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I'm getting old.

435
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
You should go there.

436
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I didn't say anything.

437
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
What did you say?

438
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I didn't say anything.

439
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Your juniors...

440
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
You didn't say anything.

441
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
You didn't say anything.

442
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I didn't say anything.

443
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
That's strange.

444
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I don't know if it's strange.

445
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
What are you doing?

446
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
When your juniors say something,

447
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
what are you doing?

448
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
What are you doing?

449
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:00,000
This is Ebisu's face.

450
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
That's strange.

451
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
What are you doing?

452
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Do you know that?

453
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Do you know that?

454
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
It's a high-speed train.

455
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
It's a central high-speed train.

456
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
You're driving a car, aren't you?

457
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
It's in front of the curve.

458
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
It's going fast.

459
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
It's not going too fast.

460
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,000
It's going fast.

461
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
It's a central high-speed tunnel.

462
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
That's strange.

463
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
What are you doing?

464
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Do you know that?

465
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
You're driving a car.

466
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:42,000
It's going fast.

467
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Do you know that?

468
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
That's amazing.

469
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Why didn't you say that?

470
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
That's probably because you're wearing a sleeping cap.

471
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Is that so?

472
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Yes.

473
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I think that's amazing.

474
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
You're a genius.

475
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Are you ready?

476
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Yes.

477
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Why did you say that?

478
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
That's amazing.

479
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
It's amazing.

480
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Why can't you be more impressed?

481
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Why?

482
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
You shouldn't let it go.

483
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
What are you talking about?

484
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:22,000
If we're driving a car, we'll know.

485
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
It's four wheels.

486
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
What's going on?

487
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Can I say that?

488
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
It's like Hayashiya's Sanpei.

489
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Why did you say that?

490
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
It's the same thing.

491
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
That's amazing.

492
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I get it.

493
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:57,000
This is a question for Matsumoto-san, an astronaut.

494
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Matsumoto-san has had sex with an astronaut.

495
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
How did you feel when you had sex with him?

496
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Did you feel good?

497
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Where did you meet him?

498
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
An astronaut?

499
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Yes.

500
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Harappa.

501
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Harappa?

502
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
A nameless Harappa.

503
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
He was in Harappa?

504
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
He was in Harappa.

505
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
He was taking a walk.

506
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
He was wearing a belt.

507
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
A dirty belt.

508
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Who's dirty?

509
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
He was a student.

510
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
That's a lie.

511
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
He was a university student.

512
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
That's enough.

513
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
He was wearing a belt.

514
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
He was wearing a belt?

515
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
And?

516
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
And then?

517
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
And then?

518
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:40,000
He was sticking out his tongue.

519
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
And then?

520
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
And then?

521
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
And then?

522
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
And then?

523
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
And then?

524
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
And then?

525
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
And then?

526
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Up a bit to the left.

527
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
All the way.

528
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:10,040
It would be nice if he walk

529
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:14,000
in front of me like he's telling me to show him to a friend.

530
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,120
How did you do it?

531
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,000
That's strange, too.

532
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
There are times when a flower blooms out of love.

533
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
So the other person is like...

534
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
And I'm like...

535
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
And Perumon is like...

536
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I didn't need that.

537
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
In short, it's sex in the head.

538
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Like, oh, so that's how it came to be.

539
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
How does it come to be?

540
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
If you look at it from the skin, it's just floating in the air.

541
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
What's going on in your head?

542
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
In my head, I'm like...

543
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
I took off my bra.

544
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I'm like, oh, so you came to take off your bra.

545
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I'm like, oh, you're rubbing it hard.

546
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
I'm like, oh, don't touch the left side.

547
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I'm like, oh, I touched the right side too.

548
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
I'm sweating all over.

549
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Oh, you're so nice.

550
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,000
You too.

551
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Do it more.

552
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Do it.

553
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I don't hate it.

554
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
I don't hate it.

555
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
He's a middle schooler.

556
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
When JR was still called the National Railway,

557
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,000
there was a question for Mr. Matsumoto, who was called the leader of the shadows.

558
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Yes, I was called that.

559
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
There is a rumor that the linear motor car,

560
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
which has been experimented with in Yamanashi for many years,

561
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
has not yet been practicalized.

562
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
There is a reason why people can't say.

563
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Do you know, Mr. Matsumoto?

564
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Why hasn't it been practicalized yet?

565
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
I've been doing it for decades.

566
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
That's what it is.

567
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
In short,

568
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
it's too fast.

569
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
It's possible to go fast.

570
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
I see.

571
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
It's going to be fast,

572
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
but I can't stand that speed.

573
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
You've come to understand that you can't stand it.

574
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
I can't stand it.

575
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
What can't I stand?

576
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
The window.

577
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
The window.

578
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
I'm going to ride it.

579
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Do it quickly.

580
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Do it quickly.

581
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
This will come off immediately.

582
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
What is that?

583
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Why is it so dirty?

584
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Is that a window?

585
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
I'm trying to get caught.

586
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
This is like this.

587
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
So,

588
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
do it quickly.

589
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Don't do it with your fingers.

590
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Do it quickly.

591
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Then you can't talk.

592
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
I can't do that.

593
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
It's like this next to me.

594
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,000
But the president is like this again.

595
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Why is it like this?

596
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
The window of the Imiyama Otaku

597
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
opens like this.

598
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
That's right.

599
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
That's amazing.

600
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
You have to think about it from there.

601
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
You can't open a window like this.

602
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
You can't open a window with a hook like this.

603
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Then how do you change it?

604
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
You can change the window to a normal Shinkansen.

605
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
You don't have to open the window.

606
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
You've done that before.

607
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
You have to open it.

608
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
That's strange.

609
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
You can do it like this.

610
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
You can do it like this.

611
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
You can do it like this.

612
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
You can do it like this.

613
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
You can do it like this.

614
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
You can do it like this.

615
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
What I said is...

616
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Coffee, tea,

617
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
and the Udon.

618
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
You don't know what it is.

619
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
You don't know what it is.

620
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
You can't open the window?

621
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
The linear motor car.

622
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
You can't open the window.

623
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
That's strange.

624
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Why?

625
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
How do you drive if you can't see anything?

626
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Where do you go?

627
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
You don't have a window.

628
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Which window can you break?

629
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
You can't break it.

630
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
You can't break it.

631
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Which window can you break?

632
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
The driver's seat.

633
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
What?

634
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
It's not what everyone thought.

635
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
It's not what everyone thought.

636
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Really?

637
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
You thought it was horizontal?

638
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
You thought it was horizontal?

639
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
It's horizontal.

640
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
The front is like this.

641
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
The front is like this.

642
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
The driver's seat is in the back.

643
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
The driver's seat is in the back.

644
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
You have to open it.

645
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
You have to open it.

646
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Can I have it in the back?

647
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Can I have it in the back?

648
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
I put two in.

649
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
I don't have to open it.

650
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
I don't have to open it.

651
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
It's amazing.

652
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
The curtain is like this.

653
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
The race is like this.

654
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
It's amazing.

655
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
It's amazing.

656
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,000
This program was brought to you by five sponsors.
