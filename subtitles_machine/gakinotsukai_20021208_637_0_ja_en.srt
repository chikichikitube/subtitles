1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
You're angry, aren't you?

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I'm not angry at all.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Is there anything you want to say?

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Who is it?

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
There's a lot I want to say.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
When I first came out, I was wondering why the audience didn't say I was cute.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
You weren't?

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
There was something I had to say.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
That was, Machan is cute?

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I don't have anything to say about Machan being cute. I've already changed my mind about it.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:46,000
This program is brought to you by the following sponsors.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:14,000
It's starting again today.

13
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
It's amazing. Machan is so cute.

14
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
It's all over the place.

15
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Well, I want to say something I've already figured out.

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Speak! You have to say something you've already figured out.

17
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Well, how many weeks ago was it?

18
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
In my car...

19
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I don't know.

20
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Ah, the scratch?

21
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
It wasn't a scratch.

22
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
You told me that you had a nail stuck in your car.

23
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Yes, I did.

24
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
You did, didn't you?

25
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I didn't want to say it, but it happened again.

26
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,000
This time it was a strange way of sticking, so I bought a tire.

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
It cost 40,000 yen.

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Please.

29
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Why me?

30
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
You did it from the side.

31
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Who did it?

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
It was Jaguar.

33
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
You had a nail stuck in Jaguar's foot.

34
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
You must be proud of it.

35
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I did it from Yuta.

36
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Oh, come on.

37
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
A human being did it.

38
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Is that so?

39
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
He's telling me to do it again.

40
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Is that so?

41
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
He's telling me to do it from the side.

42
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
He's telling me to do it from the side.

43
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
That's for sure.

44
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
That's right.

45
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I'm scared to do it.

46
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Why?

47
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
You have your car.

48
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
You look like a fool!

49
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
You look like a fool who can't drive!

50
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I don't know what to do.

51
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
It's okay because I'm here.

52
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
It's okay because I'm here.

53
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Here is more dangerous.

54
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
This is more dangerous.

55
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I really can't do it.

56
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
What is this?

57
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Can I do it?

58
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
What do you mean by scary?

59
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I'm going to do it.

60
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Something spiritual?

61
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
No, it's not something spiritual.

62
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Oh, then it's fine.

63
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
And it seems that the person himself said it, right?

64
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,500
Yes.

65
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,000
That ******, right?

66
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Yes, yes, it's me, it's me.

67
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
That person's story is really scary, right?

68
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Yes.

69
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
The other day, I heard it because it was now,

70
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
and I was like, wow!

71
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

72
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I really want to say this.

73
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
If you hear it, you'll really want to say it.

74
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
If you hear it today, when you go home,

75
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
your friends will really want to say it.

76
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Because when you hear it, everyone will be like, wow!

77
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Really?

78
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
It's a true story.

79
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Really?

80
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
It's not a story from the past.

81
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Then tell me.

82
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Well, I was tired from work.

83
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Don't suddenly say, wow!

84
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
No, it's not like that.

85
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
It's like, it's you!

86
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
No, it's not such a childish story.

87
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
If it's like that, I'll be like, wow!

88
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
If it's like that, I won't say it.

89
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Well, I was really tired from work, and it was comfortable.

90
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
And it was a mansion.

91
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
The elevator in the mansion was open, so I thought I'd get on.

92
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
A man with a hat over his head,

93
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
he was like this, trying not to show his face.

94
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I see.

95
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I thought it was disgusting.

96
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
But it can't be helped.

97
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
So I got on and said, good evening,

98
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
but it was like this.

99
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
And then it opened in the middle,

100
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
and he went down.

101
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
At that time, it hit him,

102
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
so I said, I'm sorry.

103
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I ignored that,

104
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
and I went out like this, trying not to show my face.

105
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I thought there was a weird guy.

106
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I went back to my room.

107
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
After I calmed down a little, I looked around,

108
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
and there was blood on the place where it hit me.

109
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I see.

110
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I thought, what is it?

111
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I thought it was disgusting.

112
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
And then a few days later,

113
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
when I got home, I heard a sound,

114
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
so I looked at it.

115
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
A policeman was standing,

116
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
and he said, I'm sorry.

117
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Actually, a few days ago,

118
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
there was a murder at the police station.

119
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Didn't you see a suspicious person?

120
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I see.

121
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
He said that.

122
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
He said that, but he was really busy with the drama,

123
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
and when I saw him,

124
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
he said something about the situation.

125
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
It's hard, isn't it?

126
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
So I said, I don't know.

127
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Then he said nothing.

128
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I said, really?

129
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
And then the next day,

130
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I turned on the TV,

131
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
and there was news that there was a murder at the police station.

132
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
At the police station.

133
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Oh, really.

134
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
That's what I thought.

135
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
The criminal was arrested.

136
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
And the criminal's face picture came out.

137
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
When I saw that face,

138
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
it was the policeman.

139
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
No!

140
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
It's your will, isn't it?

141
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
But this is scary, isn't it?

142
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
This is scary!

143
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Why did you come?

144
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I came to kill, that's why.

145
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Is that what it means?

146
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
That's right.

147
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
When I opened the door,

148
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I was killed.

149
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Oh, I see.

150
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
It's really scary, isn't it?

151
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
But when I heard this,

152
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I really wanted to tell someone.

153
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Normally,

154
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I have a scary story now,

155
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
so I can't do it normally.

156
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
This is scary.

157
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Oh, I see.

158
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
So I had to open the door,

159
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
and it was really good.

160
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I see.

161
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Actually, that's right.

162
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I saw it.

163
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
It would have been dangerous

164
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
if I had told you to wear a hat like this.

165
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I'm completely mouth-closed.

166
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
But you're supposed to open it.

167
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I'll open it.

168
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I'll open it.

169
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
It's the story of the other day.

170
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
It's scary.

171
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Living alone is scary.

172
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Well, it's scary even if you're not alone.

173
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I was taking a shower,

174
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
and when I came out,

175
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
my body was wet,

176
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
and I heard a noise.

177
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
A security guard came in,

178
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
and he was about to come.

179
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Who are you?

180
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I said, who are you?

181
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
And he was a security guard.

182
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
You said his name.

183
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
That's right.

184
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
There was a water leak,

185
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
so I called him,

186
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
but he didn't answer,

187
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
so I said I wanted to see him.

188
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
And he looked at me.

189
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I thought he was looking at me.

190
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I think it was this way.

191
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Either way.

192
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I think it was this way.

193
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
You can't do that anymore.

194
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
You can't do that anymore.

195
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
But in that case,

196
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
you can sign the contract.

197
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
You can sign it.

198
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
You can see it.

199
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
It's really scary.

200
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
If you have one security guard,

201
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
you can't open it.

202
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
There are usually two security guards.

203
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Yes, usually.

204
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Even in the inspection.

205
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
That's right.

206
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
You can't break it if there are two.

207
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Right?

208
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Don't think it's a lie.

209
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Yes, yes.

210
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
But it's like a patrol card,

211
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
with only one person.

212
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I have that one as well.

213
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
But if you look at it from here,

214
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
it's a patrol card.

215
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
You can't do that.

216
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
It's a security guard.

217
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
It's a security guard from the neighborhood.

218
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
In general,

219
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
there should be a person who knows.

220
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
It's scary.

221
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
It's really scary.

222
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
It's okay.

223
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
You can shout again,

224
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
if you say so.

225
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
You can shout.

226
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Even if you say it, you won't be able to do it, right?

227
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
If it was you, you'd probably stop like this, right?

228
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Yeah, like this.

229
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Even if you do this, you'd probably do this.

230
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
You came to the bozap, right?

231
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
You saw a lot of things, right?

232
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
You can win, right?

233
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I can win?

234
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I'm confused.

235
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
If you go too far, it's like this.

236
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
It's like this.

237
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
It's like this.

238
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
It's like this.

239
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
There seems to be something today, right?

240
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
That's right.

241
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Let's all read it.

242
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Hurry up and get out of here!

243
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Endo-kun and I did it!

244
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:21,000
What kind of name should I give to the child that will be born?

245
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
The program?

246
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I asked a specialist teacher to see it.

247
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Really?

248
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Yes.

249
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Would you like to see it?

250
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Yes.

251
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
This time, congratulations to Ms. Chiaki.

252
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
So, for the baby who is expected to be born in May next year,

253
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I asked Mr. Junichiro Yamaguchi, the first person of life science.

254
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
First of all, both of you are from the planet of hell.

255
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I think that the planet of hell is probably a simple person who does not suit entertainers.

256
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:02,000
In other words, Mr. Endo is a very serious person and has a very strong personality.

257
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
So, he's not the kind of person who does a lot of things in a combination.

258
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
So, he's not good at comedy.

259
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I think he's the kind of person who does things like a student or an engineer.

260
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,000
And I think his wife is a very smart person.

261
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:29,000
She hates nonsense, hates lies, and is very serious, so she helps her husband very much.

262
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:36,000
So, when I look at this, I think this husband, this father, got a very good god.

263
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I think it will be a good family.

264
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
What do you mean father?

265
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
What if it's a boy?

266
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
The name Mr. Endo is 17 years old and 21 years old.

267
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
He's 38 years old just by his last name.

268
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:55,000
If you add his last name, he's already 50 or 60 years old, and he doesn't have a good last name at all.

269
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I've been doing this for 40 years, so I don't know.

270
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
It's a very difficult name.

271
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
So, Mr. Endo is only 63 years old.

272
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,000
His last name is Yoshiteru, or Yoshikito.

273
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
The name Yoshiteru is the best.

274
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
All of them are 63 years old and have a good last name.

275
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Mr. Yoshiteru and Mr. Yoshikito have a good last name of 35 years old.

276
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:24,000
This name is a good name for Mr. Endo.

277
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Next, by chance, the current Prime Minister is Junichiro.

278
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Junichiro is surprised by his athleticism, so his name is Pittanko.

279
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
All of them are 63 years old.

280
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Junichiro is 25 years old.

281
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
He's very lucky because he's young.

282
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
That's why it was important.

283
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
First of all, when the eldest son is born, everyone is Ichiro.

284
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Ichiro and Taro are the eldest sons, so I think this name is Pittanko.

285
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
What if it's a girl?

286
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
It's very difficult for a girl to have a name.

287
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Uedake is 38 years old.

288
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:10,000
This name, Yurika, is a perfect name.

289
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
63 years old is very lucky.

290
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Yurika is lucky to be married at the age of 35.

291
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,000
The middle one is lucky to be middle-aged.

292
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
The environment around it is good.

293
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
It's good for money and health.

294
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I think this name is the best.

295
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
It's amazing.

296
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
It's a good name even if it's old.

297
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
It's a good name even if it's old.

298
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Junichiro.

299
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Junichiro.

300
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Yurika.

301
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
It's up to you.

302
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
What?

303
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
If it's a girl, it's this.

304
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
If it's a boy, it's this.

305
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Let's go with Junichiro.

306
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
The name is so easy.

307
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
It's okay.

308
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Let's go with Junichiro.

309
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
It's okay for a boy or a girl.

310
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
It's okay for a boy or a girl.

311
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Let's go with Junichiro.

312
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
It's a bad name.

313
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Let's go with Junichiro.

314
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Let's go home and ask my wife.

315
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I'll give you this.

316
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Really?

317
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
You can take this.

318
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I'll definitely take this.

319
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
If you take this, it's the end.

320
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
It's the end.

321
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
You haven't thought of anything yet?

322
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I haven't thought of anything yet.

323
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
If it's like this, it's only Tanaka and me.

324
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
That's right.

325
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
That's right.

326
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Eh?

327
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
That's right.

328
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
What are you doing?

329
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I just want to say something.

330
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
By the way,

331
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Other than Endo,

332
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
We also want to see your fortune for next year.

333
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Eh?

334
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
It's from me.

335
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
This person,

336
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
From his name,

337
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
He is very precious and stubborn.

338
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
If you think like this,

339
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Even if the person in front of you says,

340
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
He is a person who passes through his beliefs.

341
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
So, I think it would be nice to make it a little softer

342
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I think it would be nice to make it a little softer

343
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I think it would be nice to make it a little softer

344
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
After that,

345
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
If you want to see your fortune for next year,

346
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
If you want to see your fortune for next year,

347
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I want to see your fortune for next year.

348
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
From December 2012,

349
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
To February 2016,

350
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
The fortune is very strong.

351
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
In particular, next year,

352
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
It is the strongest year of the best fortune in the past 10 years.

353
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
It is the strongest year of the best fortune in the past 10 years.

354
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
If you do it a lot,

355
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
16 years will be a little bit of a slump in a year.

356
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
If you do it without a slump,

357
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
It will be perfect.

358
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
With a little kindness,

359
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
If you listen to what people say,

360
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
If you listen to what people say,

361
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
It is the strongest year of the best fortune in the past 10 years.

362
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
This person has a total of 33 names.

363
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
It is the strongest year of the best fortune in the past 10 years.

364
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
This person has a total of 33 names.

365
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Mr. Konda Soichiro also has 33 names.

366
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Because he has a strong name

367
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I want you to expect a lot from him.

368
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
But, there is a number 12 in the middle of the name.

369
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
This number 12 is a very bad case of interpersonal relationships.

370
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
This number 12 is a very bad case of interpersonal relationships.

371
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
So,

372
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
If you look at it from a person's point of view,

373
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
It is the strongest year of the best fortune in the past 10 years.

374
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
It is the strongest year of the best fortune in the past 10 years.

375
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
It is the same hell as Mr. Endo.

376
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Hell is good for the past 3 years.

377
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Hell is good for the past 3 years.

378
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
This year is the best year.

379
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
This year is the best year.

380
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Next year is probably a new first step.

381
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
If you do it carefully at that time,

382
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
It will be better for the next year to 4 years.

383
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Next year, be careful.

384
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
I will be a person who has a lot of potential.

385
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
His face is the best in his life in my opinion.

386
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
His face is the best in his life in my opinion.

387
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
His name is 31,

388
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
and he has been blessed with wealth and work for his whole life.

389
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
His name is Saki,

390
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
and his 23rd month is the best name of all men.

391
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
and his 23rd month is the best name of all men.

392
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
His name is Saki,

393
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,000
He is always encouraged by the people around him.

394
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
He is perfect.

395
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
He has been doing well for the past 3 years.

396
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Next year, he will be the best in the last 10 years.

397
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I think he will grow a lot next year.

398
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Oh, he is going.

399
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Mr. Masumoto has a very different personality from the general public.

400
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
He is charismatic.

401
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
He has a strong mindset.

402
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
His luck is very good.

403
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Next year, he will be the best in the last 10 years.

404
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
He is the first-place Mercury.

405
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
The first-place Mercury is the midsummer.

406
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Next year will be a bit more difficult.

407
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:59,000
By working hard at the time of the strong star of next year, the next year's fortune will be better.

408
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I'm going to be 40 years old this time, but I'm not married yet.

409
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I'd like to hear from you in the future.

410
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I'm still young when I say I'm 40 years old, but if I don't get married, my partner will know right away.

411
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:26,000
So I think it's better to meet someone who is older than you.

412
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Even if you're 13 or 15 years old, or 20 years old, I think you'll get along well with that kind of person.

413
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,000
My husband is gone now, but he's kind to me.

414
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,000
A person who can make a husband is a kind person.

415
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I think you have to choose such a person.

416
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:53,000
If you get married, it'll be the best time of the year.

417
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Congratulations!

418
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I'm looking forward to it.

419
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,000
What do you think? Do you think he's right?

420
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,000
When I'm talking, I hear the sound of a motorcycle.

421
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Mr. Yamada is perfect.

422
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
I'm working more and more.

423
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
You said you'd grow next year.

424
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,000
My work is getting less and less.

425
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
It's true.

426
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,000
We're the same all the time.

427
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I have a feeling that I'm going to grow from next year.

428
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Why?

429
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I don't know why, but I have a feeling.

430
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I'm sleepy.

431
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I don't know if we can talk about this right now.

432
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I have a feeling.

433
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
A feeling?

434
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I have a feeling.

435
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I'm just saying it over and over again.

436
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I'm just saying I have a feeling.

437
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I really have a feeling.

438
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Please do your best.

439
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
What's your name?

440
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Can I call you Mr. Matsumoto?

441
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I'm going to be born in May.

442
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Before that, please tell me your name.

443
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I'm Luke Panchama.

444
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I'm Luke Panchama.

445
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I want you to be strong.

446
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I'm Luke Panchama.

447
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
I'm Luke Panchama.

448
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I want you to take care of me for the rest of my life.

449
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Thank you.

450
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Please give this to Hanagawa-san.

451
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Thank you.

452
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I'll take it.

453
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
If you're born, I'll give it to you.

454
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
That's right.

455
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
You're going to give it to Endo, too?

456
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
I'll give it to him.

457
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Really? Can you promise me now?

458
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Why are you using standard Japanese?

459
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
If you're born, I'll give it to you.

460
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Can I tell you a really bad story about my wedding?

461
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Mr. Matsumoto gave it to me.

462
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Mr. Yamada also gave it to me.

463
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
These two haven't given it to me yet.

464
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Why didn't you give it to me?

465
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Especially Hamada-san.

466
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I'm still a little nervous.

467
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
It doesn't matter.

468
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
It's hard to get it.

469
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
I want to see if I can give it to you.

470
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
When did you give it to him?

471
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I gave it to all of them.

472
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
What do you mean, all of them?

473
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
The other day, Mr. Komuro came to Hajima.

474
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
It was downtown.

475
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
He gave me 500,000 yen.

476
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
That's a lot.

477
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
He asked me if 250,000 yen was okay.

478
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,000
I was driving, and I said, okay.

479
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Why am I the same age as him?

480
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
You have a lot of debt to Mr. Komuro.

481
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
I see.

482
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
That's right.

483
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,000
50,045,000 yen.

484
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Don't say such a bad thing.

485
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
It's downtown.

486
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
He's dirty.

487
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
That's the only time he went downtown.

488
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
When did you give him 1000 yen?

489
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I gave it to him in the dressing room.

490
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:27,000
I thought you were going to throw a party or something.

491
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
I haven't done it yet.

492
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
I gave 100,000 yen to Endo, and 400,000 yen to me.

493
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
How much did you give him?

494
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I gave him a tire.

495
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
I forgot.

496
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
You don't have a tire.

497
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
That's right.

498
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,000
I see a lot of mischief.

499
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Your character is mischievous.

500
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
That's good.

501
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
It will grow soon.

502
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
But 400,000 yen is different.

503
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Keep doing mischief.

504
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
That's why I came here.

505
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I did my best.

506
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I received more than I expected today.

507
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:19,000
But you don't show up here often, do you?

508
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
No, I don't.

509
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
I don't have a day off.

510
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Why are you lying?

511
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
It's true.

512
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:33,000
I have 8 days off a week.

513
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
I really don't have a day off.

514
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
So I thought I'd go next year.

515
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Suddenly, in December, I told my manager.

516
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Hey, I don't have a day off.

517
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
It's been a long time since I've been on the same stage with you.

518
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,000
I'm sweating so much on this stage.

519
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Endo, say something good.

520
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Something is strange today.

521
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
I'm sweating a lot.

522
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
You're getting excited.

523
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,000
I've been watching you since a while ago.

524
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
I thought it was hard.

525
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
I thought so, too.

526
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:13,000
I felt sorry for you.

527
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
I'm finally better now.

528
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:19,000
There's a lot of white hair here.

529
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
But it's better today.

530
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Before the perm, I was like this.

531
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:38,000
This program was provided by the sponsor you see.
