1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
ANTON MOI MATSURI!!!

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
The super special project, the first appearance of Moe Toukon Hakone Inoki!

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I really hate it too!

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
In the familiar Oogiri Dai Gassen, the unpredictable happening takes place over and over again!

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
It's coming, it's coming, it's coming!

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
It's coming!

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
And now it's a big boom in the entertainment world!

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Eguchi, Tamio, Ujiki, Itoi, are throwing firecrackers at the fishing competition with downtown!

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Give it back to me!

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
In addition, there are tears to see, and tears to talk about!

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
The star is challenging with his life!

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Furiko Bungee, the five-faced special of tears!

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Oh, hello! It's been a long time since I've seen you!

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
And finally, the kid's special, Mazui Juice, is completed!

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'll give you anything you want!

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Eat an egg!

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
What the hell is this?

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
What the hell is this?

19
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
What the hell is this?

20
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
It's October 15th, 9 o'clock, 11 o'clock, 2 hours.

21
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I want to do a special with a kid.

22
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
This time I want to do it with just V.

23
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
When I look back on the past, I can bet on how flashy it was.

24
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Are you betting on money?

25
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I don't say that I spend a lot of money.

26
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Is that so?

27
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Yes.

28
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:25,000
There are more people on the screen.

29
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
It should be like that.

30
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
It's like I'm doing it.

31
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
It's a special.

32
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
It's flashy.

33
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
If it's not, I can't stop it.

34
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
What do you imagine a big one to be?

35
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
What?

36
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
What do you imagine a big one to be?

37
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
What do you mean by big?

38
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
It's lively.

39
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
It's flashy.

40
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
It's lively.

41
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
It's like a festival.

42
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
That's fine.

43
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
When I went to Spain last year, I saw the Ushioi festival.

44
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
It was amazing.

45
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
It had an impact.

46
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
There were a lot of people.

47
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
It was flashy.

48
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
It was like a festival.

49
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I think it's a good image for a special.

50
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Ushioi festival.

51
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Ushioi festival.

52
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Ushioi festival.

53
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
It's like that.

54
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
It's like that.

55
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
It's like that.

56
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
It needs something that changes to Ushioi.

57
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Something that changes to Ushioi.

58
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Something that changes to Ushioi.

59
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Something that changes to Ushioi.

60
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Something flashy.

61
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Something flashy.

62
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Even if you say so, it's not strong.

63
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
That's right.

64
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I don't think it's scary.

65
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
It comes out and runs away.

66
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
It's strange that it runs away.

67
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
It's strong.

68
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
It's dangerous to take one step at a time.

69
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
It's like the end of the line.

70
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
It's like a tension.

71
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
It's flashy.

72
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
7 a.m.

73
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
A large bus is lined up in front of the Japanese TV.

74
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
And the young comedians are gathering one after another.

75
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
They are about to face the biggest challenge of their lives.

76
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
They are given a contract.

77
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
No matter what accident happens, no one will pick up the corpse.

78
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Schoolday

79
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
The capital of passion, Spain.

80
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:26,000
It is a three-dimensional festival held every year in this country known as Tokyo.

81
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
It is a three-dimensional festival held every year in this country known as Tokyo.

82
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
They release a military ox.

83
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
And touching it is a sign of courage.

84
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
The most dangerous festival.

85
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
The most dangerous festival.

86
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
There is fear that goes beyond.

87
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
There is fear that goes beyond.

88
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
There is fear that goes beyond.

89
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,000
For the first time, the camera has entered the mysterious festival.

90
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
The first group has finally arrived at the festival's venue, Fujinosusono.

91
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
What is the fate of waiting for them?

92
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:09,000
From four buses, the young comedians get off one by one.

93
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
There are 200 of them.

94
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:19,000
And the costumes they wear are all red mufflers and red waistbands.

95
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
What does this mean?

96
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:29,000
There is no one to open their mouths, and they are covered by an invisible sense of anxiety.

97
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:52,000
And finally, the time has come.

98
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Hello.

99
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I've never seen you before.

100
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Thank you very much.

101
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Welcome to the traditional festival.

102
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I hope they won't get hurt.

103
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
You've participated in the festival many times.

104
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I was worried that you wouldn't be able to do it.

105
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I wonder if you've been deceived.

106
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Please explain the purpose.

107
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Today, we're going to...

108
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
What's that?

109
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
It's a cage.

110
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
It's a cage.

111
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Isn't it a festival?

112
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Something amazing is going to jump out.

113
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
There's a token towel here.

114
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Who is it?

115
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Who is it?

116
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Everyone, please jump out and take it.

117
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
If you take it, you'll be the one with the most guts.

118
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I want you to admit it to everyone who doesn't watch TV.

119
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
But it's a festival, right?

120
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
It's a festival.

121
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
It's fun, so don't say it.

122
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Please listen to me.

123
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Of course it's a festival, so I have a stall.

124
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
No way!

125
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
You can have as much fun as you want.

126
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Now, please welcome the player, sensei, to the ostrich club.

127
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Sensei!

128
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,000
We comedians have come here today without knowing what we're doing.

129
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:45,000
And I think it's a sign that the co-star and the staff are here.

130
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,000
But since we're here, the camera's position, the gun's position...

131
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:59,000
We're going to calculate everything and make a delicious reaction.

132
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Please give him a round of applause.

133
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Applause!

134
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Why didn't you practice at home for three hours?

135
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
It wasn't like a meeting.

136
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I was going to do something delicious.

137
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Do you think you're the only one who's going to do something delicious at a place like this?

138
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Ryu-chan, don't do that.

139
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,000
How the hell are you going to do that?

140
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Now, without further ado, we're going to have an opening ceremony.

141
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:44,000
We're going to invite this person.

142
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
What are you doing?

143
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Haru.

144
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
It's a cockfight.

145
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
What are you doing?

146
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
What is it?

147
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Scary, scary, scary.

148
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:59,000
That, that, that.

149
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
It's a festival.

150
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Yeah!

151
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Let's go.

152
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Yes.

153
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Where are we going?

154
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Let's go to the kid's special!

155
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Anton Festival!

156
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:36,000
After the opening ceremony, you start walking down the path to the nurse.

157
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Even if I get sick, if I can meet your smile and kindness, I'm looking forward to it.

158
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
It's a little complicated.

159
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I look forward to working with you.

160
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
For the time being, I look forward to working with you at that time.

161
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
To a higher degree, to a warmer medical care.

162
00:09:53,000 --> 00:10:21,000
It's a reliable medical device, Nipro.

163
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Pickle Nessa.

164
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Noebiya.

165
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Yosenabe.

166
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Grilled meat.

167
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Yosenabe.

168
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
There's another wave plate on the grill.

169
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Grilled meat is also delicious.

170
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Delicious.

171
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Tiger grill pot.

172
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
One more.

173
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
It's Tiger.

174
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
It's reliable, isn't it?

175
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
My second one.

176
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
There's another wave plate.

177
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I can do it.

178
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
My third one.

179
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Tiger hot plate.

180
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
One more.

181
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
It's Tiger.

182
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Anton Festival.

183
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Anton Festival.

184
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Mr. Matsuo, Anton Festival has just begun.

185
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:02,000
It's amazing.

186
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Will Inoki be able to do it?

187
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
It's terrible.

188
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Inoki, Inoki.

189
00:12:41,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I lost in front of the pool.

190
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:12,000
It's amazing.

191
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Yamazaki.

192
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:38,000
It's a terrible festival.

193
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:54,000
It's terrible.

194
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Everyone, let's fight.

195
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Mr. Matsuo is serious.

196
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:30,000
It's terrible.

197
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:40,000
It's terrible.

198
00:14:40,000 --> 00:15:08,000
It's terrible.

199
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:20,000
It's terrible.

200
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
You often complain about the distance from the venue.

201
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Where is the most dangerous place?

202
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Distance.

203
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
In Chikichi.

204
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Chikichi?

205
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
There's a cleaning lady.

206
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Lady?

207
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
It's a tunnel.

208
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I'll just tell you.

209
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
What?

210
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Wait a minute.

211
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I want to fall in love with you.

212
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I want to fall in love with you.

213
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I want to fall in love with you.

214
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Do you know Takayama Kiribasami?

215
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
It's Takaeda.

216
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I don't know.

217
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I don't know at all.

218
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I have a question for you.

219
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Why do you look at the clock?

220
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I don't know.

221
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
A clock?

222
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I don't know.

223
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
My name is Kalimen.

224
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Kalimen?

225
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
It's not easy to say.

226
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
What are you talking about?

227
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I don't know.

228
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Why are you a clown?

229
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Ouch.

230
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
What is that?

231
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
What was that?

232
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,000
What was that?

233
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Are you okay?

234
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Are you okay?

235
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
You have a friend who is a talent.

236
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
What?

237
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
He is a talent.

238
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
A talent?

239
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
What about you?

240
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
What?

241
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
What is the difference between you and Chonan?

242
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
What is the difference between you and Chonan?

243
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,000
What is the difference between you and Chonan?

244
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:30,000
This is a plane.

245
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Speak clearly.

246
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Where is your foot?

247
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:41,000
It's one centimeter square, right?

248
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
It's one centimeter square.

249
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Please check it.

250
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
This is also strange.

251
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Chikishiki.

252
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:04,000
This is Hamada Masatoshi.

253
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Let's have a special guest tonight.

254
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
One by one.

255
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Don't look at the person over there.

256
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
One by one.

257
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Please introduce yourself one by one.

258
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Last night, when I was at home, I was told to do my best.

259
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
So I opened the window and said thank you.

260
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Then the two boys happily went home.

261
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
This morning...

262
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
What is your name?

263
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
My name is Yamasaki Hosei.

264
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Nice to meet you.

265
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Next.

266
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:04,000
I'm Jimmy Onishi.

267
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I'm Miyagi.

268
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Nice to meet you.

269
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:20,000
The other day, I watched the video of the boy's talk for the first time.

270
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:28,000
He was very kind when he was talking.

271
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I'm Matsumoto from Shantan.

272
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Nice to meet you.

273
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Let's read the Atakamo book.

274
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
This is also familiar.

275
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Atakamo book.

276
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
It's not written like that.

277
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
It's just an English book.

278
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Let's proceed with the story as if it's written.

279
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
The first topic is this.

280
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,000
The happy friends with Elizabeth.

281
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
This is the book.

282
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
This book is called The happy friends with Elizabeth.

283
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:10,000
It's about when we were having a party in a garden in England.

284
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Who is Elizabeth?

285
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
It's the queen.

286
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
The queen?

287
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Who are the happy friends?

288
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Please explain that.

289
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:33,000
The happy friends are like this.

290
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:39,000
The party was a dinner party.

291
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Where did the friends go?

292
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:52,000
The friends gathered at the dinner party.

293
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
What do you want to say?

294
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Francesco Zabien was born.

295
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
What is that?

296
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
What is Francesco Zabien?

297
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
The friend of Elizabeth.

298
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
The friend of Elizabeth?

299
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Francesco Zabien was born.

300
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:27,000
The friend of Elizabeth.

301
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
We danced.

302
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
We danced happily.

303
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:38,000
At that time, the president came and kissed us.

304
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:43,000
What?

305
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:50,000
At the end, we all went somewhere to play.

306
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Let's talk about Zabien.

307
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Zabien is a wonderful friend.

308
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Zabien is dead.

309
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Don't kill such a good guy.

310
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:14,000
A letter came from Zabien.

311
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Another friend.

312
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Another friend?

313
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Pe...

314
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Pe...

315
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Pe...

316
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Pe...

317
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Pe...

318
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Pe...

319
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Pe...

320
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Pe...

321
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Then the bicycle broke down.

322
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:52,000
What the hell are you singing?

323
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Yes.

324
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Yes.

325
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
The space shuttle.

326
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Yes.

327
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Please don't look at it with cloudy glasses.

328
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
What are you talking about?

329
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
No one looks at it like that.

330
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
That's enough.

331
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Yes.

332
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Let's get on.

333
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Let's get on the space shuttle.

334
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Yes, yes.

335
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
There is a deep chair.

336
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Oh, is that so?

337
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Yes.

338
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,000
And by pushing this lever, the space shuttle starts.

339
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
I see.

340
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:34,000
When I saw that lever, I thought it was obviously a lever.

341
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Huh?

342
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
I thought it was that.

343
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Well then.

344
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Well, it's just a circle.

345
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:59,000
It has been used by various individuals of the 18th century.

346
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
What?

347
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:13,000
For example, the butt of the space shuttle is shaped like a lotus root.

348
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:20,000
The lotus root was the same shape no matter how much I cut it.

349
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Don't move it!

350
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:32,000
There is an on and off button.

351
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
It's easy to understand.

352
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Yes, it's easy to understand.

353
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:40,000
And I pushed the on button.

354
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
I pushed it hard.

355
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:49,000
And then the sound of the space shuttle started to echo.

356
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Yes.

357
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Before the space shuttle started to move, I pushed the lever forward.

358
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
And then the space shuttle...

359
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Hey, the phone is ringing!

360
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
After the commercial, Hama-chan is in trouble.

361
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
The biggest pain in the world.

362
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:13,000
I think that hair is important to take care of every day.

363
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Shampoo and treatment of the plant story.

364
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
It was finished with amino acid ingredients.

365
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
I want you to use it for a long time.

366
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
From the Lion.

367
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
From the Lion.

368
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
It's delicious to eat freshly cooked rice.

369
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
How much is it to eat freshly cooked rice?

370
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Why don't you say something?

371
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Stop it!

372
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
I see.

373
00:25:51,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Freshly cooked rice is delicious because of the strong firepower of the IH.

374
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
It's delicious.

375
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Tiger IH.

376
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Freshly cooked rice.

377
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
You can remove the lid and wash it.

378
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
It's Tiger.

379
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Big Challenge Toyota

380
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Today, we're going to ride it.

381
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Yes, we're going to ride it.

382
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Speaking of riding, we're doing a big market campaign where you can ride various cars at the Toyota store.

383
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
We're doing it.

384
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
I'm going to go too.

385
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
10,000 large market campaigns nationwide.

386
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,000
What Toyota has done for OneBox in the future.

387
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,000
For example, the safety design of the large indoor space.

388
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Granvia is here.

389
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Head-on!

390
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Head-on!

391
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
I'm going to play the music.

392
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Please tell the other person with the movement of your mouth.

393
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
First of all, the topic.

394
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
The topic is this.

395
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
What?

396
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
One ear?

397
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Mouth.

398
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
That's why.

399
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Show me your mouth.

400
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,000
So-re-te-ni-te-re.

401
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
I don't know.

402
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Please tell him now.

403
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
I don't know.

404
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
I don't know.

405
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
I don't know.

406
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
I don't know.

407
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
What is it?

408
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
I don't know.

409
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
I don't know.

410
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
What?

411
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Did you say it?

412
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
That's right.

413
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
That's right.

414
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Don't say it in a weird way.

415
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
I don't know.

416
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
The whole sentence is very natural.

417
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
That's right.

418
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Wakasanagi.

419
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Wakasanagi.

420
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Wakasanagi.

421
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Wakasanagi.

422
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Wakasanagi.

423
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
What did you say, Miyagi?

424
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
I don't know.

425
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
You don't know.

426
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
I don't know.

427
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
You don't know.

428
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Wakasanagi.

429
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Wakasanagi.

430
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Wakasanagi.

431
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Watatakayagi.

432
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Now,

433
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
I'll do my best.

434
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
The last one is Kokon Tozai.

435
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Omatani Monmari.

436
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Since it's a special,

437
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
I'll pay for it.

438
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Now, let's see the Monmari doll.

439
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Here you go.

440
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Wow.

441
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
The rules are explained.

442
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
The two players who sit side by side

443
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
will compete in Kokon Tozai first.

444
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
But if they can't answer,

445
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,000
a smelly crotch will come from the front.

446
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,000
And this time, there is a new challenge.

447
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
And this time, I'll open the back.

448
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,000
When the players sit here,

449
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
the person who came out of this box

450
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
will go to you.

451
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,000
The Monmari member will be decided here.

452
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Now, Matsumoto-san.

453
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Which box will you choose?

454
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Mari.

455
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
The member of the fourth box,

456
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
the Monmari member, please come out.

457
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Wow.

458
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Wow.

459
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Wow.

460
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Wow.

461
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Wow.

462
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
You're the worst.

463
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Wow.

464
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Wow.

465
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
I choose Mon.

466
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Now, the third box.

467
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Here you go.

468
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
The Monmari member, please come out.

469
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
I saw it.

470
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
I saw it.

471
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
What is this?

472
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Wow.

473
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
I can't breathe.

474
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Wow.

475
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Now, let's open it.

476
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
I'm talking.

477
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Who is this?

478
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Who is this?

479
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
A foreign band.

480
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
A foreign band?

481
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Ready.

482
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Cisco.

483
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Abba, Abba, Abba.

484
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Wow, Abba was taken.

485
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
I only had Abba next.

486
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Why?

487
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Ah.

488
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
You, you, you.

489
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
You too.

490
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Eagles.

491
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Eagles.

492
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
I don't know.

493
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Wow.

494
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Wow.

495
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Wow.

496
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
It's like a moss.

497
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
It's true.

498
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
The next song is an anime song.

499
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
An anime song.

500
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
One phrase is enough.

501
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Let's sing.

502
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Let's start with Mr. Matsumoto.

503
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
The first human, go, go, go.

504
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
My father is a salaryman.

505
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
The train is my life.

506
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
I raise my head.

507
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
50 years of my life.

508
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Long.

509
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Wait a minute.

510
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Why is it so long?

511
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Famous gag.

512
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
I'm doing it.

513
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
What?

514
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
What?

515
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
I'm shocked.

516
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
My brother is black.

517
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
I was surprised.

518
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
What?

519
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
No way.

520
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
I'm Goku.

521
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
What?

522
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Don't look at me.

523
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
What?

524
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Who are you?

525
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
I'm Genji Sawada.

526
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
What?

527
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
I'm Genji Sawada.

528
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
I'm Genji Sawada.

529
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
What?

530
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
I don't know what you're saying.

531
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
I don't know what you're saying.

532
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
My father.

533
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Who is Tsukie?

534
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
I don't know.

535
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Don't ask me anything.

536
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
I don't know.

537
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Who is it?

538
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Rice.

539
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Rice.

540
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Don't look at me.

541
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Ultracute.

542
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Dobby.

543
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Taro.

544
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Ultraman Ace.

545
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Ultraman from space.

546
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
What?

547
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
What?

548
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
What number is Yamazaki-san?

549
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
What number is Yamazaki-san?

550
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:47,000
No.1 box, please.

551
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Over here.

552
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Over here.

553
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
It's a line.

554
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
It's a line.

555
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
It's a line.

556
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Open.

557
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
It's so hard.

558
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Your pants are pink.

559
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Is this a live show?

560
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Pe-san, this is the setting.

561
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Yamazaki-san vs. the president.

562
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Let's start with the easy part.

563
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
The name of the fish.

564
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
The name of the fish.

565
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Tuna.

566
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000

Kamasu.

568
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Kamasu.

569
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
I said it.

570
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Sake.

571
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Fish.

572
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
I don't know.

573
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
I said it.

574
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
I said it.

575
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Yamazaki-san vs. the president.

576
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Tell me the name of the glasses.

577
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
I don't know the name of the glasses.

578
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
I don't know the name of the glasses.

579
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
I don't know the name of the glasses.

580
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
I'm sorry.

581
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
I'm sorry.

582
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
I'm sorry.

583
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
I'm sorry.

584
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
I'm sorry.

585
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
I'm sorry.

586
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
I'm sorry.

587
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
I'm sorry.

588
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Sushi.

589
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Tuna.

590
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Mackerel.

591
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Mackerel.

592
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
I said it.

593
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Time's up!

594
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Let's start with the easy part.

595
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
You sit here.

596
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Who's next?

597
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:11,000
I'm next.

598
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Who's next?

599
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
I'm next.

600
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Who's next?

601
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
I'm next.

602
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Who's next?

603
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
I'm next.

604
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
You can't do that.

605
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
You're not allowed to do that.

606
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
You can't do that.

607
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
You can't do that.

608
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
You can't do that.

609
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
What's wrong with you?

610
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
You can't do that.

611
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
You can't do that.

612
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
You sit here.

613
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Who's the classical composer?

614
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Who's next?

615
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
You can't do that.

616
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
You can't do that.

617
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
You!

618
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
You!

619
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
You!

620
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
You can't do that.

621
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
You can't do that.

622
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Beethoven.

623
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Schumann.

624
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
Tchaikovsky.

625
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
You can't do that!

626
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
You can't do that!

627
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
You can't do that!

628
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Sorry.

629
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Let's go to the third floor.

630
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Again?

631
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
What floor?

632
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
What floor?

633
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
You're laughing.

634
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
You should laugh.

635
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Should you laugh halfheartedly?

636
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
If you're laughing like that,

637
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
you should laugh loud.

638
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
You should laugh halfheartedly.

639
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
That's a silly face.

640
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
The members of Candy's!

641
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Candy's members!

642
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Candy's members!

643
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Dan-chan

644
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Su-chan

645
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Miki-chan

646
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Okay!

647
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,000
Wait, wait, wait, please don't do this

648
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
This is a big deal

649
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Wait, hey!

650
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Wait a second, hey!

651
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,000
I'm starting to feel really bad

652
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,000
I'm starting to feel really bad

653
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,000
I'm starting to feel anxious

654
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
I'm starting to feel anxious

655
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
I'm starting to feel anxious

656
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Open more, open more

657
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,000
From Akure-san, let's go! Three members!

658
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Wait a second!

659
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Jun-san, okay!

660
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Cho-saku

661
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Okay, Cho-saku, okay!

662
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Shoji-san

663
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Shoji-san, okay!

664
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Okay, last one, please!

665
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
I really don't like this either

666
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
It's still hot, it's hot!

667
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
It's still hot, it's hot!

668
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
It's still hot, it's hot!

669
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
It's still hot, it's hot!

670
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
It's hot!

671
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
It's hot!

672
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
It's hot!

673
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
It's hot!

674
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
It's hot!

675
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
It's cold!

676
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
It's hot!

677
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
It's really smelly!

678
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
There's a problem

679
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,000
If I'm late, the show will be canceled

680
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
That's just what you think

681
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
If I come on time,

682
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
the show will be canceled

683
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
That's just what you think

684
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
That's just what you think

685
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
It's really hot!

686
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,000
It's really hot!

687
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:34,000
It's really hot!

688
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
If I'm late, the show will be canceled

689
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
It's really hot!

690
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
It's really hot!

691
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Why?

692
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,000
That's why you're late!

693
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:58,000
After the commercials, it's time for the show to get hot!

694
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Now, the heat is getting hotter

695
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,000
This is the hot flavor

696
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,000
This is the hot flavor

697
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
This is the hot flavor

698
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Asahi Super Dry

699
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,000
The second bottle!

700
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Alright!

701
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
One more bottle!

702
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Alright!

703
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Hey, Kiki!

704
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Dad, one more bottle!

705
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
It's really good!

706
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
It's Asahi Dad's name

707
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
One more bottle!

708
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Yes, did you have a good time?

709
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
I've been a nurse for three months

710
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
I'm not a full-time nurse yet

711
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:41,000
But from the patient's point of view, I'm also a nurse

712
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,000
Even if it's hard, I can laugh at the patient's smile

713
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:49,000
I'll do my best not to betray your trust

714
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
What's wrong?

715
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Excuse me!

716
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,000
With Yoriko, we'll take you to a warmer place

717
00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:23,000
With Yoriko, we'll take you to a warmer place

718
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Cosmetic LUNESSA

719
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,000
Noevia

720
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Is it still good?

721
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Even if it's cut in half, it's not that big

722
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
If there were two, it would be enough

723
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
I think so too

724
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,000
No, that's impossible

725
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,000
It's only two hours

726
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Also, there are a lot of specials coming up

727
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
I see

728
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
In that sense, I want something fresh

729
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Like casting

730
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
That's right

731
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
Then, let's do it outside

732
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
Let's do it outside

733
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,000
Outside is good

734
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Outside is good

735
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,000
In the first episode of Gaki no Tsukai Arai, we have a special

736
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:03,000
Celebrity Tsurikichi

737
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,000
Hello

738
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,000
We're back

739
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,000
When you think of downtown, you think of a black bus

740
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Everyone in the world thinks that

741
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Today, we have a special

742
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Celebrity Tsurikichi

743
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Let's gather

744
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
We're going to do it

745
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,000
It can't be helped

746
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
I want to do it

747
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,000
First, Itoi Shigesato

748
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Nice to meet you

749
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,000
Nice to meet you

750
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:36,000
I think it would be nice if you could do it

751
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,000
If it's something you don't understand, you can do anything

752
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Yes

753
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
It's hard

754
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Is this season hard?

755
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,000
It's hard

756
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,000
When we did it last time, it was fine

757
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:51,000
But this time, we can do it even in Hamada

758
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:54,000
Anyway, I was overwhelmed by that big one

759
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
Yes

760
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,000
That's big

761
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Look, 46? 47?

762
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
There are 47

763
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:10,000
I think it's the biggest I've ever caught

764
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,000
Your face has changed

765
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:16,000
You were kind until now

766
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:20,000
I want to be a kind uncle

767
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,000
That's why I'm going to catch it

768
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
If you can catch it, please catch it

769
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
Next, Mr. Ujiki Tsuyoshi

770
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
It seems to be a good one

771
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
It's good

772
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
This is important

773
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:38,000
When you come to Kawaguchiko, you have to buy an entry ticket

774
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:42,000
This is connected to the maintenance of Mizuimi and the protection of fish

775
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,000
I recommend fishing cooperation

776
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,000
I really like to be fashionable

777
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,000
I'm not fashionable

778
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
Please do your best

779
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,000
Next, Mr. Okuda Tamiyo

780
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,000
Hello

781
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,000
I was fishing without a job

782
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,000
When you come here, you have to fish a little

783
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:10,000
When I first started, I couldn't fish in Kawaguchiko

784
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,000
When I first came here, I couldn't fish

785
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
It's a lie

786
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:18,000
I met my wife in Kawaguchiko

787
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
Don't say nonsense

788
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
Please do your best

789
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
Finally, Mr. Eguchi Yosuke

790
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:30,000
Eguchi is fishing

791
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,000
I came here about two years ago

792
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:36,000
I haven't been fishing recently

793
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,000
Kawaguchiko is like a pond

794
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Are you tired of fishing here?

795
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:44,000
I'm tired of fishing here

796
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,000
What are you talking about?

797
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:50,000
What do you think of this member?

798
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
He is a strong opponent

799
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:55,000
Who is the strongest?

800
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:58,000
I heard a lot of rumors

801
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:01,000
I went fishing with Mr. Itoi once

802
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
How was it?

803
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
It was amazing

804
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Eguchi doesn't care about downtown

805
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
That's not true

806
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
I will explain the rules

807
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:15,000
If you catch a big fish, you win

808
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
It's a big fish

809
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
Let's start

810
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
Thank you

811
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
Let's go

812
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Can you bring me a boat?

813
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:32,000
You can bring me a boat

814
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Are you ready?

815
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:38,000
Let's go

816
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,000
Let's do our best

817
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Let's go

818
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:47,000
I'm happy to think this is my job

819
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:53,000
The competition is about to begin

820
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:58,000
I've been fishing since last night

821
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:02,000
I want to fish twice as much as yesterday

822
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,000
My rival is Hamada

823
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:07,000
I hate Hamada

824
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
I hate him

825
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:12,000
I'm doing this as a science teacher

826
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:16,000
If I catch fish at my usual pace, I can fish

827
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,000
I have my own will

828
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:22,000
If I win, I will win

829
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:27,000
I have a long career

830
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
I can't lose

831
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:32,000
I wear a hat to fight

832
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
I won't lose

833
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,000
I'm going to fish

834
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:40,000
Everyone is strong today

835
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,000
I'll do my best

836
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
Thank you

837
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:49,000
Everyone is going to fish

838
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:52,000
But the temperature is 15 degrees

839
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:55,000
You need advanced techniques to lure the enemy

840
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:58,000
The same goes for downtown

841
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:04,000
I'm wearing a hat

842
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,000
Hamada's first fish is...

843
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:14,000
I'm sorry

844
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,000
I should have fished

845
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Eguchi's rod is too big

846
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:28,000
Eguchi's rod is too big

847
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,000
The pot is a magic pot

848
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
It's a magic pot

849
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:37,000
It's easy to cook

850
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
It's easy

851
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
Tiger Magic Pot

852
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
It's a tiger

853
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:48,000
The pot is small, but it can cook a lot

854
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:52,000
It's electric, so it's easy to cook

855
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
The pot's mirror

856
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Tiger Electric Pot

857
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
It's a tiger

858
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:02,000
It's smooth, shiny

859
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:05,000
It's smooth, shiny

860
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:09,000
It's smooth, shiny

861
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
It's smooth, shiny

862
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
From the lion

863
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
I'll take a walk later

864
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:18,000
My head hurts

865
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:22,000
The buffalo is gentle and fast

866
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,000
I'm going

867
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,000
I want to heal my headache quickly

868
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
From the buffalo

869
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:32,000
I'm going to catch a fish

870
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,000
I'm going to catch a fish

871
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:39,000
I'm going to catch a fish

872
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:43,000
I'm going to catch a fish

873
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:46,000
This is the news of the fall

874
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:49,000
Takeyuki Asahi's harvest sale

875
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
Asahi cultivation festival raw beer

876
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:54,000
This fall's delicious beer is

877
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
Asahi's cultivation festival

878
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
A new appearance!

879
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:03,000
In the shadow of the battle of Sekigahara, another battle between the two women unfolds.

880
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:06,000
In Sengoku Allcast, Jishu Yoru Kuji no Shitteri Tsumori is...

881
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,000
The joy and sorrow of a woman who has survived a turbulent life.

882
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:13,000
Toyotomi Hideyoshi's Wife, Nene, A Disaster of the Heart

883
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,000
Here it comes!

884
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,000
Ah, I missed it!

885
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,000
I missed it!

886
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,000
I missed it!

887
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,000
I missed it!

888
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,000
I missed it!

889
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
I'm so disappointed!

890
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,000
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

891
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
Hey, hey, hey!

892
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
You look so sad and happy!

893
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,000
Hey, hey!

894
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,000
As for me...

895
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
It's getting a little hot.

896
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,000
Ah, I took it off!

897
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,000
I took it off.

898
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
I took it off and spread it out again!

899
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
I'm so disappointed!

900
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:52,000
On the other hand, the designated combination is really at my pace.

901
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
As soon as I got to the jighead, it came.

902
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
It's the speed of the season.

903
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,000
It's pretty nerve-racking, isn't it?

904
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
At this time of the day.

905
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,000
Did it come?

906
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,000
Did it come?

907
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,000
What a surprise!

908
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
It hit Matsumoto right at the start!

909
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,000
Ah, it's coming!

910
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
It's coming!

911
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
The first hit is Matsumoto.

912
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:21,000
It's coming!

913
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
It's not that big, though.

914
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:30,000
But I can see the impatience.

915
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:38,000
I can see the color of impatience.

916
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,000
No, no, no.

917
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
Patience! Patience!

918
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
The downtown team caught it.

919
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
This is bad.

920
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:54,000
The Itoi-Ujiki combination doesn't even know that it allowed Matsumoto to take the lead.

921
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
Ah, it's coming!

922
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
Ah, it's coming!

923
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,000
Liar!

924
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,000
Masuka!

925
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
It's still hooked.

926
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:12,000
It's still hooked.

927
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
It's still hooked.

928
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,000
Look at this! It's huge!

929
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,000
Look at this!

930
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,000
Look!

931
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:23,000
It seems that Hamada is hooked today.

932
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,000
Oh!

933
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,000
It's coming!

934
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,000
It's coming!

935
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:38,000
It's coming! It's coming!

936
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
45 minutes have passed.

937
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
I'm curious about the other boats.

938
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:48,000
Is Hamada finally hooked?

939
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
I carefully approach him.

940
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
For a moment, I thought so.

941
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
We met again.

942
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:01,000
I hope it doesn't become zero for the program.

943
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:09,000
The Itoi-Ujiki boat is approaching while changing the point.

944
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
It's too big.

945
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,000
It was amazing.

946
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,000
It was amazing.

947
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,000
It's big.

948
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,000
It's a rabbit.

949
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
I'm hungry.

950
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:25,000
It's been an hour.

951
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:28,000
Only one of the Matsumoto's boats is still hooked.

952
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,000
Everyone!

953
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,000
Let's move!

954
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,000
Let's move!

955
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,000
Let's move!

956
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
Why aren't you all moving?

957
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,000
Let's move!

958
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,000
Let's move!

959
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,000
I'm sorry!

960
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,000
We're moving!

961
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,000
Let's move!

962
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
I'll take you to the next place.

963
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,000
Let's move!

964
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:47,000
The two of us are going to the next place.

965
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,000
Let's move!

966
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,000
It won't end like this.

967
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
Taking pride in Tsurikichi,

968
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:57,000
I head to the shore of the lake to change the point.

969
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:02,000
Anxiety and anxiety make everyone nervous.

970
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:05,000
Is there a black bass at this point?

971
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,000
It's coming, isn't it?

972
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,000
Yes.

973
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:14,000
I think it's coming.

974
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,000
It's coming, isn't it?

975
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,000
It's definitely coming.

976
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,000
It's coming.

977
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,000
It's slow.

978
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
It's a good transfer.

979
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,000
It's definitely there.

980
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,000
Eguchi is...

981
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
...going crazy again.

982
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:39,000
I have a bad feeling about this.

983
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,000
I'm so frustrated.

984
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:48,000
Itoi and Ujiki are one step away from each other again.

985
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,000
Alright!

986
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
And finally, Itoi hits it.

987
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,000
Alright!

988
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,000
That's good.

989
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,000
Grab it!

990
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
It seems to be in a bad shape.

991
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
Itoi seems to have caught it.

992
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,000
Egiichi!

993
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,000
What is this?

994
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,000
What did you do?

995
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:11,000
You should be more excited.

996
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:17,000
On the other hand, Ujiki, who has no chance at all, is in a strange mood.

997
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:21,000
I shouldn't have been impatient.

998
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
Shake, shake, shake.

999
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,000
Shake, shake, shake.

1000
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
You're good at playing.

1001
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,000
What's wrong?

1002
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
Hey, hey, baby.

1003
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
Baby.

1004
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
What's going on?

1005
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:41,000
Eguchi Okuda is hit by a bus pro.

1006
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,000
That's a pro.

1007
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
It's quiet over there.

1008
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,000
It's talking.

1009
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,000
It's like...

1010
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:00,000
It's like a friend has died.

1011
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,000
It's raining.

1012
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:06,000
It's raining non-stop.

1013
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:09,000
It's the worst condition.

1014
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
Hamada is still...

1015
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,000
Oh, it's you again.

1016
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
You come often.

1017
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
Hey, look again.

1018
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,000
You're good at it.

1019
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
Hey, you're here.

1020
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,000
Welcome home.

1021
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
Hey, you're here.

1022
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:39,000
Okuda and Egiichi have come to the abandoned Kansai.

1023
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
The sound of the reels echoes lonely.

1024
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
And Hamada...

1025
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,000
...is in a big trouble.

1026
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,000
Something's stuck.

1027
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,000
It's stuck.

1028
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
Okuda is finally hit.

1029
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,000
Damn it.

1030
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,000
Did you get it?

1031
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,000
I got it.

1032
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
I'll get it.

1033
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:04,000
I got a reel.

1034
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,000
Damn it.

1035
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:13,000
I don't think I can do this no matter how many times I do it.

1036
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
Anyway, they can't catch it.

1037
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
There's only a little time left.

1038
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:19,000
I got it.

1039
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,000
Did you get it?

1040
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:26,000
They've already caught a blue sea urchin.

1041
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,000
I got it.

1042
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:31,000
Itoi has finally caught the second one.

1043
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
What's that firework?

1044
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
And the sign of the end rang.

1045
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:44,000
I just heard a strange sound, but I don't know.

1046
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
I don't know.

1047
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
I wonder if they're waiting for something.

1048
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
It's over.

1049
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
It's over.

1050
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,000
It's over?

1051
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,000
It's over now.

1052
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,000
Really?

1053
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,000
It's over.

1054
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,000
It's over.

1055
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,000
It's over.

1056
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,000
It's over.

1057
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:04,000
It's over.

1058
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:05,000
It's over.

1059
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,000
It's over.

1060
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,000
It's over.

1061
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:08,000
It's over.

1062
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,000
It's over.

1063
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,000
It's over.

1064
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:18,000
After 120 minutes of fighting, the fishermen have returned.

1065
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,000
It's cold.

1066
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
The results are out.

1067
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:33,000
Everyone has a cooler box in front of them.

1068
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
First of all, it's Itoi.

1069
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,000
Itoi.

1070
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,000
Itoi.

1071
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
What is it?

1072
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
It's a little plain.

1073
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,000
How much is this?

1074
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,000
It's small.

1075
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,000
This is different.

1076
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
How do you know this?

1077
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
It's about 27.

1078
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,000
27?

1079
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:56,000
27?

1080
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,000
27.

1081
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:00,000
Let's open Tsuyoshi Ujiki's.

1082
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
It's not here.

1083
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:06,000
It's good, it's good.

1084
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
I'm really happy.

1085
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
Let's open it gradually.

1086
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:14,000
This was caught by Mazumoto.

1087
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
I can't hold it.

1088
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:19,000
Endure it and put it in here.

1089
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
I'm not a girl.

1090
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
I'm scared.

1091
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
What are you doing?

1092
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
Hold it down.

1093
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
It's big.

1094
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
It's like this.

1095
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:34,000
It's big.

1096
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
It's over here.

1097
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
28.

1098
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:44,000
Let's look at Yosuke Eguchi.

1099
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
It's not here.

1100
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
It's in.

1101
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:57,000
Let's look at Okudatami at the end.

1102
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:58,000
It's here.

1103
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
It's big.

1104
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
It's big.

1105
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
It's not here.

1106
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
It's small.

1107
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
It's small.

1108
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
It's just right.

1109
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,000
It's just right.

1110
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:15,000
This is 28cm, Mazumoto's.

1111
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
Thank you.

1112
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:20,000
I'm going to give it to you.

1113
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
I want this.

1114
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:25,000
This is the dream of a fisherman.

1115
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
I want this.

1116
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
This is the dream of a fisherman.

1117
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
Everyone, thank you for your hard work.

1118
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
Let's eat.

1119
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
This is delicious.

1120
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:52,000
Today's winner is Mazumoto's.

1121
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
It's amazing.

1122
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
He signed it.

1123
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
It's amazing.

1124
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
It's big.

1125
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
It's rare to see this size.

1126
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
It's good.

1127
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
I want to do this.

1128
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
I want to win.

1129
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:19,000
This first tournament closed the curtain with Mazumoto's victory.

1130
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:24,000
I realized that I didn't have enough conversation with the fish.

1131
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:28,000
Before the tournament started, I caught some fish.

1132
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
I lost.

1133
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
I'm glad I caught it.

1134
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
If I can catch it, I can't catch it.

1135
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
It's a big deal.

1136
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:42,000
Next time, let's catch a big fish.

1137
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
Thank you for your hard work.

1138
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
Thank you for your hard work.

1139
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
Thank you for your hard work.

1140
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
Thank you for your hard work.

1141
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
Next time, let's catch a small fish.

1142
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:12,000
After this, I won't be a kid anymore.

1143
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
After this, I won't be a kid anymore.

1144
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
When is this going to be broadcasted?

1145
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
It's going to be broadcasted in two days!

1146
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:28,000
Two days?

1147
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
Two days? I can't say it sideways!

1148
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
Who are you asking?

1149
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
Sideways?

1150
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:37,000
I can't say it sideways!

1151
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
Let's do it!

1152
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
After this, I won't be a kid anymore.

1153
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
When is this going to be broadcasted?

1154
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
In two days!

1155
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,000
After this, I won't be a kid anymore.

1156
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
After this, I won't be a kid anymore.

1157
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
This is similar, right?

1158
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:08,000
Right?

1159
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
They're all similar!

1160
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,000
After this, I won't be a kid anymore.

1161
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,000
I'll be a mysterious transfer student.

1162
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
After this, I won't be a kid anymore.

1163
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
I'll be a mysterious transfer student.

1164
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
After this, I won't be a kid anymore.

1165
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
I won't be a kid anymore.

1166
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
After this, I won't be a kid anymore.

1167
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
Let's start with the old man.

1168
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
What are you talking about?

1169
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
After this, I won't be a kid anymore.

1170
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
I'm scared!

1171
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
After this, I won't be a kid anymore.

1172
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
You guys aren't good viewers!

1173
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
After this, I won't be a kid anymore.

1174
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
After this, I won't be a kid anymore.

1175
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
I'll do a new gag.

1176
01:04:58,000 --> 01:04:59,000
A new one?

1177
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
Yes, a new one.

1178
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
It's my first time doing it.

1179
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
After this, I won't be a kid anymore.

1180
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
After this, I won't be a kid anymore.

1181
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:18,000
I won't be a kid anymore.

1182
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
After this, I won't be a kid anymore.

1183
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
Watch me!

1184
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,000
After this, I won't be a kid anymore.

1185
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
Don't watch the opening!

1186
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
After this, I won't be a kid anymore.

1187
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
Nice to meet you.

1188
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
What was that? I forgot.

1189
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
I'll do it again.

1190
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:44,000
After this, I won't be a kid anymore.

1191
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
I won't be a kid anymore.

1192
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
From 5 seconds ago.

1193
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:53,000
5, 4, 3, 2...

1194
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
Wait a minute!

1195
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
Your seconds are weird!

1196
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
Let's go with a sharp taste.

1197
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
5, 4, 3...

1198
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
5 seconds ago!

1199
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
Please.

1200
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
5 seconds ago.

1201
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
5 seconds ago.

1202
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
5, 4...

1203
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
Let's continue.

1204
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
5 seconds ago.

1205
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
Just once.

1206
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,000
Just once.

1207
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
5 seconds ago.

1208
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:36,000
5, 4, 3, 2, 1...

1209
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
That's it!

1210
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
A special episode with the kids!

1211
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:46,000
A nostalgic reunion with the stars!

1212
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
Hello.

1213
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:55,000
Today, we have a special episode with the kids.

1214
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:59,000
From now on, we'll have the stars appear.

1215
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:04,000
There are people you want to see, right?

1216
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:08,000
We've invited people who want to see us.

1217
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
They're here to see us.

1218
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:14,000
Then, let's have the first guest appear!

1219
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
Please!

1220
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
Haru!

1221
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
I'm sorry for being such a star.

1222
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
Haru Ichiban.

1223
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:30,000
He was 16 when he started working for Amaguri Taro.

1224
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:34,000
Back then, he didn't know what to do.

1225
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:38,000
But he was kind and strict with his parents.

1226
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
His name is Misao Watanabe.

1227
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:44,000
Today, he'll be seeing him for the first time in 11 years.

1228
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
What will you do if you see him?

1229
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:50,000
If I see him, I'll tell him that I brought him to this world for 11 years.

1230
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
He's been doing this a lot lately.

1231
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:55,000
I want him to do this with me.

1232
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:56,000
With Inoki?

1233
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
With Inoki.

1234
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
I don't know if I'll be able to see him or not.

1235
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
I don't know if I'll be able to see him or not.

1236
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:05,000
For now, let's have him set up.

1237
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
What do you mean, set up?

1238
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,000
There's a setting to meet him.

1239
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
Let's set it up.

1240
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
Please set it up.

1241
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:16,000
What does this have to do with meeting him?

1242
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:20,000
A special episode for the kids.

1243
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:23,000
The star's long-awaited meeting.

1244
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:26,000
Let me explain how to meet him.

1245
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:30,000
We've prepared 3 cranes that are 30 meters high.

1246
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:33,000
Today's guests will be lifted up to the top of the mountain.

1247
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:36,000
They'll be released into the windmill.

1248
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:39,000
After that, they'll be able to meet him.

1249
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:42,000
Please lift him up.

1250
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:53,000
You don't have to see him anymore.

1251
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:56,000
Let's start with Haru Ichiban.

1252
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:59,000
Let's have him meet his boss, Watanabe.

1253
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:02,000
Let's have him meet his boss, Watanabe.

1254
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:05,000
5 seconds to meet him.

1255
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:06,000
4

1256
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:07,000
3

1257
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:08,000
2

1258
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:09,000
1

1259
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:12,000
5 minutes to meet him.

1260
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:18,000
1, 2, 3, 4, 5 minutes to meet him.

1261
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:21,000
Watanabe!

1262
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:26,000
1, 2, 3, 4, 5 minutes to meet him.

1263
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:29,000
Watanabe!

1264
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:34,000
1, 2, 3, 4, 5 minutes to meet him.

1265
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:37,000
What's going on?

1266
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:44,000
What's going on?

1267
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:48,000
His boss is going home soon.

1268
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
I don't think he'll be able to meet him.

1269
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:53,000
1 or 2 seconds to meet him.

1270
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:57,000
Next, let's have the guests come in.

1271
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:04,000
This is Mr. Manman.

1272
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
Who do you want to meet?

1273
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:09,000
He's my first partner.

1274
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
What's his name?

1275
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:14,000
Oscar Mescal.

1276
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:17,000
That was bad.

1277
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:20,000
I don't want to say it, but it's embarrassing.

1278
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
I'm Oscar.

1279
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:23,000
I'm Oscar.

1280
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
Thank you.

1281
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:26,000
I want to meet Mescal.

1282
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:29,000
It's embarrassing.

1283
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
He's from the east.

1284
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:35,000
His first partner when he was a student, Shinichiro Kodama.

1285
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:40,000
He returned the 20,000 yen he borrowed from a poor student for the first time in 13 years.

1286
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
I was so frustrated.

1287
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
I'll be better than him.

1288
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:47,000
Someday, I'll return the 20,000 yen.

1289
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:50,000
That's a great chance today.

1290
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:51,000
Really?

1291
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:54,000
I can see it from above.

1292
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
Can you see it from above?

1293
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:59,000
I can definitely see it from above.

1294
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
Let's go give it back.

1295
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:04,000
Let's go give it back.

1296
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
Let's set it up.

1297
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:07,000
What kind of setting is that?

1298
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
It's the setting of the 5th generation.

1299
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
What do you mean, please?

Is this a situation where you're going to return the money?

I have money.

1302
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:19,000

Let's do this until we can have a meeting

1391
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:10,000
Are you sure?

1392
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:14,000
I feel like I'm going to cry

1393
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:17,000
Right, Higashi-san?

1394
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:21,000
You should have a stiff neck

1395
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:25,000
Let's go to the setting

1396
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:28,000
It's not here?

01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
It's called a harness

1399
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:35,000
I'm used to it

1400
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:38,000
How many times have you put it on?

1401
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:43,000
I don't think I need to put it on

1402
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:48,000

01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,000
You have a sports meeting tomorrow

1407
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:05,000
I don't need to sit in the PTA seat

1408

Please get in

1409
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:11,000
This is really scary

1410
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:16,000
Stop it!

1411
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:19,000

Long time no see!

1428
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:24,000
Brother, did you talk to Yoko?

1429
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:28,000
I talked to her very briefly.

1430
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
I'm so embarrassed.

1431
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
I said, long time no see.

1432
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
You said, I'll call you later.

1433
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:45,000
I said, I'll call you later.

1434
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:53,000
Oh, I'm scared.

1435

You guys are too terrible!

1462
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000

01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
Yes.

1471
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
I finally found it.

1472
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000

The aroma has become new.

1477
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
I think it's better to be new.

1478
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
Take a new aroma.

1479
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
It's a lie.

1480
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000

1481
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
I'm going to dye my hair.

1482
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
Don't pull it straight.

1483
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
Don't hurt your hair.

1484
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
Easy straight.

1485
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
It's easy, isn't it?

1486
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
Maxim

1487
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:46,000
Do you choose coffee because of the aroma?

1488
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:50,000
If you don't have this aroma, you can't call it Maxim.

1489
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
The masterpiece of aroma.

1490
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
Maxim

1491
01:22:54,000 --> 01:23:00,000
New Super Mild Shampoo

1492
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:04,000
New Super Mild Shampoo

1493
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:10,000
New Super Mild Shampoo

1494
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:24,000
New Super Mild Shampoo

1495
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
New Super Mild Shampoo

1496
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
New Super Mild Shampoo

1497
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
New Super Mild Shampoo

1498
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
Do you want to talk?

1499
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
Hey

1500
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
What are you doing?

1501
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
Hey

1502
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
New Super Mild Shampoo

1503
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
What are you laughing at?

1504
01:23:48,000 --> 01:24:02,000
power

1505
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
Beemer Baby

1506
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:08,000
What the hell is this?

1507
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:13,000
10 yen!

1508
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:14,000
Here you go.

1509
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:15,000
Thank you.

1510
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:18,000
Idiot!

1511
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
He wanted to be a policeman.

1512
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
What the hell is this?

1513
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
Well, well, well, well.

1514
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:27,000
Even with such a look, he's a bastard.

1515
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,000
Then when you're done with the evidence, go home right away!

1516
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:32,000
Oh, that's right!

1517
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:37,000
See you later.

1518
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:42,000
Even with such a look, when you're done with the evidence, go home right away!

1519
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:45,000
Idiot!

1520
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:50,000
That's right!

1521
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:54,000
What the hell is this?

1522
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:58,000
Idiot!

1523
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:01,000
Can you leave?

1524
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:03,000
By the way, where are you from?

1525
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:06,000
I don't know.

1526
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:09,000
You're so mean!

1527
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:12,000
What the hell are you eating?

1528
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:13,000
Shall we go home?

1529
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:15,000
Yes.

1530
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:18,000
What the hell are you eating?

1531
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
You.

1532
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:21,000
It's my first time.

1533
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:27,000
It's your first time?

1534
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:31,000
What the hell are you eating?

1535
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:34,000
Die!

1536
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:37,000
There are three foreign guests today.

1537
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,000
Even if you do this?

1538
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:42,000
It doesn't matter.

1539
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
Please tell me what it is.

1540
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
Mr. Enzo.

1541
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
Mr. Enzo?

1542
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:49,000
Speak clearly.

1543
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:52,000
You can't sell it like that.

1544
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:57,000
There's a date course near Port Pier Hotel in Kobe.

1545
01:25:57,000 --> 01:26:01,000
It doesn't matter whether you know it or not!

1546
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:05,000
He's wearing a full-blown Soviet mask.

1547
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:06,000
Do you know?

1548
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:07,000
I don't know!

1549
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,000
Get out!

1550
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:12,000
What time is it now?

1551
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
Four o'clock?

1552
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
It's a little less than four o'clock.

1553
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
It's about half past ten.

1554
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
It's a little past ten.

1555
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
It's a little less than four o'clock.

1556
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:23,000
What are you going to do?

1557
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,000
What should I do?

1558
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,000
Something that's connected to the regulars?

1559
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:29,000
It's a special for the regulars.

1560
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:31,000
That's right.

1561
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:33,000
What's connected?

1562
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:36,000
That's what I've been talking about lately.

1563
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
Juice?

1564
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
Is that kind of thing connected?

1565
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:48,000
I've been telling you, but you're not listening.

1566
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:49,000
It's juice.

1567
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:53,000
It's really bad.

1568
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:56,000
This commercial is bad, too.

1569
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
It's bad for your health, too.

1570
01:26:58,000 --> 01:26:59,000
It's really bad.

1571
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:02,000
Get out!

1572
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
A special for the regulars.

1573
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:07,000
A bad juice project.

1574
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:12,000
The annual production volume of our country's juice is 12.72 million kiloliters.

1575
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:16,000
Last year, 873 new products were introduced.

1576
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:20,000
The juice industry is in conflict with the 4.5 trillion yen market.

1577
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
While each company is working hard to make it delicious,

1578
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:29,000
our users dare to make bad juice and sell it.

1579
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:32,000
We immediately asked each beverage company for cooperation.

1580
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:36,000
I'd like to make a bad juice and sell it.

1581
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:39,000
Would you like to cooperate?

1582
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,000
Yes, I understand.

1583
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:46,000
While each company was struggling with the phrase, bad,

1584
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:49,000
we finally got a response from a beverage company.

1585
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:52,000
The staff went there without taking anything.

1586
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:53,000
Thank you very much.

1587
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:55,000
I got it. Let's do it.

1588
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:58,000
But I can't make anything bad for your health.

1589
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:02,000
And after the negotiation, we got the president's approval.

1590
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
The five causes of badness are

1591
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:07,000
sweetness, spiciness, bitterness, sourness, and smell.

1592
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:10,000
It's in these exquisite blends.

1593
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:13,000
It's hard to make a juice that goes against the world.

1594
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:20,000
After many trials and errors, we finally got a sample.

1595
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
Let's start with today's order.

1596
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:25,000
This is Matsumoto family's water.

1597
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:27,000
Matsumoto family's water.

1598
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:30,000
It tastes like iron-smelling water.

1599
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:36,000
There are many people who drink this kind of water.

1600
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:39,000
It doesn't look good.

1601
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:42,000
If you go to a restaurant, you'll see this.

1602
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
Squid ink beverage.

1603
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:48,000
It tastes like sweet and sour with squid ink.

1604
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:52,000
It tastes like hot cake syrup.

1605
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:55,000
It's not good.

1606
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:58,000
This is not good.

1607
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
Super carbonated beverage.

1608
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:04,000
Let's soak the taste and drink up to the limit of carbonation.

1609
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:07,000
I like this.

1610
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:10,000
I like this.

1611
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
I like this.

1612
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
Spice juice.

1613
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:19,000
The combination of wasabi and chili pepper creates an unexpected bitter taste.

1614
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:22,000
It stinks.

1615
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:26,000
This is not good.

1616
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:29,000
This is not good.

1617
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:32,000
This is not good.

1618
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:35,000
It smells like poop.

1619
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:37,000
Stinky juice.

1620
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:42,000
It blended the flavor of Dorian and challenged the ultimate smell.

1621
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
It stinks.

1622
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
It stinks.

1623
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
I already smelled it.

1624
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
It stinks.

1625
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:54,000
This is Matsumoto family's water.

1626
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:57,000
It stinks.

1627
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:58,000
This is not good.

1628
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:03,000
It smells really bad.

1629
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:09,000
This is not good.

1630
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:13,000
What are you doing?

1631
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:15,000
What are you doing?

1632
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:18,000
It stinks.

1633
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
Get out of here.

1634
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:23,000
And the candidate juice is...

1635
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:26,000
Dorian flavored stinky juice.

1636
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:33,000
It is cultivated in Southeast Asia and is praised as the king of tropical fruits.

1637
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:38,000
However, for some reason, it is forbidden to bring it to the first-class hotels in Southeast Asia.

1638
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:43,000
It is to make the inside of the river smell like rotten onions.

1639
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:46,000
Dorian is addicted to stinky juice.

1640
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:53,000
The project was supposed to proceed smoothly with this juice.

1641
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:57,000
I'm sorry, but there's a problem with the juice.

1642
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:58,000
What is it?

1643
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:01,000
The situation is not good.

1644
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:05,000
Help me.

1645
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,000
Are you kidding me?

1646
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:17,000
The third boss of the tourism industry.

1647
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:23,000
The seven-seater GT Chariot has various uses.

1648
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:26,000
It is powerful.

1649
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,000
Mitsumishi New Chariot.

1650
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:31,000
Okaidoku Resort Runner MS is here.

1651
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:41,000
My, my curry is with rice.

1652
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:43,000
Three minutes in the microwave.

1653
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:44,000
Otsuka's new recipe.

1654
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:47,000
The name of the product is...

1655
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,000
I don't need anything.

1656
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:51,000
I'll throw it away.

1657
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:53,000
I'm looking for you.

1658
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:54,000
With my soul.

1659
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:55,000
Don't stop the time.

1660
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:56,000
Shout it out.

1661
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,000
I can't stand it.

1662
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:01,000
I'll give you all of me.

1663
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,000
It's time to dye it.

1664
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
Dye it.

1665
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
It's easy to dye.

1666
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
Dye it.

1667
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:15,000
It's easy to dye.

1668
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:17,000
It's beautiful.

1669
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:22,000
It's time to dye it.

1670
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
It's beautiful.

1671
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,000
It's easy to dye.

1672
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,000
It's easy to dye.

1673
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:35,000
It's night.

1674
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:37,000
It's easy to dye.

1675
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:38,000
Good morning.

1676
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:40,000
Good morning.

1677
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:43,000
A new elixir that prevents dullness of the skin.

1678
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:45,000
Dramatical Essence.

1679
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:47,000
How do you feel?

1680
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:52,000
Why didn't you say anything?

1681
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:53,000
Hello?

1682
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,000
I...

1683
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:57,000
I know.

1684
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,000
I like it because it doesn't change.

1685
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:02,000
Suntory New Chariot 1880 yen.

1686
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:05,000
New Chariot 1880 yen.

1687
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:08,000
I'm sorry.

1688
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:09,000
It's about the juice.

1689
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:11,000
There was a problem.

1690
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:15,000
It was a harsh reality that was waiting for us.

1691
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:17,000
Due to Dorian's terrible smell,

1692
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:20,000
the production line will be unusable.

1693
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,000
Due to the factory's production prohibition,

1694
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
the project was approved.

1695
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:29,000
New sample production became urgent.

1696
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:31,000
New Chariot 1880 yen.

1697
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:32,000
Hello.

1698
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:33,000
Good morning.

1699
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:34,000
Good morning.

1700
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,000
A very spicy juice.

1701
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
Two red peppers in one.

1702
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:41,000
It's so spicy that you can't drink it without water.

1703
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:43,000
First, drink it.

1704
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:45,000
I don't know if it's spicy.

1705
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:47,000
Is it spicy?

1706
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:48,000
It's spicy.

1707
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:52,000
It's spicy.

1708
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,000
What is this?

1709
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
The feeling is strange.

1710
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:57,000
The feeling is strange.

1711
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:59,000
What kind of feeling is this?

1712
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
This is amazing.

1713
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
It's a fire.

1714
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:09,000
It hurts.

1715
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:13,000
If you drink one, you can eat two red peppers.

1716
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:15,000
If you drink one, you can eat two red peppers.

1717
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:19,000
How many lemons can you eat?

1718
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:21,000
It's a stinky juice.

1719
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:24,000
It reduced the smell of the previous one to one-tenth.

1720
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:29,000
We have to be careful when producing this.

1721
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:30,000
Is it a stinky one?

1722
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:31,000
Yes.

1723
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,000
It's much thinner.

1724
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:37,000
It's bad.

1725
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:41,000
It's a tea without sweetness.

1726
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:42,000
It's famous as a diet drink.

1727
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
It's a tea without sweetness.

1728
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,000
I don't know if it's a little bitter.

1729
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:51,000
It's not normal.

1730
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:54,000
It's not sweet at all.

1731
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000
Drink it.

1732
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
It's not sweet at all.

1733
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:01,000
It's not sweet at all.

1734
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:03,000
It's not sweet at all.

1735
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:04,000
What is this?

1736
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:05,000
It's not sweet at all.

1737
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:18,000
It's the final decision.

1738
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:24,000
I think it's the first one today.

1739
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:27,000
It's either the first one or the last one.

1740
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:31,000
What happens if you warm the first one?

1741
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:33,000
I think it will work.

1742
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:35,000
It will be warmed.

1743
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:37,000
It's normal.

1744
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:39,000
I'm sorry.

1745
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:51,000
I think it's okay to drink it all at once.

1746
01:35:51,000 --> 01:36:07,000
I think it's okay to drink it all at once.

1747
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:25,000
I'm going to drink a bad juice.

1748
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:27,000
I don't like it.

1749
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:30,000
I don't like it.

1750
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:35,000
It's burning.

1751
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:38,000
It's burning.

1752
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
What is this?

1753
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
It's not sweet at all.

1754
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
It's not sweet at all.

1755
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:53,000
I don't like it.

1756
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:03,000
I don't like it.

1757
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:06,000
I'm getting numb.

1758
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:10,000
In winter, the mouth gets warm.

1759
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:13,000
It's only the mouth that gets warm.

1760
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:16,000
It's like I'm getting cold around here.

1761
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:19,000
A bad juice that shocked the members.

1762
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:21,000
What is the truth?

1763
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:29,000
It will lead humanity to a new world.

1764
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,000
It's called Gakimizu.

1765
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,000
What is this?

1766
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:41,000
It tastes like the tears of a dragon or the sweat of a fox.

1767
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:43,000
It will make the world go crazy.

1768
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:46,000
It's the worst taste that mankind has ever tasted.

1769
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,000
Gakimizu in downtown.

1770
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:51,000
It will be on sale this year.

1771
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:56,000
After the commercial, something will happen at the children's meeting room.

1772
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:09,000
It's true. It's delicious.

1773
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:14,000
Mineral water for dry skin in dry season.

1774
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:18,000
You can use it anytime, anywhere. It feels good.

1775
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:22,000
It's just right for the dry skin to melt a little.

1776
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,000
Natural mineral water.

1777
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:25,000
Let's use it.

1778
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:28,000
Shall we do it?

1779
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:29,000
It's Yu-mai.

1780
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:30,000
Look.

1781
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:31,000
It's delicious.

1782
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:34,000
It's delicious.

1783
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:35,000
It's delicious.

1784
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:36,000
It's delicious.

1785
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:37,000
It's delicious.

1786
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:38,000
It's delicious.

1787
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:39,000
It's delicious.

1788
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:40,000
It's delicious.

1789
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:43,000
Welcome.

1790
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:44,000
What is it?

1791
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,000
That hat doesn't suit you.

1792
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:47,000
I'm worried about my hair.

1793
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:49,000
Then it's Adelance's Pinpoint Cyber.

1794
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:52,000
Strong and light nature. Pinpoint Cyber.

1795
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:54,000
Call me.

1796
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:55,000
Where's your father?

1797
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:04,000
I'll start with this coffee.

1798
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,000
I like Nescafé Kusada.

1799
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:10,000
I like Nescafé Kusada.

1800
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:14,000
A driving feel that has never existed before.

1801
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:17,000
Invex II Sports Mode 5 speed AT.

1802
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,000
I'm sure it will change the sedan.

1803
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,000
New Diamante.

1804
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:25,000
A new special user, the new 25X.

1805
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:31,000
The new liquid is moist and sticky.

1806
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,000
It feels good.

1807
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:35,000
This is non-oily.

1808
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:38,000
It's moist, but it's not sticky all the time.

1809
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,000
Optune Liquid Foundation.

1810
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:42,000
It's big.

1811
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:45,000
Do you want that one?

1812
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:46,000
That's not what I mean.

1813
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:47,000
How is it?

1814
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:51,000
Only the delicious part is the best.

1815
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:52,000
It's delicious.

1816
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:54,000
That's right.

1817
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:58,000
Nescafé Kusada's Pinpoint Cyber.

1818
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:02,000
Come on out.

1819
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:03,000
No chicken!

1820
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:09,000
I'm wearing this skirt even though my legs are like this.

1821
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:11,000
It's so cold.

1822
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:21,000
It's cold.

1823
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:23,000
It's okay.

1824
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:36,000
The cats gather and start to fight.

1825
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,000
When that's over, the next one is...

1826
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:43,000
I understand.

1827
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:45,000
I haven't said anything yet.

1828
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:50,000
It doesn't matter when it comes back.

1829
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:55,000
It doesn't matter at all.

1830
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:58,000
It doesn't matter when it comes back.

1831
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:07,000
I'm going to run away quickly.

1832
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:08,000
I'm going to run away quickly.

1833
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:24,000
It doesn't matter.

1834
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:25,000
It doesn't matter at all.

1835
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:30,000
It doesn't matter when it comes back.

1836
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:31,000
It doesn't matter when it comes back.

1837
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:34,000
The step is so hard.

1838
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:38,000
This is all I can do.

1839
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:45,000
Why is Matcha so beautiful?

1840
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:49,000
What are you doing?

1841
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:50,000
What are you doing?

1842
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:53,000
What are you doing?

1843
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:55,000
What do you want?

1844
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:12,000
You're so big, but you're still so small.

1845
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:14,000
What are you doing?

1846
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:17,000
What are you doing?

1847
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:19,000
I think there's one more.

1848
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:20,000
I think there's one more.

1849
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:21,000
I think there's one more.

1850
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:29,000
Can you spend money again?

1851
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:30,000
What?

1852
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:31,000
Can you spend money again?

1853
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:32,000
Money? I don't have any money.

1854
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:33,000
You don't have any money?

1855
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:34,000
I don't have any money.

1856
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:35,000
I don't use it anymore.

1857
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,000
So, from Hama-chan,

1858
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:43,000
I'd like to ask Matcha if she can do skydiving.

1859
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:44,000
Skydiving?

1860
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,000
After the commercial, something happened to Matcha.

1861
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:50,000
What will you do?

1862
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:53,000
The real Honbushi Honkatsu.

1863
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:55,000

The new Honbushi Honkatsu.

1868
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:13,000
The new Honbushi Honkatsu.

1869
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:17,000
The new Honbushi Honkatsu.

1870
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:20,000
The new Honbushi Honkatsu.

1871
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:22,000
The bubbles are...

1872
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:23,000
The bubbles are...

1873
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:25,000
The bubbles are...

1874
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:26,000
Do you know?

For example,

1881
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:57,000
For example,

1882
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:59,000
It's a chocolate like kinu.

1883
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:02,000
It's a chocolate like kinu.

1884
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:04,000
No matter what, it's kinu.

We deliver delicious rice from all over the country.

1902

What did you say?

1904
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:00,000
What did you say?

1905
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,000
Skydiving and...

1906
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:05,000
Heipo Torimonocho

1907
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:07,000
What?

1908
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:10,000

Heipo Torimonocho are listed.

1910
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:28,000

01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:31,000
What are you doing?

1912
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:32,000
Ema-chan.

1913
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:34,000
Skydiving and...

1914
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:37,000
Heipo Torimonocho are listed.

1915
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:39,000
Which one is good?

1916
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:45,000
I think it's better to close it with you at the end.

1917
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:49,000
What do you think?

1918
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:50,000
What do you think?

1919
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:53,000
Well...

1920
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:55,000
It's not good to do it.

1921
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:57,000
It's not good to do it.

1922
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:59,000
It's not good to do it.

1923
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:02,000
Hama-chan's overseas trip is good.

1924
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:03,000
It's good.

1925
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:04,000
It's good.

1926
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:05,000
It's good.

1927
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:11,000
It's hard. It's a goal.

1928
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:17,000
It's a strange story to go abroad without a purpose.

1929
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:18,000
It's overseas.

1930
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:20,000
It's overseas.

1931
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:24,000
It's been a long time.

1932
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:26,000
But 30 minutes...

1933
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:28,000
Okamoto-chan did it.

1934
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:29,000
It's not good to go.

1935
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:32,000
It's a long time ago.

1936
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:34,000
It's better to close it gradually.

1937
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:39,000
At the end, it's us.

1938
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:50,000
It's a long time ago.

1939
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:55,000
What should I do?

1940
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:59,000
I don't know if it's okay to do that.

1941
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:00,000
I wonder if it's okay.

1942
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:01,000
That's the idea.

1943
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:02,000
That's the idea.

1944
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:05,000
I don't know if it's okay to do that.

1945
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:06,000
I don't know if it's okay.

1946
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:10,000
I don't know.

1947
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:16,000
It's hard.

1948
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:17,000
I wonder if it's okay to do that.

1949
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:20,000
I wonder if it's okay to do that.

1950
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:25,000
Ok, I'll do it.

1951
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:29,000
You must watch it.

1952
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:49,000
I wonder if it's okay to do that.

1953
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:51,000
What should I do?

1954
01:47:51,000 --> 01:48:08,000
I wonder if it's okay to do that.

1955
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:10,000
What should I do?

1956
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:30,000
I wonder if it's okay to do that.

1957
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:50,000
I wonder if it's okay to do that.

1958
01:48:50,000 --> 01:49:18,000
I wonder if it's okay to do that.

1959
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:32,000
I wonder if it's okay to do that.

1960
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:40,000
Did you sleep well?

1961
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:41,980
Do it.

1962
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:42,980
What do you think?

1963
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:48,980
Like a splash.

1964
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:49,980
Um.

1965
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:50,980
What to do.

1966
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:52,980
We've done a lot of patterns.

1967
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:53,980
What to do.

1968
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:55,980
What do you think, Seiko?

1969
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:56,980
Right now?

1970
01:49:56,980 --> 01:50:11,960
Like a splash.

1971
01:50:11,980 --> 01:50:13,960
What do you think?

1972
01:50:13,980 --> 01:50:14,960
Um.

1973
01:50:14,980 --> 01:50:15,960
What to do.

1974
01:50:15,980 --> 01:50:17,960
What?

1975
01:50:17,980 --> 01:50:18,960
Let's do it like that.

1976
01:50:18,980 --> 01:50:19,960
Good.

1977
01:50:19,980 --> 01:50:20,960
Good work.

1978
01:50:20,980 --> 01:50:21,960
Good work.

1979
01:50:21,980 --> 01:50:22,960
Good work.

1980
01:50:22,980 --> 01:50:23,960
What to do.

1981
01:50:23,980 --> 01:50:24,960
Good work.

1982
01:50:24,980 --> 01:50:25,960
Good work.

1983
01:50:25,960 --> 01:50:26,940
Good work.

1984
01:50:26,960 --> 01:50:27,940
Good work.

1985
01:50:27,960 --> 01:50:28,940
Good work.

1986
01:50:28,960 --> 01:50:29,940
Get the car in the car.

1987
01:50:29,960 --> 01:50:30,940
Yeah.

1988
01:50:30,960 --> 01:50:31,940
Good work.

1989
01:50:31,960 --> 01:50:32,940
Good work.

1990
01:50:32,960 --> 01:50:33,940
Good work.

1991
01:50:33,960 --> 01:50:35,940
Good work.

1992
01:50:35,940 --> 01:50:38,940
Thank you very much.

1993
01:50:38,940 --> 01:50:40,940
Thank you very much.

1994
01:50:40,940 --> 01:50:42,940
Thank you very much.

1995
01:50:42,940 --> 01:50:44,940
Thank you very much.

1996
01:50:46,940 --> 01:50:48,940
What the hell is going on here?

1997
01:50:50,940 --> 01:50:52,940
What the hell is going on here?

1998
01:50:53,940 --> 01:50:55,940
I took a dump in the morning.

1999
01:50:57,940 --> 01:50:58,940
Hi.

2000
01:50:58,940 --> 01:50:59,940
It's been a while.

2001
01:50:59,940 --> 01:51:00,940
It's been a while.

2002
01:51:01,940 --> 01:51:03,940
Don't do that.

2003
01:51:03,940 --> 01:51:05,940
I feel sorry for you.

2004
01:51:05,940 --> 01:51:07,940
These are new shoes.

2005
01:51:07,940 --> 01:51:10,940
I bought new shoes because I thought they were really new.

2006
01:51:10,940 --> 01:51:12,940
It's only a few seconds old.

2007
01:51:16,940 --> 01:51:18,940
It's not old, is it?

2008
01:51:18,940 --> 01:51:20,940
It's not old, is it?

2009
01:51:20,940 --> 01:51:22,940
It's not old, is it?

2010
01:51:22,940 --> 01:51:24,940
It's not old, is it?

2011
01:51:24,940 --> 01:51:25,940
It's not old, is it?

2012
01:51:25,940 --> 01:51:33,940
It's not old, is it?
