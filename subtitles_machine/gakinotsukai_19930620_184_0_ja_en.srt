1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
After this, I'll go to downtown to buy a kid's toy.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I spent a lot of money.

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:57,000

4
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:04,000

9

I wonder if I can sing well.

10
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Hama came from Hiroshima 10 years ago.

11
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
He came here somehow.

12
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I did it.

13
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I think it's because Hama was there.

14
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
What are you talking about, Machan?

17
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:35,000
The person who forgot Corona remembers the weight of his knees.

18
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:47,000
The long moon-lit lap of his knees was smoking.

19
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I hate you. I miss you. I hate you. I miss you.

20
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:25,000

24
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I talked too much.

25
