00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Good luck Matsumoto, on your way to become a hunter.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Hello.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I want to see your face a little more.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Today I want you to help me on my way to become a hunter.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
It's a condition.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Please do your best.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
You do your best too.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I will do my best.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
This is a duck.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Bring it on!

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
What?

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Sorry, it was my fault.

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I shouldn't have done that.

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
You scared me.

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Please.

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I'm sorry.

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
You shouldn't have done that.

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I didn't do that on purpose.

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Right?

20
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
You shouldn't have done that.

21
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
You shouldn't have done that.

22
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
That's not true.

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
What?

24
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
It's already decided.

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Really?

26
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Bring it on!

27
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Hama-chan, Hama-chan.

28
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
It's not like that.

29
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
What?

30
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
It goes like this.

31
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
What?

32
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
It goes like this.

33
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Do you understand?

34
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I don't understand.

35
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Bring it on!

36
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
It's a prey.

37
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Wow!

38
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
The duck has become a pig.

39
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Pig?

40
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Don't say that.

41
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Where are we today?

42
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
We are at Namco's company.

43
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
What are you doing here?

44
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I'm here to...

45
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
What do you call it?

46
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
What is it?

47
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
You know, right?

48
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
What?

49
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
You know, right?

50
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
This is the only place where you can play that game.

51
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
That's why I want to train here.

52
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I want you to support me.

53
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
You want me to support you?

54
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
That's what I want to do.

55
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
This is the place.

56
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Now, let me eat something delicious.

57
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
That's not it.

58
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:19,000
That's not it.

59
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:32,000
This program is brought to you by the following sponsors.

60
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:41,000
We have a lot of games that we don't have here.

61
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
What do you think?

62
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
It's fun.

63
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
It's like a dream country.

64
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I don't understand.

65
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Why are you so low today?

66
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
What?

67
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I'm happy.

68
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
If you're so excited, you'll lose to Pink's phone.

69
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Now, this one.

70
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
This one.

71
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I want to try this one.

72
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
You don't have to say it.

73
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
It's working.

74
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
You don't have to say it.

75
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:34,000
It's hard.

76
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Why?

77
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I don't know.

78
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Damn it.

79
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
It's hard.

80
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Isn't mine too low?

81
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
No.

82
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Damn it.

83
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
It's low.

84
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I'm sure it's that one.

85
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
That's not it.

86
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I'm counting.

87
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Can you eat it?

88
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Ha!

89
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
It's a game over.

90
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
What?

91
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
It's a game over.

92
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
40 against 180.

93
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Why is the dog better?

94
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
It's delicious.

95
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I don't want to play this game.

96
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
This is interesting.

97
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Namco's big push.

98
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
It doesn't look fun.

99
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,000
It's made by electric machine.

100
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
You're touching it with your hand.

101
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
It's electric.

102
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
This monkey.

103
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
This monkey.

104
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I'll do it.

105
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Lucky monkey.

106
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
The title is interesting.

107
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
What do you do?

108
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
You dig it?

109
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Yes.

110
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
It's hard.

111
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Is this it?

112
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Namco.

113
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Namco-san.

114
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Namco-san.

115
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
It's over.

116
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
That's it.

117
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
You don't understand Japanese at all.

118
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Do it one more time.

119
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Ha!

120
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Even if you don't say it, it'll come out.

121
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Ha!

122
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Even if you don't say it, it'll come out.

123
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
It was fast.

124
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Ha!

125
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Only two hits.

126
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Only two hits.

127
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I'll do it in one shot.

128
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Hurry up.

129
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
You hit it just now.

130
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Really?

131
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Leave it to me.

132
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
What are you doing?

133
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Stop it.

134
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Why?

135
00:05:50,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Why are you using a gun?

136
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Everyone is fine.

137
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Let's do our best to talk today.

138
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
We don't have much time.

139
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
We don't have much time.

140
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
We'll finish at 8.30.

141
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Wait a minute.

142
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
We'll finish at 8.30.

143
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
We'll finish at 8.30.

144
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Really?

145
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Yes.

146
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
What are you doing?

147
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I'm the one who's going to finish at 8.30.

148
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:37,000
You're lying.

149
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I'm the one who's going to finish at 8.30.

150
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Otomo!

151
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Your shoes.

152
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
You're so silly.

153
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I'll get a letter.

154
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I'm a little curious.

155
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Who's the leader?

156
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Are you curious?

157
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I don't think it's a good idea to point out the leader.

158
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Really?

159
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
That's right.

160
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
It's not a good idea to point out the leader.

161
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,000
When the leader is decided, the gala will change.

162
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
The leader has a certain movement.

163
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I thought I was the leader.

164
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I don't know what you're thinking.

165
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
It's up to you to decide.

166
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Really?

167
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
When you think of the leader,

168
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
For example, if you think of Goranger...

169
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Red Ranger.

170
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Red Ranger.

171
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Red Ranger has thick eyebrows.

172
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I think I'm the leader.

173
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
That's...

174
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
That face is cool, but it's scary.

175
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:05,000
It's scary because I'm the leader.

176
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
For example,

177
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
There's a group called Cool Five.

178
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I'm with...

179
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Uchiyamada Hiroshi.

180
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Uchiyamada Hiroshi and Cool Five.

181
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Why is Uchiyamada Hiroshi the leader?

182
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:24,000
That's why he brought up the idea of doing it.

183
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
He brought it up?

184
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I think so.

185
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
The first thing he said was the leader.

186
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Then it's me.

187
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Why?

188
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,000
You're the one who decided on the printing company.

189
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:47,000
If I didn't say anything, you'd be sweating.

190
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I don't think there's such a thing as an interesting printing company.

191
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I don't know how to do it.

192
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I don't know who's doing it.

193
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I haven't given up on my dream of being a printer yet.

194
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
You haven't given up on your dream?

195
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I can be a printer anytime.

196
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:15,000
There's a lot of printing companies out there.

197
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
You're a professional.

198
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
It's scary.

199
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Can you stop it?

200
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I failed yesterday, so I'm saying it.

201
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
That's right.

202
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Yesterday, Fujimaki Jun.

203
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
He's actually a cutler.

204
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
He's in a commercial.

205
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
He's in a commercial.

206
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
He was in the dressing room.

207
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
He said,

208
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,000
You're bald!

209
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
He's not bald.

210
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
He always says he's bald.

211
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
He always says that to me.

212
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Who was it?

213
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
The girl in the costume?

214
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
You're bald!

215
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Give me my shoes!

216
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
You're bald!

217
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
When I said that, Fujimaki Jun came out.

218
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
No, no.

219
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
He came out to talk about himself.

220
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
He came out because he was called.

221
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
You're bald.

222
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
No, no.

223
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
He came out because he was called.

224
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
That's right.

225
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
He's bald.

226
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
He came out to talk about himself.

227
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
You did a great job.

228
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
The two of you are going to be bald.

229
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I told you to wear the pants I prepared in advance.

230
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
If you wear your own pants, you won't be able to go home.

231
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I took off my own pants and took off the pants I prepared.

232
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I took off my own pants and took off the pants I prepared.

233
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
What is this?

234
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I took off my own pants and took off the pants I prepared.

235
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
My pants.

236
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Who saw my pants?

237
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,000
My pants are patterned in eight.

238
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
He was annoyed and came up to me.

239
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
He said, I'm sorry for the girl in the costume.

240
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
He said, These are my pants.

241
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I said, Take my pants off.

242
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
He was about to wear it.

243
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Because he was about to wear it.

244
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I asked, Are you wearing it the wrong way, Hamada san?

245
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
He said, I can't say anything earlier.

246
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
He took off my pants and put it on the girl in the costume.

247
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Please stop it! My panties are wrapped around my neck!

248
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Why are you doing this to me?

249
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
That girl's hair is completely white.

250
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
What?

251
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Out of fear?

252
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I don't know what to do.

253
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I don't know what to do.

254
00:11:53,000 --> 00:12:00,000
But my panties are wrapped around my neck.

255
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I don't care about that.

256
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I feel sorry for you.

257
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Please stop it!

258
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Why are you doing this to me?

259
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I don't know what to do.

260
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I don't know what to do.

261
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I don't know what to do.

262
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I don't know what to do.

263
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I don't know what to do.

264
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Looking at you like that, I feel like I should stop.

265
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I feel like I should stop.

266
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I'll be the leader.

267
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I don't care.

268
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
They should come on time.

269
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
You'll be the leader at the end.

270
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
You're a fool!

271
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
That's right.

272
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
You should come first.

273
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
You mean the leader?

274
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Of course!

275
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Great people come later.

276
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I don't care about the great people.

277
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I mean the leader.

278
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I don't care about the leader.

279
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I just want to be the first one.

280
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
You should be the first one.

281
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Idiot!

282
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
You don't have to do this.

283
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
You should be the first one.

284
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
No, the leader should be the first one.

285
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
That's what the leader is.

286
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
You are the leader even though you are a leader.

287
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
The leader is not important.

288
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
The leader is just a name.

289
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
You are the boss.

290
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
If you want to fight, you should be sitting in the chair like this.

291
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
You are wearing uniform like this.

292
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:38,000
The leader is the last one who comes out.

293
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
No, it's not important.

294
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
You should be the last one who comes out.

295
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I don't care about the leader.

296
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I want to be the first one.

297
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I'm going to tell everyone about the dinner joke.

298
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
What's that dinner joke?

299
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Isn't it a dinner joke?

300
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
What's that?

301
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
He's here!

302
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
He'll come, right?

303
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
He's here, so I can relax.

304
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Right?

305
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
What's that?

306
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Oh, you're an amateur?

307
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
No.

308
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
What do you mean, no?

309
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Is there something in there?

310
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Here, here.

311
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Huh? But you have a book.

312
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
What do you mean?

313
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
What do you mean, what do you mean?

314
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Well, you know,

315
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
people like that write their own history.

316
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Oh, is that so?

317
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Yes, yes.

318
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Well, it's written on the back of the book.

319
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Oh, is that so?

320
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
It's written by Mariko Sagamoto.

321
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Well, her father's name is Mitsuo.

322
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
What's that?

323
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
It's dirty, isn't it?

324
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
What's your mother's name?

325
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Oh, her name is Yoshiko.

326
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
What do you mean by that?

327
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
She's in a good health condition.

328
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
She would have died early if she was like that.

329
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
It's dirty, isn't it?

330
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
It's flashy.

331
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Huh?

332
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
This.

333
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
It's shiny, isn't it?

334
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
You have a good pelvis, don't you?

335
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Right?

336
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Did you have a good pelvis or something?

337
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Yes, I had a good pelvis.

338
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Right?

339
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Do you have a pelvis shop at home?

340
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Are you the princess of the pelvis kingdom?

341
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Are you the prince of the pelvis village?

342
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Thank you very much.

343
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Thank you very much.

344
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
What's this?

345
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
You should open it yourself.

346
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
It's a letter from someone else.

347
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Morukome-kun's big reward.

348
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
It's shiny.

349
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Look.

350
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Do it yourself.

351
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
To your father and mother.

352
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
To your father and mother.

353
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Congratulations.

354
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:10,000
This is an announcement of the 8th generation Morukome-kun's big reward, the 4th generation selection committee's passing.

355
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
This is an announcement of the final selection committee.

356
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I didn't say anything, but you passed the 4th generation selection committee.

357
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I passed.

358
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:27,000
The children on that day, please wear a hat.

359
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
The clothes are Morukome-kun's T-shirt.

360
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
That's not bad.

361
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:38,000
When you receive it, you will be given a Morukome-kun T-shirt.

362
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
And a pair of pants.

363
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
This is for each of you.

364
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
We will pay for the transportation fee.

365
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Please take care of it.

366
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
How many people will come?

367
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Well, we received applications from all over the country.

368
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Out of 25,251 people, your children passed the 4th generation selection committee.

369
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:12,000
They were selected as the final selection committee of 50 people.

370
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I would like to congratulate you.

371
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I will give you this.

372
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I can't participate, so I have to push it.

373
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,000
50 people, 50 people passed the selection committee.

374
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
It's amazing, isn't it?

375
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
But I can't go on this day.

376
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
This again.

377
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
What?

378
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
This again.

379
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
What?

380
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Really?

381
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
This again.

382
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
You know better than me.

383
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I can go, but my father and mother can't come.

384
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Why?

385
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I don't know.

386
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I'm going.

387
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
You are not my father.

388
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I'm going.

389
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
It stinks.

390
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
It stinks.

391
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
I'm going.

392
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
You are not selected, so you can't go.

393
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I don't want to give up.

394
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Why do you give up?

395
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Because it's strange.

396
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
It's a waste.

397
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Why is it a waste?

398
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
What?

399
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
What?

400
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
What?

401
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I want to come.

402
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
You can't go.

403
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
What?

404
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Let's go.

405
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
No, Matsumoto came alone.

406
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Where did you hear this story?

407
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I'm always a bachelor.

408
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
You're a bachelor?

409
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Why are you Marukome-kun?

410
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Marukome-kun is a bachelor.

411
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
You're a bachelor and Marukome.

412
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,000
If you're in the video game, you'll be called a bachelor and Marukome.

413
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Really?

414
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:08,800
Ah, ahh...

415
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:07,920
But, not just

416
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:08,000
But, not just

417
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:08,020
But, not just

418
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:09,000
But, not just

419
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:09,060
But, not just

420
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:10,480
But, not just

421
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,060
pressed a little

422
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:13,960
Your hand andare

423
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,880
Oh no

424
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:21,900
Hey, a boy

425
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:22,200
Hey, a boy

426
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:22,320
Oh no

427
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,660
Oh burden

428
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:25,460
Pressed a little

429
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:27,000
You simply don't say that

430
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:27,740
I know

431
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:29,420
I don't want to say that

432
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:31,420
He's holding his head down.

433
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,420
Oh, that's funny.

434
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:34,420
Let's move on to writing.

435
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:34,920
What?

436
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,420
Let's move on to writing.

437
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:38,420
No, I'm serious.

438
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:40,420
What's the pen name?

439
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:41,420
I don't know.

440
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:42,420
Good evening, Machiyama-chan.

441
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:44,420
I'm always having fun with you.

442
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:47,420
Recently, I often dream of becoming a celebrity.

443
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:50,420
The other day, when I called my mother in my dream,

444
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:54,420
Koyanagi Rumiko came out with something like a naked negligee.

445
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:57,420
Since then, when I see Koyanagi Rumiko, I can't think of anyone else.

446
00:19:57,420 --> 00:20:02,420
Machiyama-chan, has a celebrity come out in your dream?

447
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:04,420
Has anyone come out before?

448
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:05,420
I don't know.

449
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:06,420
I have.

450
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:08,420
I'm famous.

451
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:09,420
Yashiro Aki came out.

452
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:11,420
Oh, Yashiro Aki.

453
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:14,420
You're writing about Yashiro Aki, aren't you?

454
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:15,420
Why did he come out?

455
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:17,420
What's Yashiro Aki like?

456
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:23,420
Since then, he was quite famous.

457
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:27,420
Sake has a slimy texture.

458
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:28,420
Fish is...

459
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:31,420
Don't sing while you're singing.

460
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:34,420
Why are you in such a hurry to get married?

461
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:37,420
Why are you singing while you're singing?

462
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:38,420
That's enough.

463
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:40,420
The light is faintly...

464
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:43,420
That's enough.

465
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:46,420
It's disgusting.

466
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:48,420
If you sing while you're singing like that, it's disgusting.

467
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:53,420
That's enough.

468
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:56,420
I haven't seen WM yet.

469
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:58,420
Let's leave little by little.

470
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:00,420
Not yet.

471
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:04,420
We talked a lot today.

472
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:07,420
There's still more.

473
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:09,420
She's angry.

474
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:10,420
She's angry.

475
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:13,420
There's nothing.

476
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:22,420
There's no man like that.

477
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:24,420
Let's go home.

478
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:28,420
Let's go home.

479
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:32,420
Let's go home.

480
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:35,420
Everyone, let's dance together.

481
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:43,420
Yes.

482
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:46,420
She's embarrassed.

483
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:52,420
Please be quiet.

484
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:55,420
The best.

485
00:21:55,420 --> 00:22:11,420
This is the best.

486
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:16,420
Let's go home.

487
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:20,420
Let's go home.

488
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:26,420
Let's go home.

489
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:29,420
Hello.

490
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:34,420
It's time to celebrate the 100th anniversary.

491
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:36,420
It's a project to celebrate the 100th anniversary.

492
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:38,420
How about doing this?

493
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:40,420
I'm going to ask for an idea.

494
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:42,420
What do you think?

495
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:46,420
They're here, but they're trying to get us involved.

496
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:48,420
It's none of your business.

497
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:52,420
They're our viewers.

498
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:54,420
They're trying to get us involved.

499
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:56,420
It's none of your business.

500
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:58,420
It's none of your business.

501
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:01,420
I think that's possible.

502
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:04,420
I think that's possible.

503
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:08,420
I think that's possible.

504
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:13,420
I also need an assistant.

505
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:18,420
I've been writing about this idea for the past two years.

506
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:21,420
I've been writing about this idea for the past two years.

507
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:23,420
Send me more and more.

508
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:25,420
Send me more and more.

509
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:30,420
I can't go home without a

510
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:32,420
Thank you very much.

511
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:35,420
Thank you very much.

512
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:40,420
This program was brought to you by the following sponsors.
