1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Next, everyone is crying! Yama-chan's Happy Wedding!

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Today, the other day...

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
This is the worst!

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
This is the worst kind of show!

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
This is the worst kind of show!

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I don't think this will be on the show for a while.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
It's short.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
But the V-app is pretty long.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Really?

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
That means you'll be able to watch it a lot.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I heard that it was very moving.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I think I'm going to get a lot of money for this show!

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Who's going to pay for this?

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
That's right.

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
After finding out that she's pregnant,

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
the 33-year-old comedian, Yamazaki Hose,

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
happily decided to get married.

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
The other day, he had a very moving show with only his family.

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Today, we'll reveal the whole story!

20
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Let's have the star of the show, Yamazaki Hose, come on out!

21
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Why do you have such a face?

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Nice to meet you!

23
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Why do you have such a face?

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Please take care of me.

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Are you going to cry?

26
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
If I don't cry, the skin of a human...

27
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
The skin of a human, right?

28
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
If I don't cry, the skin of a human, right?

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
You don't know the meaning, do you?

30
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
If I don't cry, the skin of a human...

31
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Turn the camera around!

32
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
It's okay, Hamada-san!

33
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I'm definitely going to cry!

34
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
This is the skin of a human!

35
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
A human?

36
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
A human!

37
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
But the size is different.

38
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
It's not a human.

39
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
You have to say something about the same size.

40
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
This is definitely not a human.

41
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
If I don't cry...

42
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
That's how moving it is.

43
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
That's how moving it is.

44
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Today, there are four of us and 25 staff members.

45
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
We're going to see if we're going to be moved or not.

46
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
After we're done, we're going to count.

47
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
We're going to think of a present for Hose-san

48
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
with the points from the counting.

49
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I think this is going to be the best.

50
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
If there are 5 people from 0, it's going to be this kind of product.

51
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
It's about 5 people.

52
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
It's about this much.

53
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
6 to 10.

54
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
This is it.

55
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
It's about this much.

56
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
We're a couple.

57
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
How about you, Aya-chan?

58
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
No, no, no.

59
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
From 11 to 15,

60
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
it's a bicycle for 3 people who can enjoy it with their children.

61
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
From 16 to 20,

62
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
it's a luxury product that's safe for the elderly.

63
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
From 21 to 24,

64
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
it's a luxurious chandelier.

65
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I don't need this.

66
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
It's a wonderful thing.

67
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I'm not going to give it to you!

68
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
And if it's perfect 24,

69
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
this is it!

70
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Wow!

71
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
This is amazing.

72
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Anywhere!

73
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
This is amazing.

74
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Anywhere in the world!

75
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
This is amazing.

76
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I'm going to eat it.

77
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Really?

78
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Yes.

79
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
You're going to pay for all of this?

80
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
This is amazing.

81
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I'm the only one who's going to pay for this.

82
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
It's similar.

83
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
This program is brought to you by these sponsors.

84
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Now, let's begin Yama-chan's happy wedding performance!

85
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I can't go down once, can I?

86
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:54,000
This is the ceremony, right?

87
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I, Seishi,

88
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
hereby announce the grand wedding of Izumo Oyashiro.

89
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I'm going to get married today.

90
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
We are going to perform a ceremony

91
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
in this shrine

92
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
where the newlyweds are going to get married.

93
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
From now on, we are going to pray to God.

94
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
What?

95
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
We are going to love each other.

96
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
No one's laughing so far.

97
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
We are going to dedicate this ceremony

98
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
to the newlyweds.

99
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Even Miko behind us is laughing.

100
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
We are going to pray.

101
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
No one's laughing at all.

102
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
On the 13th of Heisei,

103
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
It's like a skit.

104
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
on the 21st of October,

105
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
the husband, Hyosei Yamasaki.

106
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Wife, Aya.

107
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
She spoke.

108
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
She spoke.

109
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
She can speak.

110
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
She can't speak.

111
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:44,000
She can speak.

112
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:50,000
What is this?

113
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
This is like a wedding how-to video.

114
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
It's true.

115
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
What is this?

116
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
It's a very beautiful image.

117
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:11,000
If you play this in a song, it won't look like this.

118
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
It's a lie.

119
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
It's a lie.

120
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Where is this?

121
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
It's a lie.

122
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,000
It's a lie.

123
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Where is this?

124
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
It's a rare new bride.

125
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Why?

126
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Aya isn't crying that much.

127
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I'm not crying.

128
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I'm crying so I can't cry.

129
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
If you cry,

130
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
you'll have to cry.

131
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Why aren't you crying?

132
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:07,000
The bride and groom, please enter.

133
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
What is this?

134
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
This is where you cry, right?

135
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
This is where you cry, right?

136
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Yes.

137
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Why are you entering with this sound?

138
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Wow.

139
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:40,000
The umbrella role isn't working.

140
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Don't laugh.

141
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Now, we will begin the wedding ceremony of the Yamasaki family, the Ito family, and the Goryo family.

142
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Cameras, are you ready?

143
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Please enter the wedding cake.

144
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Congratulations.

145
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
He's laughing.

146
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
He's laughing.

147
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:23,000
The bride and groom, please enter the wedding cake.

148
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
What?

149
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
They're taking pictures of the umbrella.

150
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
That's what I thought.

151
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I'm impressed.

152
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Everyone on the right, please pay attention.

153
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
This is a photo of you two when you were little.

154
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Let's begin.

155
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I don't want to see it.

156
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
A genius comedian has arrived in Nishinomiya City, Hyogo Prefecture.

157
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
What do you think of this?

158
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Thank you.

159
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
At the bottom of the center,

160
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
there is a great symbol of a genius comedian.

161
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Wow.

162
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:09,000
It's so long.

163
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:18,000
This costume is enough.

164
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
He's laughing.

165
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
He's having fun.

166
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
It's so expensive.

167
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Who is this?

168
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Is he your friend?

169
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
No, he's my relative.

170
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Everyone, please give him a big round of applause.

171
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:47,000
The bride and groom, please enter the wedding cake.

172
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
The bride and groom, please enter the wedding cake.

173
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:57,000
The bride and groom, please enter the wedding cake.

174
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:06,000
What is this?

175
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I wanted to change my clothes.

176
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Congratulations.

177
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
This is strange.

178
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
What is this?

179
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
The bride and groom, please enter the wedding cake.

180
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
The bride and groom, please enter the wedding cake.

181
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I think you're a little different.

182
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
No, no.

183
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Is this okay?

184
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I'm scared.

185
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Again?

186
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
It's hard for me too.

187
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I'm a person who shot on the spot.

188
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:45,000
It's hard.

189
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:51,000
What is this?

190
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Who is this?

191
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Congratulations on your wedding.

192
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
The bride and groom, please enter the wedding cake.

193
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:04,000
The bride and groom, please enter the wedding cake.

194
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Look at this.

195
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
You can see it now.

196
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I was given this.

197
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I drew it when I was young.

198
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,000
And I forgot it someday.

199
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:40,000
It's like a dream.

200
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Why do you use this?

201
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,000
It doesn't matter.

202
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Dad, mom.

203
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Thank you for raising such a selfish child.

204
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
And mom.

205
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Until I met my current father.

206
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I've been a woman all my life.

207
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Our father.

208
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
He raised me.

209
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I'm going to cry.

210
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Mom, thank you for your hard work.

211
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:42,000
From now on, I will do my best as a mother and a baby.

212
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Mom.

213
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:56,000
From the bottom of my heart, I am a mother.

214
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Thank you very much.

215
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Hosei's father and mother.

216
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I will do my best as a daughter-in-law and a daughter-in-law.

217
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Thank you very much.

218
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Congratulations.

219
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Dad and mom, please give me a round of applause.

220
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:57,000
This is the end of the screening.

221
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I'm crying alone.

222
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Do you have any comments?

223
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I think it was a normal wedding screening.

224
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I don't know if you're impressed.

225
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:44,000
If you are impressed, turn on the switch.

226
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:49,000
It's zero.

227
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Zero?

228
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I didn't think it was zero.

229
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,000
There is a toilet paper.

230
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Unfortunately, it was zero.

231
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Really?

232
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I was a little impressed.

233
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:22,000
But if you cry, it will be broken.

234
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,000
It's hard.

235
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I want to give you a medicine box.

236
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I want to give you a medicine box.

237
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I want to give you a medicine box.

238
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Thank you very much.

239
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Please give me a round of applause.

240
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Congratulations on your 20th anniversary.

241
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I think this is a good thing.

242
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:22,000
There are only two cars in the front row.

243
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I'm about to cry.

244
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I want to give it to everyone.

245
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Why are there only two cars in the front row?

246
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I talked a lot about driving on TV.

247
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I don't want to talk about it.

248
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
But let me tell you this.

249
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:56,000
There are two cars in the front row.

250
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I'm going to go in from the front row.

251
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:10,000
The car next to me is going to turn left.

252
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
The car next to me is going to turn left.

253
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:18,000
So I can't go in from the front row.

254
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I wanted to go in between the white and black cars.

255
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Who are you paying attention to?

256
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
If you pay attention, it's me in the back.

257
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:35,000
The way you use the keys is strange.

258
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I'm tired of it.

259
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
There are three cars in the back row.

260
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
There are three cars in the back row.

261
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:49,000
There are three cars in the back row.

262
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
There are four cars in the back row.

263
00:16:52,000 --> 00:17:00,000
In fact, being the front seat is similar to me.

264
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:15,000
This time I went in between the two true car why I was given a space.

265
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:20,000
If you were the only person in the back row, you would have been the person in front of you.

266
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
That's right!

267
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
If that's the case...

268
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
This is a difficult topic.

269
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I want to turn everything upside down.

270
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I want to turn everything upside down with that Okonomiyaki thing.

271
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
With a slightly bigger one.

272
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Can I call it?

273
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
If you can go with a bigger one, I'd like you to go.

274
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I want to go. From the top, too.

275
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
You're this way.

276
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
You're this way.

277
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
This is also possible.

278
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
No, no, no.

279
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Why are you doing it this way?

280
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I want to do this, too.

281
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I want to do this with a smaller one.

282
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I want to do this with a smaller one.

283
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Like this.

284
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
It really makes me angry.

285
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I want you to stop running when you're in a traffic jam.

286
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
That's all I care about.

287
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
I'm the one who opens the gap.

288
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Even though I'm in a traffic jam.

289
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I'm right in front of him.

290
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I'm right in front of him.

291
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
It really makes me angry.

292
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
That's...

293
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
When I'm running away from him.

294
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I'm like, I'm going to get in trouble.

295
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I'm like that, but when I look at the number.

296
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
He's from the countryside.

297
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
He's from the countryside.

298
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
And I'm like, I'm going to get in trouble.

299
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I'm going to get in trouble.

300
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I'm like, I'm going to get in trouble.

301
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
You know the function of raising the seat, right?

302
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
You know that, right?

303
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,000
It's like this.

304
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I can't be a fool.

305
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I can't be a fool.

306
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
That's a chair.

307
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I can't do this.

308
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I can't be a fool.

309
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I can't be a fool.

310
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I want to put a big trailer on it.

311
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I want to crush everything.

312
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
That's not possible.

313
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
What?

314
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
I want to look at it from above.

315
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I want to look at it from above.

316
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
You're crazy.

317
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
You're crazy.

318
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
That's not possible.

319
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I want to look at it from above.

320
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
That's not possible.

321
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:19,000
This is a question for Matsumoto, the only athlete who can compete with Keiin Kosugi.

322
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Yes.

323
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
The three-stage jump is a hop, step, and jump.

324
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I heard that Matsumoto completed the first five-stage jump in human history.

325
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,000
In the case of a five-stage jump, what happens next?

326
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Yes.

327
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Actually, hop, step is English, right?

328
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Yes.

329
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
And then it becomes French.

330
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Hop, step, and then it becomes German.

331
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Hop, step, and then it becomes German.

332
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
That's not possible.

333
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
That's not possible.

334
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
What?

335
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Hop, step, and jump.

336
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Please explain the movement.

337
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
What is it?

338
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Please explain what happens when you say something.

339
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Otherwise, I don't understand.

340
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
It comes like this, right?

341
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
It's a hop, right?

342
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
It's the same here, right?

343
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
It's a step, right?

344
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Originally, it's a jump here.

345
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
It's a jump.

346
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
This is the end.

347
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
What comes next?

348
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Durban.

349
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
What?

350
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Durban.

351
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
When it comes to Durban, it's both legs.

352
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Durban.

353
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Durban.

354
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Durban.

355
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
And then it becomes Serre-Lego.

356
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I don't understand.

357
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
I don't understand.

358
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
I don't understand.

359
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
I don't understand this.

360
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Do you understand?

361
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
I don't understand this.

362
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Why don't you understand?

363
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
I don't understand what this means.

364
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
It becomes Serre-Lego, right?

365
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Ah, no.

366
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
No, no, no.

367
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Hop, step, Durban, Serre-Lego.

368
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Stop, stop, stop.

369
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Stop here.

370
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I can't stop.

371
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
I can't stop.

372
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
What comes next?

373
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
It becomes Serre-Lego.

374
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
And then?

375
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
What comes next?

376
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Serre-Lego.

377
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Serre-Lego.

378
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Durban.

379
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
What's that?

380
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
What's that at the end?

381
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
What's that?

382
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
It's a landing.

383
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
It's a landing.

384
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
What's that?

385
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
It's a Grand-Madiam.

386
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Grand-Madiam.

387
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Grand-Madiam.

388
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:28,000
And then, the 15cm distance between the front legs is recorded.

389
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
The 15cm distance between the front legs is recorded.

390
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
It's tiring to watch, isn't it?

391
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
It's tiring to do it, isn't it?

392
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Ah, sports is...

393
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
It's going to be a big deal.

394
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
But there's no one doing this, right?

395
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
That's right.

396
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
But there's no one doing this, right?

397
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
That's right.

398
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Eh, that's not true!

399
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
That's not true at all.

400
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
When I stand next to you, I always smell the good smell of shampoo.

401
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
I have a question for Matsumoto-san.

402
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
When you're shampooing, you feel something behind you.

403
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Who's behind you?

404
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Ah, I see.

405
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Yes, yes, yes.

406
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
This is something that even the UnBelievable hasn't done.

407
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
I see.

408
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
This is really like that.

409
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Do you feel it?

410
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Ah, well, it's like...

411
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Someone.

412
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
But I don't think there's anything to be afraid of.

413
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Is that so?

414
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Yes.

415
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
It's not a bad example.

416
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
How do you know that?

417
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
I don't know if it's a bad example.

418
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
No, no, no.

419
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,000
In short, when you're shampooing, the feeling that's behind you is...

420
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:45,000
It's the linseed.

421
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
What do you mean?

422
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Eh?

423
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
I'm the next one, right?

424
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Yes, yes, yes.

425
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
It's the linseed scent.

426
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Hurry up and put it on.

427
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
The next one is me, right?

428
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
The scent of the linseed is...

429
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Hurry up and put me on like that.

430
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
I'm really used to scalp.

431
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Eh?

432
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
You're looking at me like that?

433
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
You're really behind.

434
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
If that's the case...

435
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
You're really looking at me from behind, right?

436
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
I'm really looking at you.

437
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
But that's not a bad example at all.

438
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Ah, is that so?

439
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Everyone's a little scared, right?

440
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
I'm scared.

441
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
I can't believe you're wearing a linseed.

442
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,000
But what you have to be careful about is that when you suddenly linseed...

443
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,000
This shampoo's grudge is scary.

444
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
I jumped over it and said it was linseed.

445
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
It's me, isn't it linseed?

446
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
That's what it is.

447
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
This shampoo's...

448
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
This female cat!

449
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Thief cat!

450
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
That's not for you.

451
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
It's for the linseed.

452
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:10,000
You have a young body!

453
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,000
What are you trying to say?

454
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:30,000
