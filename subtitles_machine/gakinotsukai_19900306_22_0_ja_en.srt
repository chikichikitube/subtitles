1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,500
Let's buy a lot of Chikitsuki at the first Gaki no Tsukai line!

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,500
What is Chikitsuki?

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:10,500
If you turn this paper over, you can definitely race in a tricycle.

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:11,500
There is no doubt.

5
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:13,500
Today, from this Kinshicho.

6
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,000
I'm glad to see you again.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Let's buy a lot of Chikitsuki at the opening today.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'll give you a cheema.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Yes.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
10,000 yen.

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Take this 10,000 yen and buy 10 kg of things.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Buy 10 kg of things?

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Yes, 10,000 yen.

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I wonder if there is a woman of 10 kg.

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
It doesn't mean that.

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Let's buy a lot of Chikitsuki!

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Start!

18
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Let's go!

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:57,000
There are a lot of things here.

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
How many kg is this?

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
How many kg is this?

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
How many kg is this?

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
What are you talking about?

24
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
It's 10,000 yen!

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
What is this?

26
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Can you sell this for 10,000 yen?

27
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:32,000
There is a frog on the front, right?

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Can you sell that for 10,000 yen?

29
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
This frog.

30
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
No, it's not for sale.

31
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
It's not for sale?

32
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
It's not for sale.

33
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:49,000
It's not for sale.

34
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Where did the toy shop go?

35
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Takoyaki is also good.

36
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I don't even have 300 yen.

37
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I'll take a picture of your lonely back.

38
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
You are late.

39
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
What?

40
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
You are late.

41
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:44,000
You said 15 minutes, but it took 30 minutes.

42
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
This program is brought to you by

43
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Sanraku

44
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Oyama International Products

45
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
and the sponsor of this program.

46
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
10 kg for 10,000 yen.

47
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:11,000
What did you buy?

48
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:17,000
What is this?

49
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I bought a tempura of squid.

50
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
You are over 10,000 yen.

51
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Do you have a change?

52
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
A change?

53
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
5,000 yen.

54
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Why do you have so much money?

55
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
What is it?

56
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
10,000 yen.

57
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I thought it would be better to have a lot of money.

58
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Do you have a receipt?

59
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I don't have it.

60
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
You can't.

61
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Why?

62
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
You can't get a receipt on Japanese TV.

63
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Why?

64
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
You don't have it.

65
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
You bought it yourself.

66
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I like it very much.

67
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Really?

68
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
What is it?

69
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Cat sand.

70
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
It's a plush toy.

71
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
You don't need it.

72
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Why?

73
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I'll go.

74
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Shrimp tempura.

75
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:17,000
It's an expensive thing.

76
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
What is it?

77
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Cat sand.

78
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I bought this.

79
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
What is it?

80
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Peach tree.

81
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
What?

82
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Peach tree.

83
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I bought it for a sponsor.

84
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
But I still have money left.

85
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,000
So I bought this from my sponsor, Sanraku.

86
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I bought this one.

87
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I have 40 yen left.

88
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Do you want to use this?

89
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
It's a snack.

90
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
It's good, isn't it?

91
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I lost 10 yen.

92
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Stop it.

93
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
You can't move it.

94
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I don't know why I was late.

95
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
But this guy suddenly asked me.

96
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
It's a Japanese horse.

97
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I can't catch it.

98
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
A Japanese horse?

99
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
It's a Japanese horse.

100
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
It's hard to catch it.

101
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
You can't move it.

102
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I'm serious.

103
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
You can't move it.

104
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Wait a minute.

105
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
It's 100 kg.

106
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
It's 10 kg.

107
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
It's 10 kg.

108
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
It's up to here.

109
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
How much does it weigh?

110
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
It feels good.

111
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
It's 7.5 kg.

112
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
It's 9.5 kg.

113
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Wait a minute.

114
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
You can't move it.

115
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
It's 9.5 kg.

116
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
It's a snack.

117
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
It's a dry gun.

118
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I don't need it.

119
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
It's going to hit you.

120
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
It might hit me.

121
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Do you want to try it?

122
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Don't step on it.

123
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
It's 10 kg.

124
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:49,000
It's 10 kg.

125
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,000
It's the worst to weigh more than 10 kg.

126
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I weigh more than 10 kg.

127
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Don't throw it away.

128
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Here we go.

129
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:07,000
It's not heavy at all.

130
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Look.

131
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
What?

132
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
It's 6 kg.

133
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:19,000
It's a big deal.

134
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Here we go.

135
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
All right.

136
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Look.

137
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
It's not heavy at all.

138
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
It's heavy.

139
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
It's going somewhere.

140
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
It hurts.

141
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
It's not going to work anymore.

142
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
It's 10 kg.

143
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I wish I only had two of these.

144
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
My face is so heavy.

145
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Look.

146
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
It's heavy.

147
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
My weight is 11kg.

148
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
That means I win.

149
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
It says 5kg.

150
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
You are 11kg and I am 10kg.

151
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I ate fish on the way here.

152
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Fish?

153
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
My stomach is full.

154
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I want to win.

155
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Thank you very much.

156
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Rocking!

157
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
It has started.

158
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
This is the second video of Nihon-dori.

159
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
You know the opening song.

160
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I am a little tired.

161
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
The audience is changing.

162
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
It is the first time to see the audience.

163
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
What is wrong with you?

164
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:01,000
There are people who come to watch this program and those who do not.

165
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
That is not true.

166
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Please tell them that the paper has been published.

167
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
What are the rest of the people?

168
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I do not know.

169
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I want to see it.

170
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Come to see it.

171
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I do not recognize downtown as a comedian.

172
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I am a fan of Utopia.

173
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
You are off work now.

174
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I have to make people laugh.

175
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
What do people think when they come home?

176
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
They say it was funny.

177
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I have a microphone.

178
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I want to hear it.

179
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I put it in the audience's seat.

180
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
What is this?

181
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I put it in the back of the microphone.

182
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,000
It was more boring than I thought.

183
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Why did you kick it?

184
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I do not know.

185
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I do not know if it was funny.

186
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
What is this?

187
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I came to Tokyo.

188
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I am used to it.

189
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I am used to it.

190
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
There was an earthquake the other day.

191
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
It was about 4 degrees.

192
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Do not you know?

193
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
It is...

194
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
That's right.

195
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
The earthquake in Tokyo is normal.

196
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I am used to it.

197
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
It's nothing.

198
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
There is no earthquake in Osaka.

199
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
There is no earthquake.

200
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
There is no earthquake in Osaka.

201
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,400
When we were having a party, everyone was screaming,

202
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,400
and I was like, are you shaking?

203
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,400
What kind of a person are you?

204
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,800
Well, Osaka people aren't used to that kind of thing.

205
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,800
That's true, it was a long time.

206
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,800
It was a long time.

207
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,800
And it was big.

208
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:21,800
I thought there was a big difference between the people of Tokyo and Osaka.

209
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,800
I wonder if the people of Tokyo,

210
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,800
in the earthquake,

211
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,800
took advantage of the shaking and went to sleep.

212
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,800
There's that kind of thing, right?

213
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,800
I'm not an old man.

214
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,800
I'm not an old man.

215
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,800
I wonder if the people of Tokyo have guts.

216
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,800
What is it?

217
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,800
I don't know.

218
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,800
I think there's a saying,

219
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,800
the taste of Tokyo is stupid.

220
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:46,800
You eat it looking delicious, right?

221
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,800
I eat anything looking delicious.

222
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,800
Even if it's a thick udon,

223
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,800
I eat it like, haaa.

224
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,800
Even if it's a black udon.

225
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,800
That part is a little...

226
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,800
It's black, right?

227
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,800
I think it's a little strange.

228
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:06,800
Tokyo people and Osaka people still have a long way to go.

229
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,800
If you use Osaka dialect,

230
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,800
everyone thinks it's a manzai.

231
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,800
That's it.

232
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,800
If you go from Tokyo to Osaka to play,

233
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,800
and take the train,

234
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,800
Osaka people just talk normally.

235
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,800
They say, something happened the other day.

236
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,800
They say it's like a manzai.

237
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:29,800
Even when I used to work in Tokyo,

238
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:32,800
I didn't know anyone like that.

239
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,800
But when I went somewhere,

240
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,800
they said it's like a manzai.

241
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,800
It's a manzai, though.

242
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,800
Let's go to Haragi.

243
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,800
Let's go to Haragi.

244
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,800
Let's go to Haragi.

245
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,800
Let's go to Haragi.

246
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,800
Let's go to Haragi.

247
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,800
Let's go to Haragi.

248
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,800
Let's go to Haragi.

249
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,800
Huh?

250
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,800
You're pretty good.

251
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,800
I want to take a picture.

252
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,800
I took it before.

253
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,800
What are you doing?

254
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,800
Who told you to take a picture?

255
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,800
I'll give it to you later.

256
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,800
I took a picture.

257
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,800
It's not bad.

258
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,800
Let me introduce you.

259
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,800
This is Odawara, who loves matcha.

260
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,800
It's a little strange.

261
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:23,800
There's something I've been wanting to talk about.

262
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,800
It's about Matcha's real name.

263
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,800
My friend told me that

264
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,800
Matcha's name is Yukinojo.

265
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,800
At first, I didn't believe it.

266
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,800
But in the TV series,

267
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,800
Ran-chan called Matcha Yukinojo-niisan.

268
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,800
I think it's true.

269
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,800
I want you to hear it from Matcha's mouth.

270
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,800
Do you think I'm Yukinojo?

271
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,800
Huh?

272
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,800
My name is...

273
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,800
My name is...

274
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,800
What is it?

275
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,800
My name is Hitoshi Matsumoto.

276
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,800
What is it?

277
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,800
What is it?

278
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,800
Again, you...

279
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,800
I'm Hitoshi Matsumoto.

280
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,800
I'm a parent.

281
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,800
I'm a parent.

282
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,800
I'm a parent.

283
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,800
I'm a parent.

284
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,800
I'm a parent.

285
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,800
You may have a child.

286
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,800
You may have a child.

287
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,800
I don't know.

288
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,800
I don't know.

289
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,800
If you give me a name, I won't give it to you.

290
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,800
I don't like it.

291
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,800
I don't like it.

292
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,800
I don't like it.

293
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,800
Your name...

294
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,800
I saw you on TV in Osaka.

295
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,800
I asked you to give me a name.

296
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,800
You said, Dokuro Nisei.

297
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,800
I asked you to give me a name.

298
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,800
Is there such a name?

299
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,800
You said, Dokuro Nisei.

300
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,800
I asked you to give me a name.

301
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,800
Is there such a name?

302
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,800
Like, Cantama.

303
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,800
Cantama...

304
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,800
I'm serious.

305
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,800
I'm serious.

306
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,800
I don't like it.

307
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,800
Why do you say such a thing?

308
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,800
I want to give you a name.

309
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,800
I want to give you a name.

310
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,800
I'll recruit you in this program.

311
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,800
Let's play with your child.

312
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,800
What?

313
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:18,800
Let's go this way.

314
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,800
Pen name...

315
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,800
What is this?

316
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:22,800
Mary Fuji.

317
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,800
Good evening, two brothers of Mamushi.

318
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,800
Good evening.

319
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,800
Mr. Hamada went to a high school in Zenryosei.

320
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,800
Moreover, he went to Fukuryocho.

321
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,800
Did you have any big event in your mind?

322
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:36,800
I was living in a dormitory.

323
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:37,800
That's right.

324
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,800
I want you to listen to the story of that time.

325
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,800
This is something you can't experience.

326
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,800
Living in a dormitory in high school.

327
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,800
Have you ever run away?

328
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:48,800
I hate it.

329
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,800
You are really bad-tempered.

330
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,800
I didn't run away.

331
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,800
I couldn't go home when I had to go home.

332
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:55,800
I hate it.

333
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,800
I woke up at 4.30 in the morning.

334
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,800
Didn't you run away?

335
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:02,800
No, I didn't.

336
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,800
Then why didn't you come to my house to get money?

337
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,800
Why is it so hard to live in a dormitory?

338
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,800
I woke up at 4.30 in the morning.

339
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,800
It was dark.

340
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,800
I was on the top of the mountain.

341
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:18,800
It was below zero.

342
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,800
It was below zero.

343
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,800
It was below zero.

344
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,800
I opened the refrigerator.

345
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:33,800
It was as cold as the temperature inside the refrigerator.

346
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,800
You woke up at 4.30 in the morning,

347
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,800
put on your jersey and cleaned the room.

348
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,800
If I had studied a little more in junior high school,

349
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,800
I would have been able to go to a normal school.

350
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:47,800
Normal?

351
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:49,800
That's why your parents...

352
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,800
You were abandoned by your teachers.

353
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,800
You were abandoned by your teachers in junior high school.

354
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,800
The teachers who guided you on your path

355
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,800
said, where should we decide?

356
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,800
Should we make it a straight line?

357
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,800
You can accept the efficiency here,

358
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,800
but if you make it a flat surface,

359
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,800
you can stop it from slipping.

360
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,800
When I was wondering,

361
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,800
he didn't say anything.

362
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:12,800
He did.

363
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,800
I talked about it properly.

364
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:16,800
It's over.

365
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:20,800
When everyone was talking about their path,

366
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,800
his teacher came and said,

367
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:23,800
Hamada,

368
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,800
this is about school.

369
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,800
What are you going to do?

370
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,800
Are you going to work?

371
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,800
Are you going to get a job?

372
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,800
Hamada said something.

373
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,800
I don't know what he said.

374
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,800
It's not a story I made up.

375
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,800
Hamada came and said,

376
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,800
Hamada, are you brushing your teeth?

377
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,800
Everyone was like,

378
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,800
when are you going to sit down?

379
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,800
It's yellow here.

380
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,800
I was told that,

381
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,800
Hamada,

382
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:59,800
I've been thinking about you for a long time.

383
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:02,800
You should think about me first.

384
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,800
This is from Gunma.

385
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:08,800
We did a survey last time.

386
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,800
The target is,

387
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,800
downtown, B21 special,

388
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:13,800
Uchan Nanchan.

389
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,800
The target is these members.

390
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,800
If you make them your lover,

391
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,800
1st place, Uchimura Mitsuyoshi.

392
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:20,800
I know.

393
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,800
I know.

394
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,800
Why?

395
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,800
I know.

396
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,800
I know.

397
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,800
What?

398
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,800
2nd place.

399
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,800
I watch this every week.

400
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,800
You watch it every week.

401
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,800
1st place, Uchimura Teruyoshi.

402
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,800
2nd place, Matsumoto Hitoshi.

403
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,800
You guys are honest.

404
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,800
You guys are honest.

405
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,800
3rd place, Hiromi.

406
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,800
I don't like it.

407
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,800
4th place, Chin.

408
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,800
What about me?

409
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,800
5th place, David.

410
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:01,800
What about me?

411
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,800
There is no one below.

412
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:06,800
So,

413
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,800
Nanchan and Hamada are not included.

414
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,800
If you make them your lover.

415
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:11,800
I see.

416
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,800
I'll look forward to the next one.

417
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:14,800
Please look forward to the next one.

418
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,800
Chinpira looks good on you.

419
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,800
Liar.

420
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,800
It's true.

421
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,800
It's true.

422
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,800
1st place, Hamada Mitsuyoshi.

423
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,800
I did it.

424
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,800
I did it.

425
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:29,800
And,

426
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,800
Hiromi, Nanchan, me.

427
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,800
They are included.

428
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,800
And, who has a good personality?

429
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,800
Yes.

430
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,800
1st place, Uchimura Teruyoshi.

431
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,800
I don't like it.

432
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:44,800
Is that so?

433
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:45,800
2nd place,

434
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:48,800
Matsumoto Hitoshi.

435
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:52,800
That's not true.

436
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,800
That's not true.

437
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,800
Chin is also included.

438
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,800
I know Chin.

439
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,800
Chin has a good personality.

440
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,800
Right?

441
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,800
Why are you 2nd place?

442
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,800
Are you weird?

443
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:09,800
Did you write it?

444
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:12,800
Did you see my bad personality?

445
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:13,800
What?

446
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:16,800
What?

447
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,800
I'll tell you a story.

448
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,800
Every month,

449
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,800
Every month,

450
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,800
I send money to my parents' house.

451
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:27,800
Of course.

452
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:32,800
If you earn a lot, you will send money.

453
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:33,800
Do you send money?

454
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:34,800
Of course.

455
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,800
What are you talking about?

456
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:37,800
How much do you send?

457
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,800
I don't care about money.

458
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:42,800
I don't care about money.

459
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:43,800
What about 3rd place?

460
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,800
3rd place is David.

461
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:46,800
He has a good personality.

462
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,800
That's right.

463
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:56,800
And, he has a bad personality.

464
00:19:56,800 --> 00:20:00,800
1st place, Hiromi.

465
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,800
I know it.

466
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:03,800
We are together.

467
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,800
2nd place,

468
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:08,800
Hamada Masatoshi.

469
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:09,800
I applaud you.

470
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:12,800
3rd place, Kiyotaka Nambara.

471
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:13,800
I don't care about money.

472
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:14,800
Why?

473
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:17,800
I don't care about money.

474
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,800
What?

475
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:22,800
I want to ask you a proper questionnaire.

476
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:23,800
Really?

477
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:24,800
Yes.

478
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,800
I want a proper questionnaire.

479
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,800
You guys do it.

480
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:30,800
Osaka people are amazing.

481
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:34,800
In a TV program, there were 50 people who pressed the switch.

482
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:35,800
Yes.

483
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:36,800
When we did that,

484
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:37,800
We did a thorough investigation.

485
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,800
Yes.

486
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:44,800
There were about 35 people out of 50 who wanted to have sex with me.

487
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:52,800
There were about 35 people out of 50 who wanted to have sex with me.

488
00:20:52,800 --> 00:21:02,800
There were about 35 people out of 50 who wanted to have sex with me.

489
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:05,800
Let's do it in a TV program.

490
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,800
It will cost a little money.

491
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:10,800
Let's do a thorough investigation.

492
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:11,800
I want to ask you a lot of questions.

493
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:12,800
I want to ask you a lot of questions.

494
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:15,800
There is an adult video.

495
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:18,800
If it is 1 million yen, can I appear in it?

496
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:21,800
There were about 10 people.

497
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:25,800
If it is 2 million, I can't appear.

498
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:28,800
I want to ask if it is money.

499
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:34,800
I want to ask you to do a costume for the grand prize.

500
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,800
We can do a costume.

501
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:37,800
Thank you.

502
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,800
We will go to the audition.

503
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:40,800
Yes.

504
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,800
We will go to the audition.

505
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:46,800
We will participate in the bird contest.

506
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:47,800
I will fly in a plane.

507
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:48,800
Of course, I'll fly.

508
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:49,800
Of course, you'll fly.

509
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,800
No wonder, this girl is called P-chan.

510
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:52,800
It's okay.

511
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,800
Well, that's all for tonight.

512
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:57,800
That's all for tonight.

513
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:58,800
Yes.

514
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,800
Thank you very much, everyone.

515
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,800
Well, it was difficult, wasn't it?

516
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,800
It was difficult, wasn't it?

517
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:09,800
What?

518
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:10,800
What?

519
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:11,800
What?

520
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:12,800
Ah, shopping, right?

521
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,800
That's right.

522
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:22,800
But, if you want to spend 10,000 yen in 15 minutes, it's difficult even if you say it's expensive.

523
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:28,800
Well, you bought a stuffed cat, didn't you?

524
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:29,800
I bought it.

525
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,800
You bought it, didn't you?

526
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,800
That...

527
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,800
I'm lucky.

528
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,800
You bought it again, didn't you?

529
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:38,800
That's for the viewers of the TV.

530
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:39,800
That's for the viewers of the TV.

531
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:40,800
That's for the viewers of the TV.

532
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,800
That's for the viewers of the TV.

533
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:45,800
If you want it, I'll think about the program.

534
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:48,800
Because you're always asking for something like that.

535
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:51,800
I said my name.

536
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,800
What about the sand? The cat sand?

537
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,800
The cat sand...

538
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,800
Well, I don't know what to do.

539
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:00,800
Well, if you want it, it's okay.

540
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:01,800
Yes.

541
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:04,800
But, it costs money to send it.

542
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:05,800
Well, I don't know what to do.

543
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:06,800
Well, I don't know what to do.

544
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:08,800
Hey.

545
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:11,800
lt's...

546
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,800
l want to hold his hand.

547
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:16,800
This...

548
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:25,800
I received the advice from my advisor,

549
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:31,800
He thought about an idea and made decisions.

550
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:34,800
He thought about an idea and made decisions.

551
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:37,800
He thought about an idea and made decisions.

552
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:40,800
I'm looking forward to it.
