40
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,000
So if you have a parasol you can stay in the sun for a long time.

41
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I see.

42
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
But if you have a parasol you can stay in the sun for a long time.

43
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
But if you have a parasol you can stay in the sun for a long time.

44
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
So you don't know what it is.

45
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
What is a parasol?

46
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I think you should move the chair.

47
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
No, you shouldn't.

48
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
The place is already decided.

49
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
If you move the chair, it will fly away.

50
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
It will fly away like this.

51
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
But you have 5,000 yen, right?

52
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Yes, I do.

53
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
That's why I don't have that much.

54
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
It's the oasis of the city.

55
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
To be honest, I have money.

56
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
You have money?

57
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I have a lot of money in my house.

58
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
What does it have to do with money?

59
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I want to be a thief.

60
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I want to be a thief.

61
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
He is a fool.

62
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I want you to take money from me.

63
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
That's what I think.

64
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
That's expensive.

65
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Yes, it is.

66
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Really?

67
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I went to the pool and thought about it.

68
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I thought that downtown was not a good place for children.

69
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
That's sad.

70
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I've been thinking about it.

71
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
That's a lie.

72
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
What is it?

73
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I think you're the one who...

74
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Wait, wait.

75
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I thought it was a picture of a car.

76
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
What is it?

77
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
It has nothing to do with it.

78
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
When I was a kid, I thought it was a picture of a car.

79
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
What is it?

80
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
It's a picture of a car.

81
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
It's a picture of a car.

82
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
It's a picture of a car.

83
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
It's a lie.

84
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
It was really amazing.

85
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:36,000
There were four boys in the pool.

86
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Was he a good boy?

87
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I don't know if he was a good boy.

88
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
He said,

89
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Ma-chan, play with me.

90
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
He is a child with bad taste.

91
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
No, no, no.

92
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I like children, too.

93
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I asked him what he was doing.

94
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
He said,

95
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I'll run away, so you just have to catch me.

96
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I'll run away, so you just have to catch me.

97
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I'll run away, so you just have to catch me.

98
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I'll catch you.

99
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,000
He was screaming.

100
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I'm sure it's a lie.

101
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
He was screaming, too.

102
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
It was too long, and he was becoming an old man.

103
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I don't like it.

104
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I don't know.

105
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Well, it's okay.

106
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Ha...

107
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Huh?

108
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
He ran quite hard with his left foot.

109
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I don't think he came down.

110
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Now?

111
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
You can just step on it

112
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Don't talk like that

113
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
It's disgusting

114
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
What are you talking about?

115
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Kazumoto-san

116
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Yes

117
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Why do F1 racers

118
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
When they are in the pit and want to change tires

119
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Don't they try to finish the race

120
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
They don't try to finish the race

121
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
That's right, when they are in the pit they just sit

122
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
They don't even want to get off

123
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Isn't that fine?

124
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Then you should have done it earlier

125
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
You should have done it earlier

126
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Yes, yes

127
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
You should have done it earlier

128
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Ah, that's how it is

129
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
They work with their lives on the line

130
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
They are fighting in a world where they don't have a soul

131
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
In that kind of situation

132
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,000
There is a great sense of movement in their bodies

133
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Do you understand?

134
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Do you understand that?

135
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
If you don't understand then it's fine

136
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I do understand

137
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I do understand

138
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
What are you talking about?

139
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Ah, really?

140
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
If you don't understand that then I'll go on

141
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Yes, yes

142
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,000
After all, their bodies are very hard

143
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
No matter what

144
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Do you understand?

145
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Yes

146
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
If you don't understand then I'll go on

147
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Yes

148
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
If you don't understand then I'll go on

149
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,000
After all, you can see that their claws are getting longer

150
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
That's because they have been running for weeks

151
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
No, no, they want to go, they want to go

152
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
What do you mean they want to go?

153
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
They want to work harder

154
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
They are being pushed into something amazing

155
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Their claws and hair are getting longer

156
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
When they arrive they are getting longer

157
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
They are curious about that

158
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
So they go behind them and bite

159
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
So you shouldn't move too much

160
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Let me say this clearly

161
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I want to give them a little more time

162
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I want to give them time

163
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I want to give them a little bit of time to play

164
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
You should have told me when I read this

165
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
You should have told me when I read this

166
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I'm listening

167
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Are you going to end it?

168
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Wait a minute

169
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I understand

170
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I'll say it next

171
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Yes, yes

172
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I'll say it next

173
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Matsumoto-san is good at fighting

174
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I can say this

175
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:29,000
If a person who is beaten up like a piece of junk gets beaten up even more, how would you describe it?

176
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
A man, especially a man

177
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
You might see a man like that somewhere

178
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
You might see a man like that somewhere

179
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
But for me, it's my spirit

180
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
My spirit is something that exists for me

181
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
In words

182
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
In words

183
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I have seen a man who is beaten up like a piece of junk

184
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I see

185
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
But normally when a man is beaten up like a piece of junk, he loses his spirit and stops

186
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
But in my case, I have more spirit than that

187
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
So even if I get flustered, I still go

188
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I see

189
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
That's why I was beaten up like a piece of junk

190
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
That's why I have seen a man who is beaten up like a piece of junk

191
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
So how should I describe it?

192
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
You can say it

193
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
What?

194
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
So how should I describe it?

195
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
You can say it

196
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
You can say it

197
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
You have to take a shit while you are talking

198
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Please tell us

199
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
More than a piece of junk

200
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
More than a piece of junk?

201
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Do you know what a piece of junk means?

202
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Like a piece of organ

203
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Yes, organ, like a face

204
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
That's what it means

205
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
It's more than that

206
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
More than that, it means

207
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Acetate.

208
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
He's acting like he's acetate.

209
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
And on top of that...

210
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
There's more on top of that.

211
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
And on top of that, there's Leon.

212
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I feel like I'm going to lose.

213
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
That's how it goes.

214
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
And on top of that, there's Polypillepillone.

215
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
And what's even worse is that...

216
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
In the morning, he's 20 and his face is 80.

217
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I can't believe he's 80.

218
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
He's caught and beaten up.

219
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
And his face is 20 and his back is 80.

220
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Humanity has a history of 4000 years.

221
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
There are still five different ways of swimming.

222
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
There are still five different ways of swimming.

223
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
The only person who can think of the sixth way is Matsunosu.

224
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Please, teach me.

225
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Please, teach me.

226
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
What's a crawl?

227
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Swimming backwards.

228
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Swimming backwards.

229
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Butterfly.

230
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Dog swimming.

231
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
There's one more.

232
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
There's one more.

233
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Let's do this one too.

234
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Are you going to show me?

235
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Sure.

236
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Stop that!

237
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Let's go!

238
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Are you ready?

239
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
On your mark, get set, go!

240
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Here we go.

241
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:30,000
On your mark, get set, go!

242
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I'm being introduced.

243
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Wait a minute.

244
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Can you do this?

245
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I'm not doing this for no reason.

246
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Explain.

247
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Look at this.

248
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I'm sending the next water here.

249
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I'm sending the next water here.

250
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I'm sending the next water here.

251
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I'm sending the next water here.

252
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I'm sending the next water here.

253
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
What's happening to the legs in the water?

254
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
You were doing this.

255
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
What's happening to the legs in the water?

256
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
It's like this.

257
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
It's like this.

258
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I'm not swimming!

259
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,000
You just sent the next water.

260
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I'm sending the next water here.

261
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I'm walking, I'm not walking.

262
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
It's not floating. It's going into the water.

263
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
What do you mean by going into the water?

264
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Water of the future.

265
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Water of the future, water of the past.

266
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Water of the future, water of the past.

267
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
It's amazing. Water of the future, water of the past.

268
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Water of the future, water of the past.

269
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
You can breathe easily.

270
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Is your face showing?

271
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
It's showing. What are you talking about?

272
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
If it's not showing, then you should say,

273
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Water of the future, water of the past.

274
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
You shouldn't say that.

275
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
You shouldn't say that.

276
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
You should say that.

277
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
You shouldn't swim.

278
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
That's because you're strong in the sea.

279
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Why?

280
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
You can't put your feet on the ground.

281
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
You can't put your feet on the ground.

282
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
When you do this, you'll be surrounded by squids.

283
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Water of the past, water of the future,

284
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Water of the future, water of the past.

285
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Water of the future, water of the past.

286
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
That's right.

287
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:18,000
That's right.
