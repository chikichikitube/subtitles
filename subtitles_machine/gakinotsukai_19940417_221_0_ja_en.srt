This segment, you won't be able to see it on air.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
If you come here, you'll be lucky.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000

00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
This is my show, so I can't make it any more interesting.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
What are you talking about?

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I'm not going to risk my life to work today.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Yes, understood.

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Why don't you choose your job?

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Watanabe Marina-san!

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Watanabe Marina-san!

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000

This program is brought to you by the following sponsors.

26
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
The first is this!

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Ta-da!

28
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Your mother is calling you by your nickname!

29
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Do you want to do something at home?

30
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
What is it?

31
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Are you okay?

32
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
No, I'm not okay.

33
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Please write it down!

34
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Do you want to do something at home?

35
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Do you want your mother to call you by your nickname?

36
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Isn't that obvious?

37
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Isn't that you?

38
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Hurry up!

39
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Otate-san, please write it down.

40
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Don!

41
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Minamon!

42
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
What is it called?

43
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Monta-chan!

44
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Marina!

45
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I don't know.

46
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I don't know, but I think it's something like this.

47
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Matsumoto-san!

48
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Well...

49
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
It's Ducchan.

50
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
It's different from the one I've seen before!

51
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Ducchan's actions are like that.

52
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Kusanosiro-san.

53
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000

Kusanosiro-san.

56
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Tatashima brothers.

57
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000

Kanda Masaki.

60
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Kanda Masaki-san.

61
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Otake Makoto.

62
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Matsumoto-san.

00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Kanda Masaki?

00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Kanda Masaki-san won the Grand Prix!

70
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Everyone out!

71
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I was called Mako-chan the other day.

72
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Next is this!

73
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Have you ever been caught in a car accident?

74
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
You don't need to know this.

75
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Please think about it.

76
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Is it a woman?

77
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
It's only for women.

78
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
What?

79
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
What do you mean I'm Tama's running guy?

80
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Do you understand?

81
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
In a sense, if it's a male version, it's correct.

82
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
In a sense, if it's a female version, it's correct.

83
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I would never do it.

84
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
That's a lie.

85
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Are you serious?

86
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Let's move on.

87
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I don't think it's true.

88
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I've been to a check-up.

89
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
It's like, it's a lie.

90
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
It's a lie.

91
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I'm scared to accept it.

92
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
If you say something like, it's not true,

93
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I'll laugh my ass off.

94
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
If you say something like, it's not true,

95
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I'll laugh my ass off.

96
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
The next one is Marina's.

97
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I can accept it.

98
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Please don't say it.

99
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Even if it doesn't appear here, I think it's true.

100
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:51,000
It's a lie.

101
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
That's why I came here today.

102
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
It's really not true.

103
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I don't know such a thing.

104
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
What do you mean?

105
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
What do you mean?

106
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I don't think it's true.

107
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
What do you think?

108
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
The last one.

109
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I don't know, but it's Azuma's.

110
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
It's a harsh line.

111
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I don't think it's true.

112
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Wait a minute.

113
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
What if the camera is off?

114
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
What if the camera is surprised?

115
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I'm scared.

116
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Naomo Yozawa.

117
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Akiko Matsumoto.

118
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Akiko Matsumoto.

119
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Akiko Matsumoto.

120
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Masami Kisamoto.

121
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Fumi.

122
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I think I can eat anything.

123
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Hikaru Ishida.

124
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Shizuka Kudo.

125
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Akiko Matsumoto.

126
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Shizuka Kudo.

127
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
There was such a rumor.

128
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Everyone is wrong.

129
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
You said there was a rumor.

130
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
There was such a rumor.

131
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
What kind of rumor is that?

132
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Then here it is.

133
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
You're out of school.

134
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
You're only out of elementary school.

135
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Everyone is wrong.

136
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
You said you were going to school.

137
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
What are you laughing at?

138
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
This is the worst.

139
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
What do you think I said?

140
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
What did you say?

141
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I know.

142
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
You wanted to be on this show, didn't you?

143
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Let's start with Nago-chan.

144
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I'm going to guess this.

145
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
This is an image.

146
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Toga-chan.

147
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Marina.

148
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
This is the image of Otake-san.

149
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
What are you talking about?

150
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Matsumoto-san.

151
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Adachi Yu.

152
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
You're just like that.

153
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
If it's like that, you can eat as much as you want.

154
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
This is wrong.

155
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
This is the image of the Kuroa brothers.

156
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
This is a little funny.

157
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
This is the image that everyone has seen on TV.

158
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Jimmy Onishi-san.

159
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Hosokawa Fumie.

160
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Iijimai.

161
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Komoto Natsuki.

162
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Nozawa Naoko.

163
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Jimmy Onishi.

164
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Komoto Natsuki.

165
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Nozawa Naoko.

166
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
It's stupid to do things like this.

167
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Komoto Natsuki.

168
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Iijimai.

169
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
It's funny.

170
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
This is the image that everyone has seen on TV.

171
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Everyone is wrong.

172
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
The next question is this.

173
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
You eat eight meals a day, right?

174
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Wait a minute.

175
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Don't watch TV.

176
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
It's hot.

177
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
This is the image that everyone has seen on TV.

178
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Please don't say that.

179
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
What is it?

180
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
When I write something, it looks like I'm writing something bad.

181
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
This is the image of Tama.

182
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
This is the image of Tama.

183
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
This is the image of the All-Mighty Joker.

184
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:46,000
This is the image that everyone has seen on TV.

185
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
You are wonderful.

186
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
This is the image of MAKO.

187
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
This is the image of MAKO.

188
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
What are you talking about?

189
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
This is the image of KUN.

190
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
This is the image of MARINA.

191
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
This is the image of MARINA.

192
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I really thought of this.

193
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I thought of this.

194
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I thought of this.

195
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I thought of this.

196
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
You didn't say it.

197
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
This is the image of MADOMO.

198
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I don't know the name.

199
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
This is the image of the comedian club.

200
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,000
This is the image of the comedian club.

201
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
This was a video shot after pandemonium.

202
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,480
List of mankind's 5 13 creatures

203
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Matsumura Kunihiro

204
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Wada Akiko

205
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,340
It seems like it's eating by body.

206
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:45,340
Matsumura Kunihiro

207
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Wada Akiko

208
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:47,660
Takagi-P

209
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Yamada Kunikou

210
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
alerts

211
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Matsumura Kunihiro

212
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Matsumura 뭐야

213
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Matsumura Kuniho! Everyone out!

214
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Yamada Kuniko-san is in 3rd place.

215
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Wait a minute!

216
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
You're pretty close to the finish line.

217
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Now, finally, the last question!

218
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
The last question is this!

219
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Omae OO!

220
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
What?

221
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I'm going to die if you don't answer!

222
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
You better be prepared!

223
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Long time no see!

224
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
It's been a while since we stood here and talked.

225
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
We stood on the New York stage though.

226
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,000
There were a lot of Japanese people.

227
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
There was a lot of excitement there.

228
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
The black guy in front of us.

229
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I didn't like it.

230
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
It was really cold just talking about the black guy.

231
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I didn't like it just looking at him.

232
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
He was like this the whole time.

233
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I'm going to die if you don't answer!

234
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I'm going to die if you don't answer!

235
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I'm going to die if you don't answer!

236
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I'm going to die if you don't answer!

237
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I'm going to die if you don't answer!

238
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
It was hard.

239
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
How was New York?

240
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
New York?

241
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
So you're in 2nd place?

242
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
That's right.

243
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Did you have fun?

244
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I was in 4th place.

245
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
It's your first time.

246
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I'm a member of a video company.

247
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
A rental video company?

248
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
In New York?

249
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Yes.

250
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I still have to go back to New York.

251
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
There were a lot of returnees.

252
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Well, well, well.

253
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I'm the face of the company.

254
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
The face of the company?

255
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
What are you talking about?

256
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
That's a weird match.

257
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
How was it going there for the first time?

258
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:05,000
First of all, I can't stand that long airplane.

259
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I've been on it for 14 hours.

260
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I've never sat on the same chair for 14 hours in my life.

261
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I'm the face of the company.

262
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I've never sat on the same chair for 14 hours in my life.

263
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I don't know why.

264
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I'm scared.

265
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Your butt?

266
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Why?

267
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I've been sitting behind you.

268
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
When you sit down and stand up, it's like going to the bathroom.

269
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Can't you move freely?

270
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I know that.

271
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I was given a chance.

272
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Were you scared?

273
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Yes.

274
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
You have to sit down according to the number.

275
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
You're like a village chief.

276
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
That's not true.

277
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I just drank a lot of wine in the chair I was given.

278
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
That's right.

279
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
You shouldn't drink so much.

280
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
You're crazy.

281
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I'm not crazy.

282
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I'm a crazy person.

283
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I expect a lot of things on the plane.

284
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I can say a lot of things other than that.

285
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,000
But I don't know if I'm holding back.

286
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I didn't know that.

287
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
What are you talking about?

288
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I was eating udon.

289
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
JAL is making cup udon.

290
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I wanted to eat udon.

291
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I couldn't eat it.

292
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I was sleeping in front of you.

293
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I looked like I was going to eat udon.

294
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I looked like I didn't have udon.

295
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
But I couldn't say it.

296
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I was sleeping with an eye mask on.

297
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Didn't you know that?

298
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I usually eat food on the plane.

299
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Why did you only order oolong tea?

300
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
You like me, don't you?

301
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Why do you sleep for 14 hours a day?

302
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
There are many mysteries on the plane.

303
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:36,000
When you cross the change line, you can close the window.

304
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Why is that?

305
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Can't you see it?

306
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Is there something?

307
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
There must be something.

308
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
What is it?

309
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000
There is a mammoth walking on the plane.

310
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,000
There are many mysteries on the plane.

311
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I can't see it.

312
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I can't stand 14 hours a day.

313
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,000
That's where we're sitting.

314
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Downtown and Okamoto are the executives.

315
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:21,000
He went to the chair to make fun of the staff.

316
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
What are you eating?

317
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
It's a leaf.

318
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
That's fine.

319
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
It's the staff.

320
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,000
It's the staff, so it's the other general staff.

321
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:40,000
It's different.

322
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:00,000
The bread is in the bag.

323
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I want to put the bread in the basket and bring it to you.

324
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Do you want to eat it?

325
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
It's better not to go there.

326
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I've been there.

327
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:21,000
The sad thing about Japanese people is that they go there and try to speak English.

328
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
That's not cool.

329
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I'm a dignified person.

330
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I was sleeping in that room.

331
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I was sleeping.

332
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
The cleaning lady came to me.

333
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
There was still time until the meeting time.

334
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I opened the door and started singing.

335
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I don't sing anymore.

336
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Wait a minute. I'll be out soon.

337
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
That's clear in Japanese.

338
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
It's clear.

339
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
What about you?

340
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I don't sing anymore.

341
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
You are a dignified person.

342
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
When I go there, I'm more dignified.

343
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Why?

344
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I feel like I can do it alone at night.

345
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Alone?

346
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Alone at night.

347
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
How do you feel?

348
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I was surrounded.

349
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
You were surrounded?

350
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I was surrounded by 30 people.

351
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I was surrounded by 30 people.

352
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
What are you talking about?

353
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Where are you from?

354
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I don't know.

355
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I told you.

356
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
You told me.

357
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I told you.

358
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
He didn't say anything.

359
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Where are you from?

360
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Why did you tell me?

361
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I didn't say anything.

362
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Where are you from?

363
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I'll go there again.

364
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I'll go there again.

365
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
No, no, no.

366
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
It's heavy.

367
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Let's shake hands and break up.

368
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Why?

369
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I'll still send you a letter.

370
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:12,000
How did the cockroach in the middle of the nostalgic cockroach Hoi Hoi go inside?

371
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
That has a female elephant.

372
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
What is a female elephant?

373
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
A cockroach goes like this.

374
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
It's a cockroach Hoi Hoi.

375
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Okay.

376
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
There is food in the middle of the cockroach Hoi Hoi.

377
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
There is food.

378
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
So, if I shout,

379
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
it's going to be powerful.

380
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Why?

381
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
It's already sticky from the first step.

382
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I don't have anything to eat, so I'm desperate.

383
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I want to get there first.

384
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I shout.

385
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
When I get there, it's like this.

386
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
You notice it for the first time.

387
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
It's like this.

388
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:59,000
For example, the first stupid cockroach goes like this.

389
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I can't do it anymore.

390
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I can't give up.

391
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
It's too fast.

392
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:11,000
On top of that, the cockroach, cockroach, cockroach.

393
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,000
If you open it, there is a cockroach in the middle.

394
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
There are times when there is a cockroach.

395
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
My friend is sleeping.

396
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
There is a cockroach on top of it.

397
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Really?

398
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
What are you doing?

399
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
You have to see it first.

400
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
You have to see it first.

401
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I can't do it anymore.

402
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,000
What are you doing?

403
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
What are you doing?

404
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
It's sticky.

405
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
What?

406
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
It's sticky.

407
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Are you okay?

408
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Did I do it?

409
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
You should stop.

410
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Shut up.

411
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Are you okay?

412
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Try it.

413
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,000
What are you doing next?

414
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I can't do it anymore.

415
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,000
That was funny.

416
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Do you know this?

417
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
What is it?

418
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Where do the shoes of worn shoes go?

419
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I don't know.

420
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,000
There are a lot of people walking.

421
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:31,000
If it's accumulated from top to bottom, it should be like this.

422
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Where do those shoes go?

423
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
That's right.

424
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Everyone is gathering at night.

425
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
The shoes are gathering.

426
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Young people.

427
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Young people are gathering.

428
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
You can be a leader there.

429
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Gather.

430
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Gather.

431
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
And?

432
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:57,000
What about the long boots?

433
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
You can talk about various things.

434
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
When did you come?

435
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
When did you come?

436
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Where were you born?

437
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:09,000
I'm a slipper.

438
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Are you serious?

439
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
There are people walking in slippers.

440
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I don't treat slippers well.

441
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
You don't treat them well?

442
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
I don't treat them well.

443
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Do they disappear somewhere?

444
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:26,000
They gather at night.

445
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:36,000
They gather and become Hamamura Jun's shoes.

446
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Thank you for your hard work.

447
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Thank you.

448
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,000
What are you going to do?

449
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I'm going home.

450
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
I haven't decided anything yet.

451
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
I see.

452
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Don't watch TV.

453
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I was really working hard.

454
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Everyone is working hard.

455
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Thank you for your hard work.

456
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Thank you.
