00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
This program is brought to you by the following sponsors.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Mak-chan is so cute. Mak-chan is so cute. Why is Mak-chan so cute?

3
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Thank you very much.

4
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Hello.

5
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Today is the first day of the festival.

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Is that so?

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Thank you very much.

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Thank you very much.

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Thank you very much.

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
This is the first time this year, right?

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Yes.

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
If the first time doesn't go well, it's going to be a bad year.

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
That's right.

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Can I entrust it to today's guest?

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
You don't have to entrust it to me.

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I'm doing it on my own.

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
That's right.

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
When I came in today, there were a lot of these people.

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
What kind of reaction is that?

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
The stars are passing by a little more.

21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I wonder if I can meet them.

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I don't care if you don't meet them.

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I'm going to treat them badly.

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I'm sorry.

25
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm going to treat them badly.

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I'm going to treat them badly.

27
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Really.

28
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Why are you ignoring me?

29
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I don't know how to treat them.

30
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Don't hit me too much. My skin will fly off.

31
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
It's burnt.

32
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
It's burnt.

33
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
In the end, we didn't meet in Guam at all.

34
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
That's right.

35
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
That's right.

36
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
It seems that there was a mistake once.

37
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
There was a mistake.

38
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I avoided it.

39
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I avoided it with a full hand.

40
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Why do you avoid it?

41
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
What is it?

42
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Why are you doing that?

43
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
You said you were going to the pool.

44
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I didn't go to the pool.

45
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I went to Kmart.

46
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I don't know that.

47
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
We were going.

48
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I was waiting for the car outside.

49
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I saw it.

50
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I saw it.

51
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I was going to the front.

52
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I saw it.

53
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I saw it.

54
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I was going to go to the front.

55
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I saw it.

56
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I was going to go to the front.

57
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I saw it.

58
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I saw it.

59
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
There was a taxi that stopped and came down.

60
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I was going.

61
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I drove the car.

62
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I said, I'm here.

63
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I was waiting for the taxi.

64
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I don't think I was in a taxi.

65
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
You don't know the taxi or the car.

66
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I don't know.

67
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I've been to Japan Mart a couple of times.

68
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Why have you been there three times?

69
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I've been there once.

70
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
How many times?

71
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
You should have been there once.

72
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I've been there, I've been there.

73
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I've been to many places.

74
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
You've been to many places.

75
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Oh, really?

76
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I was wondering what I should do tomorrow.

77
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I was thinking of going to the pool.

78
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I heard that Hamada-san's family was making a reservation.

79
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I thought I should go the day after tomorrow.

80
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I knew it.

81
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I didn't have to go there.

82
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
If I go with you, I'll be blamed for this.

83
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
You can see it, right?

84
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
That's right.

85
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I've given up.

86
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Is that so?

87
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
But...

88
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
What is it?

89
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
It's my first time.

90
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I've been to many places during the New Year.

91
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
It's a bit annoying.

92
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I heard that you were very rude.

93
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
What?

94
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
You've been to many places.

95
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
What?

96
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Everyone knows that.

97
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,000
If you say that, I'll tell everyone that you've been to many places.

98
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
One of your family members took a picture of you on a plane.

99
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
It was right after you arrived, right?

100
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
One of your family members took a picture of you on a plane.

101
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
What did you take a picture of?

102
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
You shouldn't get so angry.

103
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
You hit Hamada's shoulder and looked back.

104
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I heard that it was Tashiro-san.

105
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
That's correct.

106
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I heard that.

107
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
What did you take a picture of?

108
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Don't get angry.

109
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
He took me out.

110
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
What is it?

111
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I took a picture of Tashiro-san.

112
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I took a picture of you.

113
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Tashiro-san said,

114
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Did you take a picture of me?

115
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
That's right.

116
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Why is the family in Osaka so bad?

117
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I said that last year.

118
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
That's terrible.

119
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
What did you do?

120
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
What should I say?

121
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
What did you do?

122
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,000
The people in Tokyo came to me with a tone-deaf face.

123
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
They said,

124
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Can I take a picture of you?

125
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I said,

126
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I'm sorry.

127
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
They said,

128
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I'm sorry.

129
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I said,

130
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I'm sorry.

131
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I said,

132
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I'm sorry.

133
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I said,

134
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I'm sorry.

135
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I said,

136
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I'm sorry.

137
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I said,

138
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I'm sorry.

139
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I said,

140
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,000
That family in Osaka is really bad.

141
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
They said,

142
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I'm sorry.

143
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I said,

144
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I'm sorry.

145
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
What did they say?

146
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
They tried to teach me.

147
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
With a loud voice.

148
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
They treated me as a guest.

149
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
They said,

150
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Come on, let's run away.

151
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
They said,

152
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Come on, let's run away.

153
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
At that time,

154
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
They said,

155
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I'm sorry, I can't do this anymore.

156
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
They said,

157
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I'm not so good.

158
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
They said,

159
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I'm not so good.

160
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
One old lady said,

161
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Seriously.

162
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
You understand, don't you?

163
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Young people are really bad.

164
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
No, no.

165
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
They said two things.

166
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Seriously.

167
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
They said,

168
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
What are you doing?

169
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
You'll get hurt.

170
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I said,

171
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
What are you doing?

172
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
They said,

173
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
What are you doing?

174
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
They said,

175
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
You'll get hurt.

176
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I said,

177
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
We're not together today.

178
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
They said,

179
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
What?

180
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
They laughed with their mouths open.

181
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
You understand, don't you?

182
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
They laughed with their mouths open.

183
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
What?

184
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Why is that funny?

185
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
What's funny?

186
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
They laughed.

187
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
They laughed with their mouths open.

188
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
They were really angry.

189
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
They were in the pool.

190
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
They were swimming in the pool.

191
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I thought,

192
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
That's easy.

193
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
There was a child inside.

194
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
He said,

195
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
That's from Tokyo.

196
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
It's true.

197
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
It's a bald man.

198
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
It's a bald man.

199
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
It's the same kind of thing.

200
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
It's okay to be bald.

201
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
It's okay to be bald.

202
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
It's a bald man.

203
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
It's like rice balls and rice.

204
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
It's okay to be bald.

205
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
It's a bald man.

206
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Can you move your body for an hour?

207
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
For about 50,000 yen.

208
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I want to go to the stairs of Duty Free.

209
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I want to go to the stairs of Duty Free.

210
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I want to go to the second floor.

211
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
It's okay to be bald.

212
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I want to go to the second floor.

213
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I want to go to the third floor.

214
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I want to go to the seventh floor.

215
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I really want to do it.

216
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
This is a real film.

217
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Pretend to be catching his child.

218
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
He will catch it.

219
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Obviously, you don't understand.

220
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:08,500
I don't know.

221
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,000
But if you go to the doctor, you'll know what kind of answer he'll give you, right?

222
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
No, I didn't take it.

223
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,500
You didn't?

224
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:17,000
I know that I took it myself, so I can't say it.

225
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
But he completely focused on me.

226
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
And when I opened my eyes, he was like...

227
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I can't see! He was running so fast!

228
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I want to do it.

229
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I can't do it!

230
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I can't do it!

231
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I can't do it!

232
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I can't do it!

233
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Shut up!

234
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I'm so angry!

235
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I know, right?

236
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
When we went to the doctor, he said a lot of things, right?

237
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
You'll know when you go to the doctor, right?

238
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I know.

239
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
When we went to the doctor, he was obviously filming from here.

240
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
The camera!

241
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
He was like...

242
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
And when I noticed...

243
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I was like, excuse me.

244
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Can I talk to you?

245
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I didn't take it!

246
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
What are you talking about?

247
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Okay, go away!

248
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Go away!

249
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Your words are amazing too!

250
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I didn't take it, so go away!

251
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
So you told him to go away?

252
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Yeah.

253
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I told him to go away, and after about 3 minutes, he got angry again.

254
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
He was angry, right?

255
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Yeah.

256
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
He was like, I didn't take it!

257
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I'm so angry!

258
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I told him to go away, but he didn't want to show it.

259
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I'm so angry!

260
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
He was really angry, so he was like this.

261
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
There was a table, so I couldn't give it to him.

262
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
But he was so angry!

263
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
And he was like this.

264
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I was like...

265
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I told him to go away!

266
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
He was like this, and then he came to the counter, and I was like this.

267
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
He was trying to stop me.

268
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
What are you talking about?

269
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
He was really angry.

270
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
He was really angry.

271
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
He came in a polite way.

272
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
He didn't want people to notice.

273
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
He didn't want to take pictures, but he wanted to shake hands.

274
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
He didn't want people to take pictures, but he wanted to shake hands.

275
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
He didn't want people to notice.

276
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Right?

277
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I was really angry.

278
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I was really angry.

279
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
The kid was like...

280
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
What was that?

281
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
What?

282
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
He was just flying.

283
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Why did he suddenly...

284
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
He was like this.

285
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
What has changed since then?

286
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
It's funny.

287
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
What's different now than a minute ago?

288
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Suddenly, he was like this.

289
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I was like this and that, and suddenly he was happy.

290
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
He was like this.

291
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
He was like this.

292
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
He was like this.

293
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Why?

294
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
When he arrives, he jumps.

295
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Then he jumps.

296
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
He puts it in his hands.

297
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Why is that?

298
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I can't help but laugh.

299
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
The plane was precious.

300
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
That plane was precious.

301
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I quite like him.

302
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Did he appeared on the shown TV show?

303
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
No, I didn't watch it.

304
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Are you telling me you didn't do it?

305
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
What do you mean you didn't do it?

306
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I did it when I arrived, but I think it was a mistake.

307
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I think my parents didn't do it.

308
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Oh, really?

309
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
My lower jaw was in bad shape, so I had to hold it all the time.

310
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Oh, your chin?

311
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
My chin?

312
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Something came off.

313
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
My jaw was in bad shape?

314
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
What do you mean?

315
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
No, no, no.

316
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
It's not like that.

317
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
It's not like that.

318
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
It's not like that.

319
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:28,000
When I came out of the plane, someone came and told me to talk to you.

320
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
My jaw was in bad shape, so I had to hold it.

321
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Your jaw?

322
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
No, I don't want to talk about my jaw.

323
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,000
My jaw was in bad shape, and I tried to bite the back of the person in front of the plane.

324
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I thought you didn't like it.

325
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
My jaw was in bad shape, so I said, I'm sorry.

326
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I said, I'm sorry, but I didn't do it on purpose.

327
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
You said, wait.

328
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I said, I'm sorry, but I didn't do it on purpose.

329
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I was told, I'll talk to you when I get there.

330
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I said, it's okay. I didn't do anything wrong.

331
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I walked a little, and there was a bus stop, so I thought it would be faster to take this.

332
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I got on the bus, and I got to the exit.

333
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I saw the back of the bus, and I was waiting for me there.

334
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
It's weird to go back.

335
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I'm sorry.

336
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I said, no, no.

337
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
What's wrong with you?

338
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I'm a show-off comedian.

339
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I'm a show-off comedian.

340
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I don't know.

341
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I'm a show-off comedian.

342
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I'm a show-off comedian.

343
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
What are you talking about?

344
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I'm going to kill you.

345
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Mr. Matsumoto, who is a stylist for Sachiko Kobayashi.

346
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Yes.

347
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Please tell us about this year's Kouhaku's costume.

348
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
It's a long story.

349
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Well, that's right.

350
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
It's already decided?

351
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
It's already decided.

352
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
It's already decided.

353
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
What was the Kouhaku last year?

354
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
What was the Kouhaku last year?

355
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
You're the Kouhaku.

356
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
What I'm saying is wrong, and what the stylist is saying is weird.

357
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
How was it, everyone?

358
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
How was it?

359
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
What was the Kouhaku last year?

360
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Has anyone seen it?

361
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Huh?

362
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
It's Princess Kaguya.

363
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Princess Kaguya.

364
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Princess Kaguya.

365
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
It's Princess Kaguya.

366
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Well, if I say this, you might say, don't say it.

367
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Maybe I'll cut it.

368
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
What?

369
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Maybe I'll cut it.

370
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Last year's costume is red this year.

371
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
What do you mean?

372
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Huh?

373
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Last year's costume?

374
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Last year's costume is red this year.

375
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
You mean the color is different?

376
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
But this time it's L.

377
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
The size is different.

378
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
The size is different, but the color is different.

379
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
If the size is different and the color is different, it's completely different.

380
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
That's not true.

381
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I'm looking at it.

382
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
It's Princess Kaguya.

383
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
No, no, no.

384
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Last year's costume was like this.

385
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
It's a little rough.

386
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Hey, have fun.

387
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Last year's costume was like this.

388
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I can't tell the difference.

389
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Oh, is that so?

390
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
It's strange.

391
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
If I say this year's costume is like this, you might say,

392
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Ah...

393
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Skeleton.

394
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Skeleton.

395
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
What's skeleton?

396
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I wear a skeleton.

397
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
You wear a skeleton?

398
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
You wear a skeleton?

399
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
It's all transparent.

400
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
It's all transparent.

401
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Finally.

402
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I wonder if NHK will forgive me.

403
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
There's no way they'll forgive you.

404
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Why?

405
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Because they'll take off your veil.

406
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
You're wrong.

407
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
They'll take off your veil.

408
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Is that so?

409
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Yes.

410
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Matsumoto-san also experienced it.

411
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
The children in Hamada-san's house do it in a very unpleasant way.

412
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
They ask the people around them to do it.

413
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
What kind of way is it?

414
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
This is really unpleasant.

415
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
What is it?

416
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
How is your education?

417
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,000
After all, it's money.

418
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
What are you talking about?

419
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Be the demon of money.

420
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
What is that?

421
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
That's unpleasant.

422
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
What's unpleasant?

423
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
What kind of way is it?

424
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:28,000
They'll jump out of the car.

425
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
It's a hit.

426
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
It's not a joke.

427
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
If I say, are you okay?

428
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:43,000
They'll say, good morning.

429
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:48,000
They'll say, good morning.

430
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
They'll say, good morning.

431
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
It's funny.

432
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
If you don't do it, it can't be helped.

433
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
That's right.

434
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
If you don't do it, it can't be helped.

435
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
If you don't do it, it can't be helped.

436
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
If you say, good morning,

437
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:10,000
they'll take off your veil in front of the car.

438
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Do you really have to say that?

439
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
They'll take off your veil in front of the car.

440
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Mr. Matsumoto, you've made a lot of talk shows.

441
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I've noticed that all your shows are fake.

442
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Fake?

443
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Fake?

444
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
If it's fake this year,

445
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Morning Musume's Love Machine

446
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,000
or Hiromi's Goldfinger...

447
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I don't know.

448
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I don't know.

449
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Isn't it a hit?

450
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
It's a hit.

451
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
For now, Mr. Matsumoto,

452
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
please make new shows.

453
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,000
There's a song called Pakurireki by Mr. Matsumoto.

454
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Ian Bakan is playing the role of Mr. Haisai.

455
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:00,000
It's Bartle.

456
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I've prepared a song for you.

457
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Ian Bakan, that's no good.

458
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Next, Taxi Driver.

459
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
This is totally original.

460
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
This is Tokyo Bus Girl.

461
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Inaho ga Yureru

462
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
The inaho is swaying.

463
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
He is a taxi driver.

464
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Pasta.

465
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Alright.

466
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Baku.

467
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Alright.

468
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I'm the bus of the bus.

469
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
You can't say, ''Let's go!''

470
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Buses usually say, ''Let's go!''

471
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
It's strange to say, ''Let's go!'' and then say, ''Let's go!''

472
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
There's no such thing. They're all the same.

473
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
What is it?

474
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Machan baby.

475
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
This is completely original.

476
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Kawaii baby.

477
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Machan baby.

478
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Hi, hi.

479
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Machan is really cute.

480
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Machan is cute.

481
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Why?

482
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Kawaii baby.

483
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Hi, hi.

484
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Kawaii baby.

485
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Hi, hi.

486
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
There's a slight difference.

487
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
What?

488
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
''Pakuri'' is a bit different.

489
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
If you fight in court, you'll definitely win.

490
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
No way.

491
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I don't think you can win.

492
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I think you'll win.

493
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Either way, make a device this year.

494
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
I will.

495
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
So there's no Machan baby.

496
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Why not?

497
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
I can't come up with anything.

498
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
If the reason is that clear...

499
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
I got it.

500
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
That's the most important part.

501
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
That's right.

502
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
That's right.

503
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
So today, just give us a hint.

504
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
What kind of hint?

505
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Before, when we did the Sharankyu, you made the foundation.

506
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
I made it.

507
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
If you do that...

508
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
If you do that...

509
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
If there's a musician watching on TV...

510
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
If that's the case, we'll do it.

511
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Just give us a hint.

512
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Really?

513
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
What would be good?

514
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
I want to start with WOW!

515
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Wait a minute.

516
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
I want to start with WOW!

517
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I want to start with WOW!

518
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Maachan, Hayama-chan, this is fun!

519
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Wait a minute.

520
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I haven't said anything yet.

521
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
I haven't said anything yet.

522
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
It's okay.

523
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Maachan, Hayama-chan, Maachan...

524
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Maachan, Maachan, this is fun!

525
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Hama-chan, that's enough.

526
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Why?

527
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Put it in.

528
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Ballad.

529
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Ballad?

530
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Ballad.

531
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Let's start with ballad.

532
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Wait a minute.

533
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Let's start with ballad.

534
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
What do you mean?

535
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Let's change it somewhere.

536
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Let's do it like that.

537
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Let's change it from ballad.

538
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Is that okay?

539
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
It's okay.

540
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
It's okay to say that.

541
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Should we do a counting song?

542
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
It'll be like this.

543
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
But isn't counting good?

544
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
One...

545
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
One...

546
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
One...

547
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
One...

548
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
One...

549
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
One...

550
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Two...

551
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
One...

552
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Two...

553
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
What are you saying?

554
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
That's not good.

555
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
If you do all the songs...

556
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
I will do them.

557
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
I will do them.

558
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
I will do them.

559
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
I wonder if I can do them.

560
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
What are you talking about at the start of the year?

561
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
I want you to decide on a title.

562
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
What is that?

563
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Mamma Mia.

564
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Mamma Mia?

565
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Yeah.

566
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Mamma Mia?

567
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
I got it.

568
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Mamma Mia.

569
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
The title is Mamma Mia.

570
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Wait! Give me some time to think!

571
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
I'm from Osaka!

572
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
It's fine, but...

573
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
You just said the title.

574
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
The title?

575
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Then I'll go with Mamma Mia.

576
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Mamma Mia of tears.

577
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Don't make me laugh!

578
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Tears?

579
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Then...

580
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Osu!

581
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Osu! Mamma Mia!

582
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Really?

583
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
I don't know.

584
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I got it.

585
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Osu! Mamma Mia!

586
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
I'll release it soon.

587
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Really?

588
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,000
If there's a musician watching this,

589
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
I'll ask them to make it.

590
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Osu! Mamma Mia!

591
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,000
The title of the song is Osikko de manhenne.

592
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
No!

593
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
No!

594
00:23:52,000 --> 00:24:05,000
De manhenne is no good!
