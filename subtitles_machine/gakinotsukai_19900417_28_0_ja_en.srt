Good evening everyone!

00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Are you ready? There are 6 boxes in the back.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Why are you looking at me?

00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
There are 6 boxes in the back.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
This is the big Tsunahiki competition.

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
There are 3 more skaters in the boxes including us.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I see.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
We did it together, so I'll do my best.

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
We will choose 3 more skaters.

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Each of us will score 3 points.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000

00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Where are the rest?

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
What are you doing?

23
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Hey!

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I don't like it.

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I'll do it like this.

26
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'm the only skater.

27
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm the skater.

28
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
You look strong.

Are you a skater?

58
00:02:41,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Don't reply like that.

59
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
That's all.

60
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Let's do it.

61
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
This is a female skater.

62
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Everyone except me is a female skater.

00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Captain Taika.

64
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Only this part.

This is strange.

I knew it.

87
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000

What are you doing?

93
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
It hurts.

94
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000

It's beautiful.

107
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
It looks like it's just been made.

108
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
It's just been made.

109
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
The audience looks beautiful too.

110
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
With this beautiful chair.

111
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
It's not a big deal.

112
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I found something amazing today.

113
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Something amazing?

114
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I'm amazing.

115
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
What is it?

116
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I've been doing a lot of research.

117
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
When?

118
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I've been doing it all this time.

119
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I realized something.

120
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
What?

121
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
No matter what you say, I can do it with my bare hands.

122
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
This is amazing.

123
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I can do it normally.

124
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
You can do it normally.

125
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I can do everything with my bare hands.

126
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I don't know if this is amazing.

127
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Why bare hands?

128
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I've been thinking about it a lot.

129
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
This is the best.

130
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
There are a lot of things.

131
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
This is the best.

132
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I found out that I can do it 100%.

133
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
That's great.

134
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Shall we try it?

135
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Sure.

136
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
What should we start with?

00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
That's fast.

143
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I can't think of anything.

144
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000

You don't have to say it.

Everyone knows what it is.

155
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000

197
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Slipper.

198
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
You can't say it.

199
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
You can't say it.

200
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
You can't say it.

201
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Say it.

202
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
It's a sparrow.

203
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
A sparrow.

204
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
A sparrow.

205
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
A sparrow.

206
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
A sparrow.

207
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
It's a sparrow.

208
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Sushi.

209
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Sushi.

210
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Sushi.

211
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
It's fast.

212
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Cinderella Express.

213
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
It's amazing.

214
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Sudachi.

215
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Sudachi.

216
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Chikan.

217
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Chiran.

218
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
What?

219
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Chiran.

220
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Tyrannosaurus?

221
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
What is that?

222
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
That's great.

223
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Is there such thing as Tyrannosaurus?

224
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Yes, there is.

225
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
There isn't.

226
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:54,000
As a result of my research, there is no doubt that it can be returned.

227
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I don't know if there is no doubt.

228
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Please try it.

229
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
More and more.

230
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
With bare hands?

231
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Yes.

232
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
It will definitely be okay.

233
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Really?

234
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
100%.

235
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
You can return it with bare hands?

236
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I've been writing it on the Shinkansen for a long time.

237
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
What is that?

238
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
What is that?

239
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
There is no other way.

240
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
It's normal.

241
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Really?

242
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
There is nothing that starts with Tsu and ends with Tsu.

243
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Tsu is the head.

244
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Yes.

245
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
The butt is Tsu.

246
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Everyone thinks about it.

247
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
There is only one.

248
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Yes.

249
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Tsu of Tsubame.

250
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
This is the only way.

251
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Really?

252
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
There is absolutely no other way.

253
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
You are like a machine.

254
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
You are like a machine.

255
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Really?

256
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Yes.

257
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
You are right.

258
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
If Kina came, I would be very happy.

259
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Why?

260
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Kinran-donsu.

261
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I wanted to say that.

262
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Yes.

263
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
It's a good word.

264
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Yes.

265
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
If it is D, it's a good word.

266
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Rhythm and Blues.

267
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
It's a good word when you say it.

268
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
It's a bit late, but it's fun to talk with people.

269
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
How many times did you write it?

270
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
There are many.

271
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
There are about 1000 times.

272
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
There were many times when I wrote it in the Shinkansen.

273
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
There were about 200 or 300 times when you wrote it in the Shinkansen.

274
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Why didn't you write it immediately?

275
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I think it was a good idea to follow the memory.

276
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
It doesn't matter.

277
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I've been following it for a long time.

278
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
It doesn't matter.

279
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I don't know how to finish it normally.

280
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
But it's fun now, isn't it?

281
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Yes.

282
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
There was a game where you had to say something irrelevant.

283
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
There was a game where you had to say something irrelevant.

284
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I'm good at that.

285
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I'm good at that.

286
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Really?

287
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Yes.

288
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
It's hot.

289
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
What time is it now?

290
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
It's getting really hot these days.

291
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Your face is getting red.

292
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
What time did you wake up today?

293
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
What?

294
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
What time did you wake up today?

295
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
What?

296
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
What time did you wake up today?

297
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
What?

298
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
What did you eat for breakfast today?

299
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
What?

300
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I'm hungry.

301
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I have to eat something in the morning.

302
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
My eyebrows are like this.

303
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
What?

304
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Wait a minute.

305
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
If you just focus on one thing, you can do anything.

306
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
What do you mean?

307
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
You have to say different things one by one.

308
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
If you just focus on one thing...

309
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
This button is big.

310
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
But seriously, what did you sleep last night?

311
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I'm tired.

312
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
That's dirty.

313
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
You didn't sleep at all?

314
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Not at all.

315
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I can't do this.

316
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I can't do this.

317
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
It's quite fun, isn't it?

318
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
It's nostalgic.

319
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
What kind of game did you play?

320
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
That's...

321
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
You make it square, and then you split it in the middle.

322
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
1, 2, 3, 4, then you shoot a number.

323
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
You do this with a dodgeball.

324
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Like this.

325
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Yes, yes.

326
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I've been thinking about that.

327
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I'm a very honest person.

328
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I don't die like this.

329
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Right?

330
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Yes, yes.

331
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Did you have that?

332
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
What?

333
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
It's called Dossun, right?

334
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Yes, it's called Dossun.

335
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Yes.

336
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Also, there was that.

337
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
A mirror game.

338
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
A mirror game?

339
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
You don't know?

340
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
It starts with a mini-comic.

341
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Yes, yes, yes.

342
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
You didn't play that?

343
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
You don't play rock-paper-scissors.

344
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
The loser does this.

345
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Stop it! Stop it!

346
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I'm going to kill you!

347
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I'm going to lock you in here.

348
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
3 years later!

349
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Hoi!

350
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
You didn't do that?

351
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
It's definitely 3 years later.

352
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
After I kill you...

353
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
3 years later!

354
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Hoi!

355
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Hoi!

356
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Hoi!

357
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
If it was 3 years later, you wouldn't be here.

358
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Now, let's introduce the postcards.

359
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Okay.

360
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
So, today...

361
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Where's Nitta?

362
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
What?

363
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Where's Nitta?

364
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Nitta?

365
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I wanted to see Nitta.

366
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Where are you going?

367
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
What are you doing here?

368
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I don't know if this is being edited or not.

369
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
But I wanted to hear your story.

370
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Which one is she?

371
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Which one should I take?

372
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
You like her that much?

373
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
We're both drowning.

374
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
We're so far apart.

375
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
There's only one float.

376
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
There's only one float.

377
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Which one?

378
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Which one?

379
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Which one?

380
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I can't take it anymore.

381
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I can't take it anymore.

382
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
You're the float.

383
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Which one?

384
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Which one?

385
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Which one should I throw?

386
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Throw it and I'll take it.

387
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I don't like this woman.

388
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I'll help you with the opening today.

389
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Thank you very much.

390
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I'll read this one.

391
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Tokyo and Arakawa are 16 year old Miwa-chan.

392
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I want you to tell us about the time difference game you played when you were a student.

393
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
And if you have any tips on how to succeed.

394
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
This was quite interesting.

395
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
The time difference game.

396
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I'm sure some of you have played it before.

397
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
It was good when you were going to school.

398
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:31,000
When you go to school, there's always an emergency meeting.

399
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,000
You have to stand on the first floor of the school building.

400
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
When your friends come, you say,

401
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Hey, it's been a while. What class is next?

402
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:45,000
You talk to them and tell them that you're on the first floor.

403
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:50,000
When you go up the stairs, you run down the emergency stairs.

404
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
You have to wait 4 or 5 times.

405
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
When you say, Oh!

406
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
This is the time difference game.

407
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Just like that?

408
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
That's all for today.

409
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
There's still some time left.

410
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
There's still some time left.

411
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Okay, I got it.

412
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Let's start the game.

413
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I'll decide the winning and losing.

414
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
What are you going to do?

415
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I'll decide the winning and losing.

416
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
What am I supposed to say?

417
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I always win and lose.

418
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Okay?

419
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
If I lose,

420
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I'll say,

421
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Good morning, it's Asahi.

422
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
What the hell?

423
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
You only say Osaka.

424
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
What do you mean, Good morning, it's Asahi?

425
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Where are you coming from?

426
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Zoom in, it's Asahi.

427
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
What the hell?

428
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I'll ask you to do something instead of that.

429
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Wait, wait, wait.

430
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,000
At that time, it was decided that Zoom in, it's Asahi if I lose.

431
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
But now, there's nothing.

432
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
What if I lose?

433
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I can't do anything without that.

434
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
No.

435
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I'll think about it now.

436
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Now?

437
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
It's a TV show.

438
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
You should have told me earlier.

439
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I can't understand.

440
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I see.

441
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Before this show,

442
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I started it.

443
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
That's right.

444
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
But I can't do it.

445
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I can't do anything without it.

446
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Why?

447
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I just know it.

448
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I have to do something more funny.

449
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
What?

450
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I can't do it.

451
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I'm telling you, I have a dream diary.

452
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Dream diary?

453
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I can't do that.

454
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
How can I do that?

455
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I have to go to Kyoto.

456
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
What the hell?

457
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
What the hell?

458
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I have to go to Kyoto.

459
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Dream diary?

460
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
What kind of dream diary?

461
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I'll eat you.

462
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I'll eat your dream.

463
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Only dream?

464
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Yes.

465
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
What the hell?

466
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I'll eat your dream.

467
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I'm scared.

468
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
There is a person over there.

469
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Who?

470
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
That person.

471
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Morio Kazama.

472
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Yes.

473
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Turn the microphone to him.

474
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Ask him the reason of the Super Cup.

475
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,000
He seems to have a reason.

476
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Ask him the reason of the Super Cup.

477
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I can't do that.

478
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I can do it from here.

479
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
After a few months,

480
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
if you don't do something new,

481
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I can't do it, either.

482
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
If you don't do it,

483
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
it's better to lose the game.

484
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
You can't do it again.

485
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
OK.

486
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I'll do this.

487
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
If I lose this year,

488
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I'll be here.

489
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
That's the problem.

490
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I can hear you.

491
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
If I lose this year,

492
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I'll be a kid.

493
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I'll be a kid's servant.

494
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
It's very sad, but...

495
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I'll take a break once.

496
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
What are you doing?

497
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
No.

498
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
You're stupid.

499
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I don't want to take a break.

500
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
What are you talking about?

501
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
It's very sad, but...

502
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Are you a kid?

503
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
It's very sad, but...

504
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I'll take a break once.

505
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
It's very sad, but...

506
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I'll take your wife.

507
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Are you stupid?

508
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
You two...

509
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
You two can't do this.

510
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Why?

511
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
You lost the game.

512
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
No.

513
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I don't want to take a break.

514
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
You're dirty.

515
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I don't care if you say I'm dirty.

516
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
I don't care.

517
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I don't care.

518
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I want to take a break, too.

519
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I want to take a break, too.

520
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
If you lose this year,

521
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I'll stab you with a scissor.

522
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Wait.

523
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I'll put up with the pain,

524
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:18,000
but I don't want to repair it.

525
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I don't want to.

526
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,000
No.

527
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
I don't want to get hurt.

528
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Don't.

529
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
I don't want to.

530
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I don't want to get hurt.

531
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:39,000
I just thought about it.

532
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
What kind of a kid are you?

533
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
You said that when you thought of it.

534
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
It can't be helped.

535
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
That's...

536
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Let's play a game next week.

537
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Sure.

538
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
I'll play a game in the corner of the post box.

539
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
I'll return all the cards.

540
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
You return the cards one by one.

541
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
And the loser...

542
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Let's decide that.

543
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,000
The genius will be like the police officer.

544
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I don't like that.

545
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,000
I'll make sure that you're the master.

546
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
I'll give you a needle and a thread.

547
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Why do I have to get a needle and a thread?

548
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Let's think about the punishment.

549
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
I'll think about it too.

550
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Sure.

551
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
It'll be quick.

552
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Let's do it like that.

553
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Let's do it like this from the beginning.

554
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
That's right.

555
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
That's right.

556
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
There's no end to the thread.

557
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
You have to cut here.

558
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
If you cut it, you can't see it.

559
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
You have to remove all of this.

560
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:50,000
It's like a mother crying.

561
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Even if her children are watching,

562
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
they'll think,

563
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I've been working for a year.

564
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Let's do it like that.

565
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Sure.

566
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Next week,

567
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
let's play a normal match.

568
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Sure.

569
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Let's do it.

570
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Sure.

571
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
But,

572
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
can you stop attacking me with a normal move?

573
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
What do you mean?

574
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
You started with a normal move and stopped with a normal move.

575
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
So the end is a normal move.

576
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
It's not a normal move.

577
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
That's right.

578
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
It's a normal move that's heavier than a normal move.

579
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I see.

580
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
You lost.

581
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
You ended with a normal move.

582
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
So the head is a normal move,

583
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
but the butt is not a normal move.

584
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Not a normal move and not a normal move.

585
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
That's right.

586
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
I see.

587
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
What's next?

588
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
There's one more.

589
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
You have to admit the move.

590
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Yes.

591
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
In your case.

592
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Yes.

593
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
For example, if you come in a car,

594
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
I might call you a carpenter.

595
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Don't say that.

596
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
That's a circle.

597
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
A circle?

598
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Yes.

599
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I can't decide.

600
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Don't sleep.

601
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I got it.

602
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Let's do it like that.

603
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Okay?

604
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Okay?

605
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
You lost.

606
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
How about a penalty game?

607
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
What?

608
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
A penalty game.

609
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
A penalty game.

610
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
I'll think about it.

611
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
There's a mayonnaise.

612
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Yes.

613
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Put it in a container.

614
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Yes.

615
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Put it on your butt.

616
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Yes.

617
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
And you have to poop.

618
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
You have to poop like that.

619
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Yes.

620
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
It's fun.

621
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
It's my first time.

622
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Why?

623
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Also,

624
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
in the postcard,

625
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
there's a question.

626
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Please do something like that.

627
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
The answers are all the same.

628
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Please write more in the postcard.

629
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Please write more in the postcard.

630
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Please write more in the postcard.

631
00:23:40,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Goodbye.
