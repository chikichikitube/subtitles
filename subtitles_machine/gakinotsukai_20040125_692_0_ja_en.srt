1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
What is this?

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
This is crazy!

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
What is it?

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Wait a minute!

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Why are you giving me a license?

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
What do you want?

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Did you get a license?

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Yes, I did.

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Really?

10
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Yes, I did.

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Really?

12
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
License is a small amount, right?

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
No!

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Then why are you giving me a license here?

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
There are many reasons.

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Give it to me!

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Why are you suddenly talking about money?

18
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Give it to me!

19
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I will give it to you!

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
The timing is still the same!

21
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
There was a lot of money before the show started.

22
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Really?

23
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
If I give it to you,

24
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
How many will you give me?

25
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I won't give it to you with one hand.

26
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Really?

27
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Did you hear that?

28
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm looking forward to it.

29
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
This is the first episode this year.

30
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
That's right.

31
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
This program is sponsored by the following sponsors.

32
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
To be honest,

33
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I don't like the first episode of the show.

34
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Really?

35
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm still not excited.

36
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Really?

37
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm not excited.

38
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
But the audience is excited.

39
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
The audience is excited.

40
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Yes, they are.

41
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
It doesn't matter.

42
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
It depends on the show.

43
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
That's right.

44
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
It depends on the show.

45
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Where have you been?

46
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I've been to Australia.

47
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I've never said a word about that country.

48
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Australia?

49
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
You go to places that are easy to understand every year.

50
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I go to places that are easy to understand.

51
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I've been to Guam this year.

52
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
You are a fool.

53
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Yes, I am.

54
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
You are a fool.

55
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
It doesn't matter.

56
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
It's not over if it's over.

57
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
It's not over if it's over.

58
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I went to the elevator.

59
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
We were in the room for 22 times.

60
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
On the way, the door opened.

61
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
A stupid family came in.

62
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
An old man and an old woman.

63
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
The old woman was about the same age as me.

64
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
She was so ugly.

65
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
She was so ugly.

66
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
That's okay.

67
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Like that other children's.

68
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
That's good.

69
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
You are like, who is this?

70
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
That's good.

71
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
It's okay.

72
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
You embrace like this.

73
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
There was only you in the group we were in.

74
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
And you ask how many times on the skit with this group.

75
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
That'sbeeping.

76
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
It's.

77
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
17 times.

78
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
It's bad.

79
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I thought, I'm missing the words.

80
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Right?

81
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Well, yeah.

82
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
And then, I thought, there must be something when I get off.

83
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
So I opened the door and went in.

84
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
And my grandma said, there's nothing here.

85
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
She was like, I'm not going to say anything.

86
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I'm not going to say anything.

87
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I'm not going to say anything.

88
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I couldn't get out of the house.

89
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I was like, I'm not going to say anything.

90
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
It's just a word.

91
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
That's what I think.

92
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
If you say something like that directly, it might become a fight.

93
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
He's the one at fault, but he doesn't want to fight.

94
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
So at that time, I said, I'm sorry.

95
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I don't have anything to do with him, but isn't it strange to look at him?

96
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
It's probably better to be a third party.

97
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
That's right.

98
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Right?

99
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
If you don't do that, he's really embarrassed.

100
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:45,000
If you ask him what he's doing, he'll say, please don't do it. I'll do it if I have to.

101
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
It's definitely better to do it.

102
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
It's okay, but it's not good.

103
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Well, he's the one at fault.

104
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
That's right.

105
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
It's definitely like that.

106
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
It's better to have a psychological part.

107
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
He's like, shut up.

108
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
He's like a fool.

109
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
He's like, huh?

110
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
He's like a fool.

111
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
He's like a fool.

112
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
He's like a fool.

113
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
He's like a fool.

114
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
He's like a fool.

115
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
He's like a fool.

116
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
He's like a fool.

117
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:13,900
Because he's a fool, he does team-w

118
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,100
He's a fool.

119
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:17,000
Is this guy going to do it?

120
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
It's like I'm not protecting anything.

121
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:26,000
There's no way I can just listen to you.

122
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I'm feeling sort of like I used to live downtown.

123
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Come here.

124
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
It's a subtle hair color.

125
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Pen name number 8, Light-san.

126
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:41,500
Yes.

127
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,500
I have a question for you, the kind-hearted Matsumoto-san.

128
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,000
Ah, sure.

129
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Matsumoto-san, it seems that you were expelled from the high school baseball league because you made a terrible mistake in your high school years.

130
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
What kind of mistake was that?

131
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Well, I made a lot of mistakes.

132
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Please tell me. What kind of mistake?

133
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Eh?

134
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
What kind of mistake did you make?

135
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:13,000
The first time I made a mistake was when I threw the ball like this.

136
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:22,000
The moment I threw the ball and went to catch the ball, the seam of the ball came off.

137
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Why did you do that?

138
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Why did you do that?

139
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Why did you do that?

140
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Because it came off.

141
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
The opponent was like, wow, it came off!

142
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Ah, I see.

143
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
This was very popular.

144
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I don't know if it was popular, but...

145
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Before you threw the ball, you had to pull the thread.

146
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
That's primitive.

147
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
If you just pull the thread, anyone can do it.

148
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
If you just pull the thread, anyone can do it.

149
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Ah, I see.

150
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
But it's a bit like a baseball.

151
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Well, that's not a big deal.

152
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I was just a bit angry.

153
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Ah, you were just a bit angry?

154
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I was just a bit angry.

155
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Like Burning by the string.

156
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
like Burning by the string.

157
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Yeah, I was like Burning by the string.

158
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Any number of Roughly Characters is not enough.

159
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
So he told me, any number of Roughly Characters is not enough!

160
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Well, it's fine.

161
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Obviously you haven't worked on the loose ones.

162
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
How?

163
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
For example, about disappearable woodwork.

164
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,500
Those are only candles in manga magazines.

165
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,000
Yeah, right?

166
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
But they aren't like that.

167
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Isn't it something that can be used realistically?

168
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Could you tell us more about that?

169
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Well, I wanted to remove the woodwork.

170
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,900
Look whoever it's from...

171
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,440
It's...

172
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,860
from the ball's perspective!

173
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:35,740
What was that?

174
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,580
You show it with who's perspective?

175
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:39,580
The ball you wanted to disappear from!

176
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,400
Well, I guess with the ball's...

177
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,400
It's from that perspective right?

178
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,900
Yea, it's a concept...

179
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:46,380
If you're aizione, it's also the ball you wanted to make disappear, right?

180
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:48,380
It's the ball that I wanted to make disappear...

181
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:51,680
The ball I wanted to disappear was also a CSS...

182
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,680
And there will be an end to it all.

183
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,460
That ball I wanted to disappear was broken.

184
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:57,560
What do you mean?

185
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:01,560
The batter is the one who wanted to hit.

186
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:08,560
This one threw the ball that wanted to disappear, but the other one threw the bat that wanted to hit.

187
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,560
And then it got hit.

188
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,560
Well, the batter is the one who wanted to hit.

189
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,560
That time was amazing.

190
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,560
Pen name 90's girl.

191
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:22,560
I have a question for the comedian who sings the lyrics.

192
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,560
Sure.

193
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:27,560
A long time ago, the song called Hair and Y-Shirt and Me was a huge hit.

194
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,560
Yes, yes, yes.

195
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,560
What did you want to say about that song?

196
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:34,560
Well, have you heard it before?

197
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,560
Well, yes, but I don't remember it clearly.

198
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,560
Ah, that's right.

199
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,560
Well, that's right.

200
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,560
But it was a huge hit.

201
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,560
Well, yes.

202
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,560
What did you want to say?

203
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,560
Well, that...

204
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,560
Hair and Y-Shirt and Me.

205
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,560
Hair and Y-Shirt and Me.

206
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:53,560
Well, to put it simply...

207
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:56,560
Hair and Y-Shirt and Me.

208
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,560
That heart is me.

209
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,560
To put it simply...

210
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,560
I said it really simply.

211
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,560
I'm sorry.

212
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:10,560
Mr. Matsumoto said that you went to your son's class.

213
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,560
Is that true?

214
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,560
I did.

215
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,560
You didn't!

216
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,560
You didn't go!

217
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,560
I did.

218
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,560
I think it was when I was in 4th grade.

219
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,560
That's a long time ago.

220
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,560
Yes, I did.

221
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,560
Oh, really?

222
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,560
Yes.

223
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,560
I don't know if I should say this on TV or not.

224
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,560
Why?

225
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,560
I was surprised.

226
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,560
What do you mean?

227
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:34,560
I watched it from the first hour to the fourth hour.

228
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,560
That's a long time ago!

229
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:40,560
Normally, there are at least two of them.

230
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:43,560
When I was about to go home, the other students wouldn't let go of my hand.

231
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:44,560
Ah, I see.

232
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,560
Because you came.

233
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,560
Yes, because I came.

234
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,560
Originally, there was a place for children.

235
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:52,560
I wonder how many times I patted my head.

236
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,560
I patted my head about 2,000 times.

237
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,560
Why?

238
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,560
I was surprised.

239
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,560
Yes.

240
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:04,560
Other than the third hour, my nose kept drooping.

241
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,560
A 4th grader's nose won't droop.

242
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:12,560
That was a huge amount.

243
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,560
There was a groove around here.

244
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,560
It was like a habit.

245
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:20,560
It was drooping so many times.

246
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,560
For some reason, it was split into two at Chikubi's place.

247
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,560
That was amazing.

248
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,560
The teacher didn't say anything.

249
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:32,560
Sometimes, I drank water.

250
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,560
Why did you do that?

251
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,560
My throat was dry.

252
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,560
Because my nose kept drooping so much.

253
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,560
With your blue eyes.

254
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:43,560
Lastly, Matsumoto-san.

255
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,560
The pen name is Sarukko-san.

256
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,560
What is it?

257
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,560
I always enjoy watching your videos.

258
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,560
I have a suggestion for you.

259
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,560
The year has changed.

260
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:54,560
Why don't you make a new debayashi and watch it?

261
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,560
Well, I've always...

262
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:04,560
You've made all your debayashi, haven't you?

263
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,560
Yes, I have.

264
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,560
I think it's about time for me to change.

265
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,560
Really?

266
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,560
When I was watching the previous debayashi, you were satisfied with it, weren't you?

267
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,560
Yes, yes.

268
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,560
The previous debayashi, too.

269
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,560
Oh, when it came out.

270
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,560
That's right.

271
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,560
Are you sure you want to change it?

272
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:20,560
I've been using it a lot.

273
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,560
I've been using it a lot.

274
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:26,560
You don't look like you've seen most of the shows.

275
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,560
I've seen it.

276
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:33,560
You don't look like you've been involved in most of the shows.

277
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,560
If I could, I'd like to do it again next year.

278
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,560
That's fine.

279
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,560
I'll ask Mr. Matsumoto to make a new one.

280
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,560
No, no, no.

281
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:42,560
Then, shall we record it?

282
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,560
That's fast.

283
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,560
What kind of debayashi are you thinking of this time?

284
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:54,560
Well, I'd like to go with a Latin style.

285
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,560
You want to go with a Latin style?

286
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:02,560
Well, everyone is mixed up in a Latin style.

287
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,560
That's right.

288
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,560
Right?

289
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:08,560
It's not a subtle hair color.

290
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,560
It's a little purple.

291
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,560
It's a little purple.

292
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,560
Is it okay?

293
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,560
Is it okay to make it look fancy?

294
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,560
Well, it's a debayashi.

295
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,560
What was the previous one?

296
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:18,560
The one with Garigari-kun.

297
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:24,560
Oh, that's just a fake.

298
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,560
When I made it, I said it over and over again.

299
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:33,560
That's the worst.

300
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:37,560
You said Garigari-kun at the end.

301
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:40,560
I just happened to wear it.

302
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,560
You just happened to wear it.

303
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:46,560
It's not a question of which one is the previous one.

304
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:51,560
Then, please.

305
00:11:51,560 --> 00:12:01,560
Hitoshi is the Asian papillon.

306
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,560
You're wearing it again.

307
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,560
You're wearing it again.

308
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,560
What do you mean by again?

309
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,560
You're wearing it again.

310
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,560
What do you mean by again?

311
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:16,560
What's Hitoshi is the Asian papillon?

312
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,560
Then, I'll ask.

313
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,560
Then, I'll ask.

314
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:25,560
Isn't Hitoshi the Asian papillon?

315
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,560
If it's not, then I'll apologize.

316
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:33,560
Hitoshi is the Asian papillon until the video.

317
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,560
Then, I'll cry.

318
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,560
I'll cry.

319
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,560
No, no, no.

320
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,560
The music now is perfect.

321
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,560
It's not perfect.

322
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,560
I don't say it's perfect.

323
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,560
What is it?

324
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,560
I feel it.

325
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,560
Like this.

326
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:50,560
I don't know how many people are here today.

327
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,560
When you came out, I think you'll be like,

328
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,560
When you came out, I think you'll be like,

329
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:54,560
When you saw me, you'll be like,

330
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,560
When you saw me, you'll be like,

331
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:58,560
Oh, it's a papillon.

332
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,560
Where do you participate?

333
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,560
It's okay.

334
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,560
It's okay.

335
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,560
It's okay.

336
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,560
It's okay.

337
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:10,560
I can't participate in the papillon.

338
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,560
You can do whatever you want.

339
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,560
That's right.

340
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,560
Hitoshi is the Asian papillon.

341
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,560
Hitoshi is not the Asian papillon.

342
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:22,560
You're wrong, too.

343
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,560
I'll live for a while.

344
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,560
May I?

345
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:31,560
May I?

346
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,560
Don't write your ass in front of people.

347
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:34,560
Oh, oh.

348
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,560
Hitoshi is the Asian papillon.

349
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,560
Wait a minute.

350
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,560
Wait a minute.

351
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,560
You know what?

352
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,560
You know what?

353
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:44,560
It's embarrassing to be laughed at,

354
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:48,560
Hitoshi is so embarrassing.

355
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,560
A large-scale show.

356
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:53,560
Like, how far can we go?

357
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:54,560
I just did it.

358
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,560
Let's go as far as we can go.

359
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,560
It's like that.

360
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,560
It's okay, it's okay.

361
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,560
Really?

362
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,560
Oh, then you should participate.

363
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:02,560
What would you like to do?

364
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,560
Well, then.

365
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:04,560
Well, then.

366
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,560
Please be the papillon.

367
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,560
Your voice is in.

368
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:10,560
Then, you can be the voice.

369
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,560
It's okay to choose the voice.

370
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,560
That's not it!

371
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,560
You've been singing like this the whole time!

372
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,560
That's right, that's right.

373
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,560
It's not like this, it's really like this.

374
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,560
It has nothing to do with debayashi!

375
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,560
Please take care of that.

376
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,560
I'm really embarrassed.

377
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,560
You're embarrassed, but I'm embarrassed too!

378
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,560
Well, well, well.

379
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,560
Well, well, well.

380
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,560
That's really, really...

381
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,560
It's good, isn't it?

382
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,560
My face is a little dead.

383
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,560
It's better to have it alive.

384
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,560
It hurts.

385
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,560
That's why I'm going to say,

386
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,560
Itoshi wa Asia no Papillon.

387
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,560
Yes.

388
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,560
Then I'll say something.

389
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,560
Then you should come in while dancing.

390
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,560
Come in?

391
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,560
Well,

392
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,560
Come in solo.

393
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,560
Wow!

394
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,560
Come in.

395
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,560
Well, that's fine.

396
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,560
Itoshi wa Asia no Papillon.

397
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,560
Masatoshi wa Asia no Papillon.

398
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,560
You can come in.

399
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,560
No, I'm not a Papillon.

400
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,560
It's like,

401
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,560
I'm not listening!

402
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,560
It's like that.

403
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,560
What kind of debayashi are you?

404
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,560
Everyone doesn't understand!

405
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,560
It's cold!

406
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,560
That's fine.

407
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,560
Can you follow me?

408
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:12,560
But that's the moon in the dance.

409
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,560
It's not just you.

410
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,560
Papillon is like that.

411
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,560
If you follow me, I'll...

412
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,560
Hamada wa Asia no Papillon.

413
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:32,560
Then I'll come back right away.

414
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,560
That's why I'm dancing.

415
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,560
Are you okay?

416
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,560
Me?

417
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,560
Yes.

418
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,560
Itoshi wa Asia no...

419
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,560
That's right.

420
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,560
Itoshi wa Asia no Papillon.

421
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,560
Then?

422
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,560
Hamada wa Asia no Papillon.

423
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,560
Then you should come in.

424
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,560
Ah, Hamada mo is better.

425
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,560
Yes.

426
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,560
Hamada mo, yes.

427
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,560
It's okay?

428
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,560
Yes.

429
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,560
Even if you haven't danced for a long time,

430
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,560
I know you haven't been on stage.

431
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,560
I know that from the first time we met.

432
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:16,560
Ah, this person is not very happy.

433
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,560
That's...

434
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,560
Well, let's give it a try.

435
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,560
Let's see if you can really dance.

436
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,560
It doesn't matter if you dance.

437
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,560
It's just this part, right?

438
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:30,560
What kind of way of thinking is that?

439
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,560
What kind of way of thinking is that?

440
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,560
Why are you saying that?

441
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,560
It's not like that.

442
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,560
After all, if you listen to the song,

443
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,560
you'll know that you're dancing.

444
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:44,560
That's something that comes from your consciousness.

445
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,560
Ah, you're dancing.

446
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:50,560
I want you to feel that you're dancing.

447
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,560
Itoshi wa Asia no Papillon.

448
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,560
Itoshi wa Asia no Papillon.

449
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,560
Come on!

450
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,560
Ah, yes.

451
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,560
Ah, it's already started, right?

452
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:02,560
Come on, dance!

453
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,560
Come on, dance properly!

454
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,560
Come on, dance properly!

455
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,560
Is that okay?

456
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,560
You really don't have any talent for dancing.

457
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,560
Why are you doing that?

458
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,560
Why are you doing that?

459
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,560
Itoshi wa Asia no Papillon.

460
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,560
Itoshi wa Asia no Papillon.

461
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,560
What?

462
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,560
Itoshi wa Asia no Papillon.

463
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,560
What?

464
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:28,560
You're just doing it randomly.

465
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,560
The previous one had a base,

466
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,560
and it was solid, right?

467
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:34,560
Ah, yes, yes.

468
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,560
The tempo was good.

469
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,560
That's right.

470
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,560
You changed that, so you did it well.

471
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,560
Ah, yes, yes.

472
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:44,560
You only have that one phrase.

473
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,560
That's not true.

474
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,560
What are you saying?

475
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,560
Itoshi wa Asia no Papillon.

476
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,560
Hamada mo Asia no Papillon.

477
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,560
Hamada mo Asia no Papillon.

478
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,560
It's already finished.

479
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,560
It's already finished.

480
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,560
But,

481
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:02,560
But, I still love my mom.

482
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,560
But, I still love my mom.

483
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,560
But, I still love my mom.

484
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,560
But, I still love my mom.

485
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,560
Ah, yes.

486
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,560
Then what's the answer?

487
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,560
Why can't I think of the answer first?

488
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,560
Ah, I said something that's not consistent.

489
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,560
Ah, I said something that's not consistent.

490
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,560
That's strange.

491
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,560
I'm doing it with cheap gyalas.

492
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,560
It's not gyalas.

493
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:26,560
Is that so?

494
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,560
Then, let's do the song.

495
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,560
Then, let's do the song.

496
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,560
Then, Masatoshi, Hamada,

497
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,560
then, Masatoshi, Hamada, please do Asia no Papillon.

498
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,560
Then, I'll do it.

499
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,560
But, I still love my mom.

500
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,560
But, I still love my mom.

501
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,560
But, I still love my mom.

502
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,560
But, I still love my mom.

503
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,560
Then you can write one.

504
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,560
I'm fine writing with you.

505
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,560
Then, we're going to change it, if you like.

506
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,560
Then, we're going to change it, if you like.

507
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,560
Then, we're going to change it.

508
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,560
Just write it.

509
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,560
Just for now, just remember one.

510
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,560
Just for now, just remember one.

511
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:17,560
What the hell is that?

512
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,560
Ah, I got it!

513
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,560
Can I do it in a heavy metal style?

514
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,560
Can you do it?

515
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,560
I can do it.

516
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:24,560
You can do it?

517
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:25,560
I can do it.

518
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:26,560
Then let me hear it.

519
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:36,560
I left one of the previous ones.

520
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:37,560
What are you going to do?

521
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:39,560
No, no, it's fine.

522
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:41,560
I haven't completed the heavy metal style at all.

523
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:43,560
Let me complete it.

524
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,560
How did you complete it?

525
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:49,560
If you say ah, I'll say ah too.

526
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:50,560
Really?

527
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:56,560
Ah!

528
00:20:56,560 --> 00:21:01,560
I can't put my tongue out.

529
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,560
It's quite embarrassing, isn't it?

530
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:06,560
As expected, the Asian papillon is fine.

531
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:09,560
The Asian papillon, Udemoto.

532
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:13,560
No, the Asian papillon is fine.

533
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,560
I've never been to Asia.

534
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,560
Can I have an Asian papillon for one year?

535
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:18,560
Please.

536
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:21,560
Then why don't you come in?

537
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:23,560
Yes, right away.

538
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:26,560
Ah, it's been a while since we talked like this.

539
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:31,560
Right?

540
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:32,560
It's been a while?

541
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,560
No, this is the center mic.

542
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,560
Ah, is that so?

543
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:38,560
Well, it's fine.

544
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:43,560
Perhaps, that is...

545
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:46,560
It's fine.

546
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:47,560
I'm going!

547
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:48,560
Yes, then please.

548
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,560
In the end, please.

549
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:52,560
Please say it without laughing.

550
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:53,560
Ah, that's right.

551
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,560
Everyone, I'm sorry, but please.

552
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:57,560
Please say it in seconds.

553
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,560
I'm going.

554
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:00,560
5 seconds.

555
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:03,560
4, 3, 2, 1.

556
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:04,560
Cue!

557
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:07,560
One year, the Asian papillon!

558
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:08,560
Ah, it's still the same.

559
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:12,560
What are you doing?

560
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:14,560
The sense of rhythm is zero.

561
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:18,560
What are you doing?

562
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:21,560
Come in quickly.

563
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,560
3, 2, 1, cue!

564
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:24,560
One year, the Asian papillon!

565
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,560
One year, the Asian papillon!

566
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:29,560
Ah, it's still the same.

567
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:32,560
You have to do this.

568
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:35,560
If you had this, you would have done it.

569
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:37,560
Let's do it properly.

570
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:38,560
You have to do it properly.

571
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:39,560
You have to do it properly.

572
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,560
You have to do it properly.

573
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,560
Let's do it properly.

574
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:49,560
One year, the Asian papillon!

575
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:55,560
You should have said that to me first.

576
00:22:55,560 --> 00:23:04,560
I said it was one year, and you said it was one year, so it's not wrong.

577
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:09,560
Come on, let's do it properly.

578
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:11,560
Hitoshi is an Asian papillon.

579
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:13,560
Hamada is an Asian papillon.

580
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:17,560
But I still love my mama.

581
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,560
OK!

582
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:25,560
OK? Thank you.

583
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:27,560
Let's listen to it.

584
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:28,560
Right away?

585
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:29,560
Right away.

586
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:30,560
Let's listen.

587
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,560
Hitoshi is an Asian papillon.

588
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,560
Hamada is an Asian papillon.

589
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:37,560
But I still love my mama.

590
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:40,560
Why is this like a training room?

591
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:43,560
I don't know.

592
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:44,560
Why is this recording?

593
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:45,560
It's OK.

594
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:47,560
You're going to fall from the bottom of the van.

595
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,560
Adam?

596
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:52,560
I'm going to fall from the top of the van.

597
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,560
That's funny.

598
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:56,560
Why is this recording?

599
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,560
I'm going to fall.
