1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
In the 1st episode of Gaki no Tsukai Arahen, Chikichiki Telekura Daisakusei!

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
What's up?

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
We're in a store called Uiz in Ikebukuro.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Even though it was popular a while ago, it's still booming.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
If you really make a promise, it'll come true.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Everyone can feel that with their own skin.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
This is different from the usual opening.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
It's totally different.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
The staff is like a tracking staff.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
You're so good!

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Please come in and let's do a challenge.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Please come in!

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Yamada-kun, you're coming in too?

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Do your best.

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Masato-kun.

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Actually, this monitor...

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
The height of the 4th room...

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
That room is being filmed.

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I'm setting up a hidden camera.

20
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Of course you don't know the height.

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I don't know.

22
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Actually, I asked a girl to call Takasukun.

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I asked her to make an appointment with me.

24
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I like you.

25
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I like you too.

26
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I think Takasukun will be quiet.

27
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I think he'll meet that girl.

28
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I see.

29
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
That's what I asked the tracking staff to do today.

30
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
You're a pervert.

31
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The other members...

32
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I don't really know Takasukun, but...

33
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I think he'll meet that girl today.

34
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
That's what I think.

35
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
So, Aoshima-san and Chika Takami will do the VTR.

36
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
That's right.

37
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:47,000
This program is brought to you by these sponsors.

38
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I won.

39
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I won.

40
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Where are you?

41
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Where do you live?

42
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Where I live?

43
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I'm in Otsuka.

44
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Otsuka?

45
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Yes.

46
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I see.

47
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
You know a lot.

48
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
What are you talking about?

49
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Right now?

50
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
My company is closed today.

51
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I was told to call you, so I'll call you.

52
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Really?

53
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Do you call often?

54
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Not that often.

55
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
You're asking a lot of questions.

56
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Do you talk to everyone?

57
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I'm in Otsuka.

58
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Minamiguchi?

59
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Minamiguchi?

60
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Yes.

61
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I see.

62
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I understand.

63
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Really?

64
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Yes.

65
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I'm in Otsuka.

66
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I'm in Otsuka.

67
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Really?

68
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Minamiguchi.

69
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I'm in Otsuka.

70
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I'm alone.

71
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Oh, you?

72
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I'm sorry.

73
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I'm still working hard.

74
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Seriously.

75
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
You're amazing.

76
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Who do you look like?

77
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
You're amazing.

78
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
You're cool.

79
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
You're cool.

80
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Who?

81
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
You're cool.

82
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Who?

83
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Taishu Kase.

84
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
You're so funny.

85
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
You're funny.

86
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
You're funny.

87
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
You're funny.

88
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Do I really look like you?

89
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I don't think so.

90
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
You're cool.

91
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Don't say my name.

92
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I'm just so happy to hear it.

93
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
You're coming?

94
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Yes.

95
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
She's not coming?

96
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
She's not coming?

97
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
You're funny.

98
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Are you at home.

99
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Yes.

100
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Around 10?

101
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Yes.

102
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Let's meet somewhere at 10.

103
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
You said that we were meeting at 8.

104
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
It's not 10 o'clock, is it?

105
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Well, you know...

106
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I'd like to meet you, but...

107
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I might be lying, but...

108
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I used to be a fan of yours.

109
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
By the way, I...

110
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Well...

111
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I can't meet you at 10 o'clock.

112
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
It's okay.

113
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Do you know where the station is at 10 o'clock?

114
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Yes.

115
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
What are you going to wear?

116
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I'm going to wear a white polo shirt and a navy skirt.

117
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I'm going to wear a navy skirt and a navy skirt.

118
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
You're definitely coming, aren't you?

119
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I'm going. I'm going.

120
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Yes.

121
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I'm definitely coming.

122
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Yes.

123
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I'm waiting for you.

124
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
All right.

125
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Now, let's report the results of the test.

126
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I'm the only one.

127
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
One?

128
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I'm the only one.

129
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
How old are you?

130
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I'm 21 years old.

131
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
You must have been nervous.

132
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
162 years old.

133
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
In college.

134
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I'm 21 years old.

135
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
How many tests did you take?

136
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I took three tests.

137
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I'm the only one.

138
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I'm the only one. At 8 o'clock.

139
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I'm sorry.

140
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
How did you do it?

141
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I'm the only one.

142
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
You're really the only one.

143
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
You're really the only one.

144
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
And you said you'd be waiting for me at 8 o'clock on the show.

145
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
10 o'clock.

146
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I have to wait until 4 o'clock.

147
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
What?

148
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
In front of Osaka Station.

149
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Was it Minamiguchi?

150
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Yes.

151
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I'll go now and see if there's anyone waiting for me.

152
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
All right.

153
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I'll go.

154
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Good luck.

155
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Welcome back.

156
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Welcome back.

157
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
What about you, Takasu?

158
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I didn't have enough time.

159
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I didn't ask.

160
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I see.

161
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
It can't be helped.

162
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Good luck.

163
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
There he is.

164
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
There he is.

165
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
There he is.

166
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
He's white.

167
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
He's white, so I can see what's going on.

168
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
There he is.

169
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
He's a fool.

170
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I'm making him fool around.

171
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
How many tests did you take?

172
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I took 21 tests.

173
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
21 tests?

174
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
He's talking.

175
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
He's talking.

176
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I'm asking for your name.

177
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
My name is Tomo.

178
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Tomo.

179
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Tomo.

180
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
My name is Tomo.

181
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
He's talking to someone I know.

182
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
He's desperate to find me.

183
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
It's perfect.

184
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
He's a fool.

185
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
He looks like Tsukou-san.

186
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
He looks like Tsukou-san.

187
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
He's a fool.

188
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I'm waiting for you, old man.

189
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
His knees are shining.

190
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
His knees are shining.

191
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I'm not surprised at all.

192
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I'm really impressed.

193
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I'm really impressed.

194
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I'm not surprised.

195
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
He's really big.

196
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
He's really big.

197
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I'm going to open up a strike zone for you.

198
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
You can take a break.

199
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
You can take a break.

200
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
We can play.

201
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
What are you talking about?

202
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
What are you talking about?

203
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
You can take a break.

204
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
We can play.

205
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
We can take a break.

206
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
You can take a break.

207
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
You're a fool.

208
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
You're a fool.

209
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Even if I come out that way, they'll definitely be able to see me from here.

210
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I can come in that way.

211
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
It's over there, isn't it?

212
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
There's a person on the 4th floor.

213
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
He's trying to go over there.

214
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
He's trying to go over there.

215
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I can't go over there.

216
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
How is it?

217
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I'm going to go there.

218
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

219
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I don't think he'll come out.

220
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
You don't think he'll come out?

221
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
That's a swear word.

222
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
That's a swear word.

223
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I'm asking you.

224
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
It's hard to pull more than that.

225
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I don't think he'll come out.

226
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
That's what I'm talking about.

227
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
That's what you're talking about.

228
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
You don't think he'll come out?

229
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I don't think so.

230
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
You don't think he'll come out?

231
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
That's a swear word.

232
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Let's look over there.

233
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Which way?

234
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
From over there.

235
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
That's not it.

236
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Let's wait a little longer.

237
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I don't think he'll come out.

238
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I don't think he'll come out.

239
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
That's a swear word.

240
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
That's a swear word.

241
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
It's definitely this way.

242
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:27,000
This is the first time I've seen this kind of thing, so I'm not sure if it's a good idea or not, but I think it's a good idea to try it out and see how it goes.

243
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I'm not sure if it's a good idea to try it out and see how it goes, but I think it's a good idea to try it out and see how it goes.

244
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:46,000
However, this is a horrible thing, so it's probably okay.

245
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:56,000
I'm not sure if it's a good idea to try it out and see how it goes, but I think it's a good idea to try it out and see how it goes.

246
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I'm not sure if it's a good idea to try it out and see how it goes, but I think it's a good idea to try it out and see how it goes.

247
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
It's a little bit difficult to see.

248
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,800
I'm sorry.

249
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,800
What does it mean?

250
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,800
I'm sorry.

251
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,800
I'm sorry.

252
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,800
I'm sorry.

253
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,800
I'm sorry.

254
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,800
I'm sorry.

255
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,800
I'm sorry.

256
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,800
I'm sorry.

257
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,800
I'm sorry.

258
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,800
Do you know Takahashi?

259
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,800
I don't know.

260
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,800
I don't know.

261
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:32,800
I don't know.

262
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:40,800
I don't know.

263
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,800
I'm sorry.

264
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,800
I'm sorry.

265
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,800
I'm sorry.

266
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,800
I'm sorry.

267
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,800
I'm sorry.

268
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,800
I'm sorry.

269
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,800
Ouch!

270
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,800
Ouch!

271
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,800
Ouch!

272
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,800
Ouch!

273
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,800
No way!

274
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,800
That's for sure!

275
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,800
I've never seen anyone with that face.

276
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,800
I'm not eating this!

277
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,800
I'm on the other side of the road.

278
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,800
I'm on the other side of the road.

279
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,800
I'm on the other side of the road.

280
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,800
I'm on the other side of the road.

281
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,800
What's wrong with you, Takatsu-san?

282
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,800
Takatsu-san!

283
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,800
Takatsu-san!

284
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,800
Stop it!

285
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,800
Stop it!

286
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,800
Stop it!

287
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,800
Stop it!

288
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,800
Takatsu-san!

289
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,800
Takatsu-san!

290
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,800
Why did you say that?

291
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,800
Why did you say that?

292
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,800
Stop it!

293
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,800
That's not cool.

294
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,800
That's not cool.

295
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,800
That's not cool.

296
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,800
That's not cool.

297
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,800
That's not cool.

298
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,800
All the voices are here.

299
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,800
All the voices are here.

300
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,300
Come here! Come here!

301
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:28,300
You're crying, aren't you?

302
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:30,300
Yeah, my eyes are a bit dirty.

303
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:31,300
Ah, I can't take this anymore.

304
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:34,800
Usually, people who ride a horse that much and go home are usually lonely.

305
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,800
Why is this happening to me?

306
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,800
I've been tricked!

307
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,300
The camera is here, so face the camera.

308
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:42,800
1, 2, 3, go!

309
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:45,800
Stop it! Stop it! Let's go home!

310
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:58,800
Thank you very much! Thank you very much!

311
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,800
Thank you very much!

312
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,800
Well, you know...

313
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,800
I'm sure you're all doing well.

314
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:06,800
That's right.

315
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,800
Well, you know, everyone, this program,

316
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:13,800
I think we've had quite a few meetings.

317
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,800
Ah, probably.

318
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,800
Really, you guys, you have to show yourself.

319
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:18,800
Show what?

320
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:23,800
The golf story before the actual show.

321
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:24,800
What?

322
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:25,800
What is it?

323
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,800
What?

324
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,800
What?

325
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:30,800
What are you guys doing?

326
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,800
It's not like we have a meeting on this program.

327
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,800
We don't have one, but it's like,

328
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,800
what's going on over there?

329
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,800
This has nothing to do with it!

330
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,800
It's annoying!

331
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,800
Well, we have a lot of staff,

332
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,800
so if you want to come in,

333
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,800
we can have a downtown party.

334
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,800
We can have a competition,

335
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,800
with all the staff.

336
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,800
But you can't come in!

337
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,800
You can't do anything!

338
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,800
You can't do that!

339
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:00,800
You can't!

340
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,800
You can't!

341
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:02,800
Okay, I get it.

342
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,800
If you want to put that kind of ball in the hole,

343
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:08,800
I've put in as many balls as you want!

344
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,800
I've put a lot of balls in the box!

345
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,800
That's enough!

346
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,800
But, you know,

347
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:19,800
putting it in like this isn't fun.

348
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,800
It's more fun to sell it and put it in.

349
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,800
I've put in a lot of balls.

350
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,800
If this feels good,

351
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,800
you don't have to put it in from a distance.

352
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,800
You can just run and put it in.

353
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:32,800
Yes, yes!

354
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,800
That's the most fun!

355
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:35,800
Yes, yes!

356
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:36,800
Yes, yes!

357
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,800
Yes, yes!

358
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:38,800
If that's the case,

359
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,800
I'll go out once.

360
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,800
I can still accept tennis.

361
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,800
I'm good at tennis.

362
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:50,800
Seriously.

363
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,800
Why can't you say that?

364
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,800
I can use both hands.

365
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,800
I don't need the opposite hand.

366
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,800
You don't need this?

367
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,800
If you don't have a backhand, you don't have it.

368
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,800
If you come from this side, you can take it to this side.

369
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:03,800
If you come from this side, you can take it to this side.

370
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,800
Don't say such a good thing!

371
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,800
Try putting in balls.

372
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,800
If you come like this, you can put it in like this.

373
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:10,800
If you come like this, you can put it in like this.

374
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,800
If you come like this, you can put it in like this.

375
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,800
Do you have the will to do it?

376
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,800
You can't even make a mistake!

377
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:24,800
Let's play next time.

378
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:25,800
Let's play.

379
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,800
We can do an opening.

380
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:28,800
That's right.

381
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:29,800
So stop playing golf.

382
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:30,800
It doesn't matter.

383
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:31,800
Leave me alone.

384
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,800
You all like baseball, right?

385
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,800
I like baseball too.

386
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:39,800
Baseball is stupid.

387
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:45,800
I don't think baseball is as cool as it is when it's sandwiched.

388
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,800
It's lame!

389
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,800
That's because it's in the back of the net.

390
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:02,800
It's sandwiched between the ball going this way and going that way.

391
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,800
It's sandwiched between the ball going this way and going that way.

392
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:06,800
You can't run away from it.

393
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,800
It can't be helped.

394
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:11,800
What does the ball actually mean?

395
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:14,800
What do you mean by that?

396
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,800
The beginning of baseball is...

397
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:20,800
I don't know if you know about the ball, but I'm going to make a bomb statement here.

398
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,800
What does the baseball ball actually mean?

399
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,800
It's about poop.

400
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,800
The beginning is poop.

401
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:28,800
Did you know that?

402
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:33,800
It's a story from an era when baseball wasn't even a thing.

403
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:36,800
One day, Mela Rekko threw poop.

404
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,800
It was dirty, so she hit it back with a stick.

405
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,800
That's how baseball started.

406
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:45,800
That's definitely a lie.

407
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:46,800
It's true!

408
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:50,800
That's why she threw poop and it ended up like this.

409
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:54,800
She threw poop and it was dirty, so she ran away.

410
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,800
That's right. That's the beginning.

411
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,800
That's not true!

412
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:02,800
If you follow the original shape of sports, it's really embarrassing.

413
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,800
What else is there in sports?

414
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,800
There's a lot of sports.

415
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:07,800
Swimming.

416
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:10,800
What?

417
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,800
Why are you desperately swimming?

418
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:24,800
Originally, humans were fish.

419
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:25,800
What?

420
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:27,800
Huh?

421
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,800
You don't know?

422
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:31,800
No, I don't know.

423
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:34,800
Before monkeys, they were fish.

424
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,800
What kind of fish were they?

425
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:43,800
They were mackerel.

426
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:51,800
They were mackerel?

427
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:52,800
They were mackerel.

428
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,800
From mackerel, they became monkeys.

429
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:58,800
What?

430
00:18:58,800 --> 00:18:59,800
What do you mean?

431
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:00,800
What?

432
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,800
Their faces are completely different.

433
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:04,800
That's right.

434
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,800
How did they evolve?

435
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:10,800
They were monkeys, and they had this kind of face.

436
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,800
So mackerel swim like this.

437
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:17,800
And there was a guy who wanted to go out.

438
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:22,800
He wanted to go up to the land.

439
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:25,800
One of the mackerels thought that.

440
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,800
There were so many unpleasant things.

441
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,800
In the sea?

442
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,800
There were so many unpleasant things in the sea.

443
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,800
It was boring.

444
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:33,800
That's right.

445
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:34,800
Go up!

446
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,800
That's why he wanted to swim.

447
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,800
I don't agree with that.

448
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:43,800
You can't do this as a joke.

449
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:47,800
If you go up to the land now, you'll be a monkey.

450
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,800
Please stop playing golf.

451
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:55,800
That's all I ask of you.

452
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:56,800
That's great.

453
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,800
Let's go once.

454
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,800
What?

455
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:00,800
Once.

456
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:01,800
You can't do that.

457
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,800
I'll do it.

458
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,800
I'll do it.

459
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:05,800
Let's go once.

460
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,800
Hey!

461
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,800
I've told you so many times.

462
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,800
You can't do that.

463
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,800
How much money does he have?

464
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:17,800
I don't have money except for you.

465
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,800
The staff gave me a lot of money.

466
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,800
But you're the only one.

467
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:27,800
You're like a child who did something bad.

468
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:29,800
What?

469
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,800
That's not true.

470
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,800
I'm not like that.

471
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:38,800
I'm not a person who was born with sex.

472
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:40,800
I'm telling you clearly.

473
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:41,800
Really?

474
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:42,800
That's right.

475
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,800
How did you come into this world?

476
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,800
What are you talking about?

477
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:46,800
How did you come into this world?

478
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:47,800
Me?

479
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,800
Who are you?

480
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,800
I'm an angel.

481
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:55,800
I'm an angel.

482
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,800
Are you that kind of person?

483
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,800
Do you always have wings?

484
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:03,800
That's okay.

485
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,800
Show me.

486
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:07,800
Show me now.

487
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,800
Your wings.

488
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:13,800
Show me your wings.

489
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:17,800
If you want to show your wings, you have to fly.

490
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,800
You can fly.

491
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:20,800
You can only fly.

492
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,800
You can only fly.

493
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:23,800
It's okay.

494
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,800
I'm an angel.

495
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:28,800
Your butt is round.

496
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,800
That's not cool.

497
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:35,800
You can fly, but you can't show your wings.

498
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:39,800
If you show your wings, your butt will be round.

499
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,800
That's an angel.

500
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,800
Your pants are open.

501
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:44,800
Your pants.

502
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:48,800
Your butt is round and you have wings.

503
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:49,800
I want to see it someday.

504
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:50,800
You want to see it someday?

505
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,800
Yes.

506
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:54,800
I want to fly at the opening.

507
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,800
Look outside.

508
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:59,800
If you fly outside, you can fly freely.

509
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,800
But you can't turn the camera.

510
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,800
Why?

511
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:05,800
Because the radio is round.

512
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:08,800
I'll blur it.

513
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,800
That's not cool.

514
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:14,800
You blur the angel wings.

515
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:17,800
How do you show your wings?

516
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,800
That's an angel.

517
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,800
It's romantic.

518
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:25,800
Can you show your wings like this?

519
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,800
It's cute.

520
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,800
You're an angel.

521
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:30,800
Really?

522
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,800
How do you show your wings?

523
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:33,800
Like this.

524
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,800
It's scary.

525
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:39,800
Matsumoto.

526
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:40,800
Yes.

527
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,800
Today's opening was great.

528
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,800
Takasu's dirtiness.

529
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:47,800
That guy.

530
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,800
He's here.

531
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,800
How long have you been working with him?

532
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:56,800
I've been working with him for 20 years.

533
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,800
He's a tough guy.

534
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,800
He kept quiet.

535
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,800
He didn't tell me anything.

536
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,800
The guy who usually rides your car and goes home.

537
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,800
He's not here today.

538
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:07,800
What are you talking about?

539
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:08,800
What did he do?

540
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,800
He's alone.

541
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,800
You're lying.

542
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:15,800
Takasu, you look like Taishu Kaze.

543
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,800
You're lying.

544
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:22,800
Assistant.

545
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,800
Everything is the same.

546
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,800
What kind of writing do you want?

547
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,800
I'll be waiting.

548
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,800
I'll wash your armpits.

549
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:31,800
Goodbye.

550
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:36,800
I'm surrounded by amazing staff.

551
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:41,800
Thank you.
