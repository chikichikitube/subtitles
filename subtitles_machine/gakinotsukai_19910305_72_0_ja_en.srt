1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
I asked 100 people around the world.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
What do you think?

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Today, I'd like to use this opportunity to ask you a lot of questions.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I see, I see.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
How many people are there?

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
100 people.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
100 people.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
How many men are there?

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:32,000
If you are a man, please press the button.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
26 people?

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
26 people have men?

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
26 people have men?

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
27?

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
What is it?

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Get out of here.

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm just looking at you.

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Everyone is laughing, but it's true.

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:09,000
This program is brought to you by Lions.

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
This program is brought to you by these sponsors.

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Let's ask the young women.

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
If the maximum amount of money you've ever received from a man is more than 50,000 yen, please press the button.

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Why are you giving me little by little?

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I want to press it.

24
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Are you underestimating me?

25
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
You should be honest.

26
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
You should apply to the government.

27
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Why?

28
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Who are you talking to?

29
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
This is a conscious survey.

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
It's still increasing.

31
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
This is a conscious survey of young people.

32
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Young people?

33
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Are you an entertainer?

34
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
This is a conscious survey of young people.

35
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I'll do my best.

36
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
But I think this machine is different.

37
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Why don't you change the question?

38
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I'll change the question, but you have to press the button.

39
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
What is this?

40
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Are you a twin?

41
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I don't think so.

42
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
It's not a machine that can be used properly.

43
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
It's probably a bird's nest.

44
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I'm watching you.

45
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Even if you use it like this, you can see it with your naked eyes.

46
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
It's a long distance, so you have to look at it with your hands.

47
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:47,000
It's a bird's nest.

48
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:53,000
If you are picked up by a celebrity you admire in the street, how far are you okay?

49
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
If you give me your phone number, I'll tell you.

50
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:05,000
There are a lot of people.

51
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
It's okay.

52
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:13,000
It's okay as far as you can go.

53
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Don't stop.

54
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
It's about half.

55
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Let's ask who it is.

56
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
For example, who is it?

57
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Hideki.

58
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
If it's Hideki, I'll do it.

59
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
If it's Hideki, I'll do it.

60
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
If it's okay, I'll do it.

61
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Switch on.

62
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
It's Hideki.

63
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Hideki, welcome.

64
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Taishu Kase.

65
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Zero.

66
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I want you to do it.

67
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Wait a minute.

68
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
There are 30 people, but there is no man.

69
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
What should I do with this man?

70
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
It's okay to be picked up.

71
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Men are okay, so it's okay to be picked up by Kase.

72
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Switch on.

73
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
It's not as much as I thought.

74
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Let's go with only men.

75
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Kase will pick you up.

76
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Leave it to Kase.

77
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I'll leave it to Kase.

78
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
It's your lead.

79
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Switch on.

80
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
It's not as much as I thought.

81
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
It's not as much as I thought.

82
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
There is a chance that Hamada will win against Taishu Kase.

83
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
There is a chance that Hamada will win against Taishu Kase.

84
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
What?

85
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Hamada.

86
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Let's do it with me.

87
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Switch on.

88
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
You?

89
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
There is a chance that Hamada will win against me.

90
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Is it okay, sir?

91
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Wait a minute.

92
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Are you sure?

93
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Me and you.

94
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
There is a chance that Hamada will win against me.

95
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Switch on.

96
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
We will do a good job.

97
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
What do you think?

98
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I see.

99
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
That's good.

100
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I'm thinking of continuing this program.

101
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
It's good that I won against Taishu Kase.

102
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Let's listen to the last part.

103
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
With Masumoto.

104
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Switch on.

105
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
It doesn't matter anymore.

106
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
It's almost half and half.

107
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
What?

108
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I don't know if it's a man.

109
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Who do you think I am?

110
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Me.

111
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Me.

112
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:31,000
There are more people who think I'm a homo than those who want to do it with me.

113
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I haven't been told the truth.

114
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I haven't been told the truth recently.

115
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I've been told not to say it on TV.

116
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I'm watching TV.

117
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
It's a man.

118
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I knew it.

119
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Ladies and gentlemen.

120
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Hello.

121
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I didn't have to make you wait.

122
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I'm here to change your clothes.

123
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
That's why I asked you to come today.

124
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Three or four weeks in advance.

125
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Really?

126
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
How many people are there?

127
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Two?

128
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Two.

129
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
There are only two.

130
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
How many people are you looking for?

131
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
28.

132
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
28?

133
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Hey.

134
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
It's one difference from us.

135
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Is that so?

136
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
It's crazy.

137
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
It's crazy.

138
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,000
You look like a peanut.

139
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
It's a difficult story.

140
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
It's a difficult story.

141
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
It's not difficult.

142
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I saw a photo of Kanako Higuchi.

143
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Yes.

144
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
It's amazing.

145
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
She's bald.

146
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
She's bald.

147
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I want to share it with her.

148
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I want to share it with her.

149
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
It was amazing.

150
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Really?

151
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
That's you.

152
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Look.

153
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I'm not looking.

154
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
You should look.

155
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
There's one more person.

156
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
What?

157
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
There's one more person.

158
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
How old are you?

159
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I'm 23.

160
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
You don't have to worry about it.

161
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
You don't have to worry about it.

162
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
It's crazy.

163
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
What's with the strong bangs?

164
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
This is...

165
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
There are many people like this.

166
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
But it's a little forced.

167
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
My hair is like this, but I'm like this.

168
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
It's like a Matsuyama Chiharu.

169
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
23 years old.

170
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
You're young.

171
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
You should do your best.

172
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I remember it's crazy.

173
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I was about 20 years old.

174
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
It's early.

175
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I'm okay.

176
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Are you okay?

177
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I'm okay.

178
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I'm okay.

179
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I'm okay.

180
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I'm okay.

181
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I'm okay.

182
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I'm okay.

183
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I'm okay.

184
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I'm okay.

185
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I'm okay.

186
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I'm fine.

187
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Please watch theactions from now on.

188
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Please watch it.

189
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,000
There's a story about putting this kind of stuff out there.

190
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
It's like putting a nude photo of me on the governor.

191
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
It's a penalty.

192
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
The governor of staola

193
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
That part hasn't disappeared yet.

194
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
That part even.

195
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
If you lose again?

196
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Yes.

197
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Semi-nude

198
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,400
I've made a lot of mistakes, but there are still a lot of mysterious parts of you that are still hidden.

199
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:34,700
I didn't make that many mistakes on purpose, so if you like it, you can do it in the world of SM.

200
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,700
I don't do it because I like it.

201
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:39,400
You like to show it to people, don't you?

202
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,100
There's a little bit of exposure.

203
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:42,600
There is, isn't there?

204
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:56,500
I light up the radio studio and light up the cigarette and light up the rubber.

205
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,800
What should I say?

206
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,700
You have a pretty strong body.

207
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,000
Where is it?

208
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,300
Don't tell me.

209
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,800
I'm pretty busy.

210
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,900
Where is it?

211
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:09,000
It's like this here.

212
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,700
Well, that's fine, but it's been a while since I've been in February.

213
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:16,500
For example, what happened in February?

214
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,000
What?

215
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,600
What happened?

216
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,300
First of all...

217
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:19,700
What do you mean, what happened?

218
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:23,400
What happened? I'm asking you at this distance.

219
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:26,500
What happened? Well, for example, today...

220
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,000
What?

221
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,400
Today, I dropped my wallet.

222
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,400
What?

223
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,100
Your wallet?

224
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,000
When you came from Osaka?

225
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Yes.

226
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
In the Shinkansen?

227
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,400
I dropped it in the license plate.

228
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:43,200
I've picked up the money, but the amount I dropped was about 1 million yen.

229
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,700
And it was taken from the dressing room.

230
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,600
It was taken from the dressing room.

231
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,800
There's someone who takes it from the dressing room.

232
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,100
It was stolen about 200,000 yen.

233
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:52,700
Really, really.

234
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:53,500
From the bank.

235
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,300
I don't care about the dressing room.

236
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:56,800
Well, I'm on stage now, so it's okay.

237
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:01,000
Hey!

238
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,700
You're not as cheap as you look now.

239
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:08,700
You're not as cheap as you look now.

240
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:11,900
I was so angry on the Shinkansen today.

241
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:12,400
Oh, really?

242
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,800
I was so angry.

243
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,500
And I always sit at the window seat.

244
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,200
I don't know that.

245
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,300
I only sit at the window seat.

246
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:18,800
Yes, yes, yes.

247
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:25,000
When I got on the seat, there was a man who looked like an elite with white hair.

248
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,600
He was sitting there with a newspaper or a foreign book.

249
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,900
He looked like a gentleman.

250
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:36,400
So I said, excuse me.

251
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,000
He said, excuse me?

252
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I'm not sitting on my seat.

253
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,100
Yes, yes, yes.

254
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,500
He suddenly changed.

255
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,800
What's wrong with him?

256
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,500
I sat down and looked at my bag.

257
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,500
I realized I didn't have a wallet.

258
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,200
I had some time before I left.

259
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,200
I thought I might have forgotten it at the store.

260
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,100
I was running around.

261
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:55,600
It wouldn't be funny if I came back and went to the Shinkansen.

262
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,800
I went to the store with my bag.

263
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,900
But I didn't have it.

264
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:01,000
I had no choice but to take the Shinkansen.

265
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,500
When I came back, he was still sitting there with me.

266
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,900
I was angry.

267
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:08,900
I'm not angry.

268
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:10,400
And he said something.

269
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,900
I looked at him and said,

270
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:14,600
Aren't you going to sit down?

271
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:22,100
What is it? What is it?

272
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:26,100
While I was saying that, my teeth started to hurt.

273
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:28,900
It was terrible.

274
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:32,000
It was the last time I saw a strange man and my teeth started to hurt.

275
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,500
That's not all, you idiot.

276
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:36,800
I was so angry that I couldn't say anything else.

277
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,300
I went to the plantain store in Osaka.

278
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,800
I went to the plantain store with my business card.

279
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,100
I'm not angry.

280
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:48,600
An ugly woman is choosing her underwear.

281
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:52,700
That's because I'm wearing white underwear.

282
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:53,700
You're an idiot.

283
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:57,600
You're an ugly woman.

284
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,800
You're an ugly woman.

285
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:05,500
You're an ugly woman.

286
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:08,400
You're an ugly woman.

287
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:12,600
There's a part of him that he shows off to someone.

288
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:18,500
If you go out with a friend like that, you'll be satisfied, right?

289
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:21,400
You can't show your underwear to a man.

290
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,600
It's like that to some extent.

291
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,800
It's like choosing silk.

292
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,800
There's no way I can show you that.

293
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:31,900
There's no way I can show you that.

294
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:36,100
It's a secret.

295
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:38,200
You're the most beautiful woman in the world.

296
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:43,200
You're the most beautiful woman in the world.

297
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:46,400
You don't look at him.

298
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:49,200
I'm surprised.

299
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:52,100
You're like a camera.

300
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:54,200
You're amazing.

301
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,800
You're an ugly woman who's bet on Tessio.

302
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,800
Who's bet on Tessio?

303
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,300
Who raised you?

304
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:02,400
He's already chosen.

305
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,100
He's already chosen the last two types.

306
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:08,700
He's already chosen the last two types.

307
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:17,500
I'm a little flustered.

308
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:24,600
I'm a little flustered.

309
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:28,200
I wanted to see that.

310
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:28,700
What?

311
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:33,100
You're not a pig, but you're ugly.

312
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:35,000
I'm not a pig?

313
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,800
Pigs lose weight.

314
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,700
You can't help it if you're ugly.

315
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:42,000
If you say that...

316
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,400
Why do you say that?

317
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,000
You're dirty.

318
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,600
You're dirty.

319
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,900
You're a coward.

320
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:55,300
You have the same opinion as me.

321
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:59,200
But you're a high school student on TV.

322
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:02,200
You don't have an idol idea.

323
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:05,900
You're like Mayuzuki Hikaru.

324
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,300
Who's that?

325
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:08,800
You're like Mayuzuki Hikaru.

326
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:12,200
Who's Mayuzuki Hikaru?

327
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:15,000
You look like him.

328
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,700
You look like him.

329
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:21,400
How many years ago was that?

330
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:24,800
I haven't had a girlfriend recently.

331
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:28,000
I haven't had a girlfriend for five years.

332
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,500
You said you haven't had a girlfriend.

333
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:33,500
I'm...

334
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:36,500
I'm not a bad guy like Kato.

335
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,600
I'm not a bad guy like Kato.

336
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:42,900
I haven't forgotten.

337
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:46,600
When I was in elementary school...

338
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,200
Don't say that!

339
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,200
You haven't forgotten.

340
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:53,200
When I was in fifth grade...

341
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:57,200
I haven't forgotten.

342
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,800
That was terrible.

343
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:05,300
I had a toothache from the morning.

344
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:08,000
I didn't go to school.

345
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,400
No one was home.

346
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,600
I was the only one.

347
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,400
I had a toothache at home.

348
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,700
I didn't want to do anything.

349
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,200
I didn't want to eat anything.

350
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:20,600
I just stayed at home.

351
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:26,000
Then the lady next to me said...

352
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Mr. Matsuo!

353
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,300
Your dog is running away!

354
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:35,500
Ouch!

355
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,800
She came out and chased me.

356
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,100
She thought I was playing with her, so she ran away.

357
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:44,100
She was happy to see me.

358
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:46,100
She was like this.

359
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:48,600
My teeth hurt, but she ran away.

360
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,800
My dog is big.

361
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,300
It's big, isn't it?

362
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:55,900
I couldn't catch her while I was doing a head lock.

363
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,900
She was like this all the time.

364
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:00,100
She didn't smell at all.

365
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:01,600
She didn't smell at all.

366
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,200
She didn't smell at all.

367
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,100
She ran away.

368
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:11,400
When I looked at her, the chain was cut off.

369
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,200
I took her to the front yard.

370
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:17,200
I took her to the front yard.

371
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,700
I took her to the front yard.

372
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:24,300
I could hear a ringing sound.

373
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:25,200
I thought about it.

374
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,700
I had an important phone call.

375
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:28,500
I thought about it.

376
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,200
I thought it was a phone call.

377
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:33,300
The door was locked.

378
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:34,600
The door was locked.

379
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,400
Yes, because it was the front yard.

380
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,600
The door was locked.

381
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,800
I thought I had to get closer.

382
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,600
My teeth hurt, but I ran away.

383
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,000
I was like this.

384
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,400
I was like this.

385
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,600
I came back to the front yard.

386
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:49,400
I came back to the front yard.

387
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,600
The chain was cut off.

388
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:57,800
I was like this.

389
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:01,500
It's a complicated story, isn't it?

390
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:04,100
It's a complicated story, isn't it?

391
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:06,700
It's a complicated story, isn't it?

392
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:08,700
It's a complicated story, isn't it?

393
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,400
It's a complicated story, isn't it?

394
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,700
It's because you didn't go to buy ramen.

395
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,400
Hitoshi, bring the ramen here.

396
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,700
I don't know where to go.

397
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:25,600
Hello.

398
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:32,800
I just remembered the dance.

399
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:35,900
Are you coming with your friends today?

400
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:37,400
No, I'm not.

401
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,400
What are you doing?

402
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,400
No, I'm not.

403
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,900
You can't dance at all.

404
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:44,300
Let me introduce her.

405
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:47,900
She's from Chiba Prefecture.

406
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:49,100
Do you go to college?

407
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:50,900
No, I don't go to college.

408
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:51,900
What are you doing now?

409
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,000
I'm a freelance part-timer.

410
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:53,700
You're a pig?

411
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,500
Yes, that's right.

412
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,000
You're a part-timer, aren't you?

413
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:57,700
Yes, I am.

414
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:58,900
What do you do?

415
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:01,700
I run a water business.

416
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:02,900
Is that so?

417
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:06,500
You're so good at talking.

418
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,700
Do you go to a club?

419
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,200
Yes, I do.

420
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,700
What are you talking about?

421
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,900
What are you talking about?

422
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:14,600
I'm sorry.

423
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,800
Stop it.

424
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,300
I'm sorry.

425
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:22,500
Don't apologize to me.

426
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:26,800
Did you get any expensive gifts for your customers?

427
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,900
No, I didn't.

428
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:30,700
You didn't.

429
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:33,900
I'm sorry.

430
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:34,600
Is that so?

431
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:39,900
What is this?

432
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,400
What a strange girl.

433
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:45,200
I'm sorry.

434
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,500
Thank you.

435
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:50,900
Goodbye.

436
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:52,100
Please go home.

437
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:53,600
Wait a minute.

438
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,100
What is this?

439
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,100
Can I leave this here?

440
00:19:56,100 --> 00:20:04,200
Yes, you can.

441
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:07,600
Why did you turn your back on me when I was leaving?

442
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,100
What is this?

443
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:12,100
I don't understand.

444
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:14,000
Let me introduce this person.

445
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,800
Her pen name is Teruko Haruko.

446
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,400
Her pen name is Parman 1 and Parman 3.

447
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:23,400
Parman 2 is missing.

448
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:26,600
I'm going to pick him up.

449
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:34,200
Parman 4 is the manager of Nozanago.

450
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:37,900
I'm going to pick him up.

451
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,800
Please take good care of him.

452
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,500
I'm taking care of him now.

453
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,200
Yes, you are.

454
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,100
I heard that Parman 2 is walking on the street recently.

455
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:48,900
He looks tired.

456
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:52,800
He looks like a middle school student.

457
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:55,400
He looks like a middle school student.

458
00:20:55,400 --> 00:21:02,100
If you see Parman 2 in the street, please talk to him.

459
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:05,100
He looks like a middle school student.

460
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:07,400
We promise you.

461
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:13,100
If you see him, please talk to him.

462
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:17,500
If you don't talk to him, please contact us.

463
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:23,000
If you don't talk to him, please contact us.

464
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:28,100
This program is for the audience.

465
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:30,200
We have to do this.

466
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:33,800
We apologize to you.

467
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:36,500
Yes, we do.

468
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:40,500
This is the first time to bring a child here.

469
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:45,000
There are four people in the family.

470
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,500
I'm a little in the way.

471
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:49,500
Hello.

472
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,500
Good evening.

473
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:53,300
I have something to tell you.

474
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:56,500
As we promised on the program...

475
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,800
Stop it!

476
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:01,200
As we promised,

477
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,600
if you see Parman 2,

478
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,000
please tell him that you see Parman 2.

479
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,700
He will say in a loud voice,

480
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:13,700
I don't care who you bring.

481
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:15,700
I don't care who you bring.

482
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:19,900
I don't care who you bring.

483
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:23,900
If you see Parman 2, please tell him that you see Parman 2.

484
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:26,900
If you don't tell him, we will contact you.

485
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:31,100
If you don't tell him, we will contact you.

486
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,900
We are waiting for you.

487
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:34,400
What should we do?

488
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,100
What should we do?

489
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:37,200
I don't know.

490
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,800
Let's think of a punishment.

491
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,900
I don't think of a punishment.

492
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:45,900
This is a punishment only for Parman 2.

493
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:49,900
We will punish him so that he won't lose to the punishment game.

494
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:53,900
If we play the punishment game, Parman 2 will be in a good mood.

495
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:57,400
We will play the punishment game, but we won't play the punishment game.

496
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:00,900
This is the most effective punishment.

497
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:02,900
Really.

498
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:07,400
We are looking for an assistant.

499
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:13,400
Please send us a letter with the same address as Parman 2.

500
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,400
Please send us a letter.

501
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,900
Please send us a letter.

502
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:21,400
Please send us a letter.

503
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,400
Please.

504
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:46,400
