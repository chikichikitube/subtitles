1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
A new year's party will be held.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:08,000
The 11th Gaki no Tsukaiwaraen Chikichiki Millenium New Year's Party!

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Alright! Alright!

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm Yamazaki, who broke up with Dancing Yamachan last year.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Nice to meet you!

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Alright!

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Do you want to see Dancing Baby?

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Ah!

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Can you do it?

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Otsunomutsu and...

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Usoendekisoba!

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Today, I want to make it rain!

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Thank you!

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Thank you!

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
And...

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Obachan!

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
First of all, I'd like to hear a greeting from the angel of Harleys, Producer Suga.

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Nice to meet you!

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm really looking forward to this year as well.

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
This year as well?

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Everyone, please have fun!

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm looking forward to it!

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Thank you!

24
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
And now, the main character of this program!

25
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
The character?

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
The downtown person!

27
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Please say hello and look in the mirror!

28
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Thank you!

29
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Thank you!

30
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Thank you!

31
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Thank you!

32
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I'd like to work hard as Kotori as well.

33
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Today, Hamada-kun's...

34
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
There's also Kurotabushi.

35
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Eh? Are you going to show that?

36
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
That's the main character.

37
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I've been training him since two months ago.

38
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I'll do the spear myself.

39
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
And now, please look in the mirror!

40
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Ah, that's right!

41
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Yes!

42
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
And now...

43
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Please look in the mirror!

44
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
What is this?

45
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I'm sorry.

46
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
How do I say this?

47
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Just look in the mirror!

48
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:16,000
One, two, three!

49
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
This program is brought to you by these sponsors.

50
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
This year's Gaki no Tsukai is starting again.

51
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Everyone is excited to eat and chat.

52
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
But in the midst of this, Matsumoto has started to show an unusual tension.

53
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Please say quit!

54
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Quit!

55
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Quit!

56
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Don't quit!

57
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Don't quit!

58
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Don't quit!

59
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Don't quit!

60
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Don't quit!

61
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Matsumoto-san, please quit!

62
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Don't quit!

63
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
The second round! The third round!

64
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Yes, yes, yes!

65
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
You're going to die!

66
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
You're going to die!

67
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
You're going to die!

68
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
You're going to die!

69
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Ah!

70
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Matsumoto-san, the next round!

71
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
The next round!

72
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Next, the wine!

73
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
You can't drink it when it's hot!

74
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
It's okay, it's okay!

75
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I told you!

76
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Is your body okay?

77
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
It's definitely going to be bad!

78
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
It's okay, it's okay!

79
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
It's the first time I've seen you drink like this.

80
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
It's the first time I've seen him drink like this.

81
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
It's okay, it's okay!

82
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I quit!

83
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
It's really bad!

84
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
It's definitely going to be bad!

85
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Then, Hamada-san too!

86
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
It's hot!

87
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
It's okay, it's okay!

88
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Why are you doing this?

89
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
The wine is for Matsumoto, isn't it?

90
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Just in case.

91
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Drink the hot wine before the wine.

92
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I'll make you a sandwich.

93
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
There's milk in it.

94
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
It's like cheese.

95
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I quit!

96
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
You're going to die!

97
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
You're going to die!

98
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
You're going to die!

99
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
You're going to die!

100
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
You're going to die!

101
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I'm drinking a little bit of alcohol.

102
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
It's okay, it's okay!

103
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
It's okay, it's okay!

104
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
It's okay, it's okay!

105
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
It's okay, it's okay!

106
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
It's okay, it's okay!

107
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
It's really bad!

108
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
It's okay, it's okay!

109
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
It's okay, it's okay!

110
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
It's okay, it's okay!

111
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I quit!

112
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I don't care!

113
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
It's okay!

114
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Are you serious?

115
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
He's a crazy person.

116
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:20,760
He's like a

117
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:26,760
I've never seen anyone like this before.

118
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:33,760
I've never seen anyone like this before.

119
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:36,760
His face is all red.

120
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:39,760
The third time, we're going to make you laugh.

121
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:46,760
Millenium Manzai

122
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:51,760
This time, out of 25 people, I'd like you to choose 5 groups.

123
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:10,760
First of all, I'd like to choose the first group of people.

124
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,760
