1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The next day

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Hey, Masato-kun

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Yes, yes

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
You're outside today as well

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
That's right

6
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Do you know where we are?

7
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
What is it?

8
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
This is

9
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Look at this

10
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
This is where the Tamagotchi is

11
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
You can't go there

12
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Japanese people don't have this kind of respect

13
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'll teach you

14
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Let's go to the hall today

15
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Let's do it!

16
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Just for the time being

17
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
We're in Mitaka right now

18
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
We're in Mitaka

19
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
This is

20
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
There are quite a few famous people

21
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Oh really?

22
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Yes, they're alive

23
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
They're alive?

24
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
No, they're dead

25
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Look

26
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
The grave of Dazai Osamu

27
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Oh, there's something like this

28
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
This old man

29
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
This Tamagotchi

30
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
He committed suicide in this area

31
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
This is Moriogai

32
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
This is Moriogai

33
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Moriogai is that

34
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
The one who looks like he's going to die

35
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
That's right

36
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
That's right

37
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Ah

38
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Three people died in a car accident

39
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Three people

40
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
In a car

41
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
This is

42
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
When the car is running

43
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
If we go out and get pulled

44
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
There will be four people here

45
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
There will be

46
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'll make it a grave right away

47
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'll make it four people right away

48
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I like to do various things

49
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I've never been here

50
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
But it's okay

51
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
No, that's what the soldiers say

52
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The soldiers are walking

53
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I couldn't accept it

54
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
But it's okay

55
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I've never been here

56
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Today is quite

57
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
This beautiful

58
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Musashi's

59
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
In the entertainment theater

60
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
In downtown Gaki Natsukai

61
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I'm asking for your opinion

62
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
That's right

63
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Then

64
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I'll do my best

65
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Then I'll go

66
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Boo

67
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Boo

68
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Today

69
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Today

70
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Yes

71
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I'll do it this time

72
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
That's right

73
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I said it last week

74
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
That's right

75
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
That's right

76
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I'll do it

77
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I have to say that too

78
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Yeah

79
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
What kind of content

80
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Let's use the body

81
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I don't use my body much

82
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
This program

83
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Because it's a mouth

84
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Because it's a mouth

85
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
So use your body

86
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Try it

87
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Where are you going

88
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Where are you going

89
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:55,000
When you're done

90
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Something is noisy

91
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Kirara

92
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Kirara

93
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
What

94
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Today is the final

95
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
That's right

96
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I'll do my best

97
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Let's do our best

98
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Boo

99
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
We've come this far

100
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
That's right

101
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
This year was particularly difficult

102
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
In the previous tournament

103
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
That's right

104
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
If you think of it

105
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
It was a tough fight

106
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
The first round was certainly

107
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Obonko Obonko

108
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
That's right

109
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I was defeated by that attack

110
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I don't have any meaning

111
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I stepped out

112
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
That's right

113
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I was defeated by that

114
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Then next

115
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
What is that

116
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
The University of Ethiopia

117
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Hopeco Pisco

118
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I was defeated by that attack too

119
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
We were also defeated by that rubber attack

120
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
That's right

121
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Today is the final

122
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
That's right

123
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I can't lose

124
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Who is today's opponent

125
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Today

126
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Uchanko Nanchanko

127
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
The most

128
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
The most

129
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I can't lose to such dirty guys

130
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I'll do my best

131
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I understand

132
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Your face is a little scary

133
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Are you okay

134
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
What

135
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Your face is scary

136
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
But they are also poor

137
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
That's right

138
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
There is no way we can win

139
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
That's right

140
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Your serve is the best in this fight

141
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
That's right

142
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
It's noisy

143
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I can't concentrate

144
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I'll do my best

145
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Then let's go

146
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
It's a serve from the other side

147
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
It's coming

148
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Don't finish it now

149
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I did it

150
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I finished it

151
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Idiot

152
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
What are you doing

153
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
You are hiding things from me

154
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
What are you talking about

155
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I just said it

156
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I said it

157
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
But you are hiding things from me

158
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
What are you talking about

159
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I thought you were slow

160
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
On that day

161
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Don't do it here

162
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
You are here

163
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I told you to apply a lot of blood

164
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
You also did it during the fight

165
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
It's 5 minutes

166
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I can't lose

167
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
The next serve is from the other side

168
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Don't get angry

169
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
It's our serve

170
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
It's our serve

171
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
It's my serve

172
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
That's right

173
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I haven't done this for a long time

174
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I'll do my best

175
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Take it

176
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I'll do it

177
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
What are you doing

178
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Your serve is a bad joko serve

179
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
A bad joko serve

180
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
It's your serve

181
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I'll do my best

182
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I'll do it

183
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I'll do it

184
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
What are you doing

185
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I'm sorry

186
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Please take it

187
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Please take it

188
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I'll do it

189
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
What are you doing

190
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
What are you doing

191
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
It's my serve

192
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
That's right

193
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Please take it

194
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I got it

195
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:18,000
It's a bad joko serve

196
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
It's your serve

197
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Please do your best

198
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I got it

199
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I'll do my best

200
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I'll do it

201
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
It's a bad joko serve

202
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
It was a bit traditional

203
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Even so, I'll take it

204
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
It's okay

205
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Hirara

206
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
What

207
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
At this rate, we might lose

208
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Oh my

209
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
What are you saying

210
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
It's okay

211
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
We have to use that

212
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Are you talking about that?

213
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
That's right

214
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
No, that's too dangerous

215
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
It's okay

216
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Do you want to do it?

217
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I'll do it

218
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
It's a bad joko serve

219
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Combine

220
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,220
Let's combine!

221
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:04,920
Okay I will!

222
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,200
Okay I will!

223
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:08,660
I'll go!

224
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:24,380
The weak point of this, is that you lose always,

225
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,760
Aaaaahh! If you keep it that way you lose.

226
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,240
I have no choice but to attack then!

227
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,760
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

228
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:34,120
Is that you, by any chance...?

229
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:34,820
You mean that one?

230
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:36,120
Yes!

231
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,120
That's no good!

232
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:41,220
But, if we do that one, those kids might die!

233
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:41,980
It's fine if they die!

234
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:43,680
No good!

235
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,880
We will win!

236
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:48,080
It'll be killing people! Let's stop it!

237
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:48,760
Alright!

238
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,760
We're going to do it!

239
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:51,940
If you say we're doing it...

240
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:52,800
We'll unite!

241
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,720
Alright!

242
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:57,760
Huna, huna, huna, huna, huna, huna, huna, huna, kii!

243
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,420
Now, then, if you can sell it, sell it!

244
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,040
Thin girl's receipt!

245
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:05,120
Hang on now

246
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:06,720
That's not Could!

247
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:09,180
You said just Countple!

248
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,640
Please erase this

249
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:31,640
That's not cool at all. What the hell is that?

250
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:34,640
Stop it!

251
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,640
It's been a long time since I've done this.

252
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:45,640
I'll do it while remembering.

253
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:55,640
Come on, do it!

254
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,640
We don't have time to waste.

255
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,640
Let's just go with it.

256
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,640
Hey, yesterday...

257
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,640
What is it?

258
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:06,640
I really like Katsura.

259
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:10,640
Yesterday, there was a radio show in Osaka.

260
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,640
You went back to Osaka, right?

261
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,640
I hurried back, right?

262
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:19,640
At the station in Shin-Osaka, there was a guy with a bad attitude.

263
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,640
Two guys with a bad attitude followed me.

264
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,640
Yankees, right?

265
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,640
Yankees, Yankees, Yankees.

266
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:26,640
Rather than a Yankee, there was another guy in a higher class.

267
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,640
He was a gangster, right?

268
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,640
That's right.

269
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,640
They followed me.

270
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,640
There was a guy in a taxi.

271
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,640
He was so heavy.

272
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,640
Hey, hey.

273
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,640
Don't pretend to be nice.

274
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,640
I'm not.

275
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,640
I'm not pretending to be nice.

276
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:46,640
I'm really bad at pretending to be nice, right?

277
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,640
Yankees.

278
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:50,640
I'm not pretending to be nice right now.

279
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,640
I don't usually pretend to be like this.

280
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,640
I don't know if it's true or not.

281
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,640
That's why I can't say that I'm bad at pretending to be nice.

282
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,640
On TV, they say,

283
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,640
Fuyumann is a good-looking guy.

284
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,640
I'm not good-looking.

285
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,640
I've never pretended to be good-looking.

286
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,640
Is there anything else you want to say?

287
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,640
Well, you know...

288
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:08,640
If they say that, I'll say it too.

289
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,640
No, no.

290
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,640
What are you talking about?

291
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,640
What are you talking about?

292
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,640
Well, you know...

293
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,640
When I'm in this world,

294
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,640
I can't use the strength I'm proud of.

295
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:20,640
If I get into a fight or something...

296
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,640
What are you talking about?

297
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,640
What are you talking about?

298
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,640
No, no.

299
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,640
I'm strong.

300
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,640
I'm really strong.

301
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,640
Right?

302
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,640
When I was in high school, I had a band.

303
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,640
What are you talking about?

304
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,640
I was living my life with a band.

305
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,640
What do you mean with a band?

306
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:40,640
I was interested in young people, so I had a band.

307
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,640
That's what happened.

308
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,640
That's what happened.

309
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,640
Something scary happened.

310
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,640
But I couldn't help it.

311
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,640
I thought I could hit him.

312
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,640
When I went out in the morning,

313
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,640
I opened one door.

314
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,640
There was a hallway and an entrance door.

315
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:54,640
Yes, yes, yes.

316
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:58,640
I changed my clothes and opened the first door in the morning.

317
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,640
He came in like this.

318
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,640
What are you talking about?

319
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,640
He came in like this.

320
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,640
Inside the room?

321
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,640
Inside the room.

322
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,640
Just like this.

323
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:10,640
I asked him,

324
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,640
What are you talking about?

325
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,640
He said,

326
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,640
What are you talking about?

327
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,640
At that time,

328
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,640
we had a lot of fans on this program.

329
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,640
We were like that.

330
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,640
He said something like,

331
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,640
What are you talking about?

332
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,640
I chased him to the bottom.

333
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,640
I was scared.

334
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:28,640
In the end, I had to let go.

335
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,640
No, you're not.

336
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,640
I didn't do anything.

337
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,640
I went to the wall.

338
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,640
You didn't go?

339
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,640
What I was scared about was

340
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:38,640
I forgot to close the entrance door.

341
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,640
It's your fault.

342
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,640
It's my fault,

343
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,640
but when I woke up in the morning,

344
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:46,640
I was sitting like this next to the futon.

345
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,640
Were you looking at me?

346
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,640
I don't know.

347
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,640
You were like this.

348
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,640
I said,

349
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,640
What are you talking about?

350
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,640
He said,

351
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:58,640
I'm a fan.

352
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,640
This is...

353
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,640
You shouldn't do that.

354
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,640
This is...

355
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:07,640
I've never been so angry.

356
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,640
That's not true.

357
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,640
I feel sorry for you.

358
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,640
You've done a lot of things.

359
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,640
You've done a lot of things.

360
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:14,640
What?

361
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,640
When I came home,

362
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,640
mayonnaise was applied to the door.

363
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,640
That's what I thought.

364
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,640
Mayonnaise is applied to the door.

365
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,640
Why don't you know what mayonnaise is?

366
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,640
I was trying to make you jealous.

367
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:27,640
I was trying to make you jealous.

368
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:30,640
I brought a broom and wiped it like this.

369
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,640
It's beautiful.

370
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:33,640
You did a good thing.

371
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,640
The door was shiny.

372
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,640
I can't break it.

373
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,640
I'm glad I saw it on TV.

374
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:41,640
If I had wiped the door with mayonnaise, it would have been beautiful.

375
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:44,640
I can't paint it for a while.

376
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:47,640
Please bring me a postcard.

377
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,640
There are a lot of postcards this week.

378
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:53,640
It's like a radio show.

379
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,640
There are a lot of postcards this week.

380
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:58,640
I'm grateful.

381
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,640
Let me introduce you today.

382
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:04,640
There are many people who want to see the postcards.

383
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:08,640
I'm going to introduce you to those people.

384
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,640
What?

385
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,640
I was going to say that.

386
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:13,640
What?

387
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,640
I'm going to look at it.

388
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:19,640
I sometimes look at my partner's face.

389
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:26,640
I want it.

390
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,640
I want it.

391
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:32,640
This person's pen name is Chibi Maruko.

392
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:35,640
He has experience in UFOs.

393
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:40,640
What do you mean experience in UFOs?

394
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:45,640
I've told you many times that I've seen UFOs.

395
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:49,640
Do you think that experience will be trusted by everyone?

396
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:50,640
I think so.

397
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:53,640
You saw it and came to the station, didn't you?

398
00:13:53,640 --> 00:14:03,640
You saw it and came to the station, didn't you?

399
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:08,640
You saw it and came to the station, didn't you?

400
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,640
Who will trust you?

401
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:13,640
I told you this story before.

402
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:16,640
There are many UFO researchers in Japan.

403
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:20,640
There are many UFO researchers in Japan.

404
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:23,640
That person is going to do a UFO special.

405
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:26,640
Please come to the studio to talk about it.

406
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:29,640
It's a joke.

407
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:34,640
I don't know what a comedian can say.

408
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:37,640
I have a lot of things.

409
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,640
What is this?

410
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:43,640
This person is from Saitama Prefecture.

411
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,640
This person is from Saitama Prefecture.

412
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:50,640
Is Mach-chan a homo?

413
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,640
My friends say that Mach-chan is definitely a homo.

414
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:56,640
Even if Mach-chan is a homo, I will be a fan of Mach-chan for the rest of my life.

415
00:14:56,640 --> 00:15:01,640
That's right.

416
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:06,640
Am I a homo?

417
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:13,640
This is a homo.

418
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,640
I'm not a homo at all.

419
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,640
But there are times when I'm embarrassed.

420
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:20,640
For example, when I'm in a car.

421
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,640
A man is in the passenger seat.

422
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:26,640
I sometimes see a man putting his hand on the side brake.

423
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,640
I sometimes see a man putting his hand on the side brake.

424
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:35,640
I stop at the traffic light and pull the side brake.

425
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,640
That's true.

426
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:40,640
But it has nothing to do with being a homo.

427
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:43,640
I think it's a little embarrassing in my heart.

428
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:48,640
What about you?

429
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:52,640
After all, for a moment...

430
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,640
What is this hand?

431
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,640
I'm sorry.

432
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,640
Something like this.

433
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:01,640
Something like this.

434
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,640
You go to a bookstore, right?

435
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:06,640
There's something like a sub.

436
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,640
Like the Barazoku.

437
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:11,640
If there's a Barazoku while looking at a book like this,

438
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,640
There's something like that, right?

439
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:16,640
I'd like to see it a little.

440
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:19,640
Is this a homo?

441
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:22,640
But you can't see it all the time, can you?

442
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:28,640
Do you have to bring it all the way here and look at it like this?

443
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,640
Look at the A part.

444
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:31,640
Why?

445
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:34,640
Are you going to buy it?

446
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:38,640
When I went to a disco in Kyoto, there was one.

447
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:39,640
Really?

448
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:40,640
Invite me.

449
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,640
What did you say?

450
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,640
Come on.

451
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,640
Why are you so arrogant?

452
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,640
Come on.

453
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,640
What?

454
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,640
Come on, come on.

455
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,640
I'll take you to the bathroom.

456
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,640
I'll put you in the bathroom.

457
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:56,640
You're gone.

458
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,640
It's usually scary at that point.

459
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,640
If that man calls you to the bathroom.

460
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:04,640
It's either torn or killed.

461
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,640
Come on, come on.

462
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,640
I'll put you in the bathroom.

463
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:12,640
I'll take off my belt and do it.

464
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,640
It was really scary.

465
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,640
It was really scary.

466
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,640
What happened?

467
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,640
What?

468
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:21,640
Nothing at all.

469
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,640
At this point, it's all weird.

470
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,640
I'm already at the end of my clothes.

471
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:28,640
I ran away.

472
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,640
Really.

473
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,640
If you're going to Osaka, you should study in Osaka.

474
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,640
That's why I said goodbye.

475
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,640
That's right.

476
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,640
We don't have much time today.

477
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,640
That's right.

478
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,640
Let's go to Kyoto.

479
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,640
What?

480
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,640
What kind of thing do you have?

481
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,640
There's no end to it.

482
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,640
There's no end to it.

483
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,640
What is it?

484
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:42,640
Well,

485
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,640
Ketsukatto.

486
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,640
Ketsukatto, right?

487
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,640
Ketsukatto.

488
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:50,640
Everyone says this later.

489
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,640
It's not cool.

490
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,640
We're used to saying it.

491
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,640
Ketsukatto.

492
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,640
If you say this here,

493
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:59,640
Osaka people say, what kind of thing do you use?

494
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,640
What kind of thing do you use?

495
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,640
Ketsukatto.

496
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,640
If you say this here,

497
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:09,640
What are you doing?

498
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,640
What are you doing?

499
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,640
What are you doing?

500
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,640
What kind of usage is that?

501
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,640
What are you doing?

502
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,640
That's a good one.

503
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,640
What are you doing?

504
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,640
What are you doing?

505
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,640
What are you doing?

506
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,640
What are you doing?

507
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,640
That's what I'm saying.

508
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,640
What are you doing?

509
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,640
What are you doing?

510
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,640
What kind of thing does he do?

511
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,640
What kind of thing do you do?

512
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,640
Don't bite your butt.

513
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,640
Are you biting your butt?

514
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,640
Bite your butt.

515
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,640
Bite your butt.

516
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,640
It's hard.

517
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:49,640
What?

518
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:53,640
It's been a long time since I've been here.

519
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:56,640
What are you doing?

520
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,640
Ketsukatto.

521
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,640
What else?

522
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,640
What else?

523
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,640
What I was saying earlier.

524
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,640
When you're tired.

525
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,640
In Osaka dialect.

526
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,640
What do you say?

527
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,640
When you're tired?

528
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,640
Today.

529
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:08,640
Great.

530
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,640
Today was great.

531
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:14,640
Do you say it?

532
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,640
Do you say it?

533
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:18,640
Which one are you?

534
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,640
You don't say it?

535
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,640
You say it.

536
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,640
You don't say it.

537
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,640
The person who raised his hand is a local.

538
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:29,640
It's a country book.

539
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,640
Where are you from?

540
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,640
Gifu.

541
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,640
Gifu?

542
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,640
That's cool.

543
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:40,640
That's the worst.

544
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,640
Gifu?

545
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,640
I don't understand what you're saying.

546
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,640
That's right.

547
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:49,640
When you're tired, today was great.

548
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:50,640
Today's point.

549
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,640
Today's point.

550
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:55,640
For example, if this person does this.

551
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:58,640
It's ticklish.

552
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,640
It's ticklish.

553
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,640
Osaka dialect is different.

554
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:04,640
It's ticklish.

555
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,640
It's ticklish.

556
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,640
It's ticklish.

557
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,640
It's ticklish.

558
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,640
It's ticklish.

559
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,640
Don't make fun of me.

560
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,640
Don't say it.

561
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,640
It's ticklish.

562
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,640
This is today's point.

563
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,640
It's ticklish.

564
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,640
It's ticklish.

565
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,640
Don't make fun of me.

566
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,640
That's great.

567
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,640
That's great.

568
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,640
Where would you like to go today?

569
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,640
Kojubai.

570
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,640
Really?

571
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,640
Are you ready?

572
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,640
What else should we do?

573
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:38,640
The person next to me will make fun of the person next to me.

574
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,640
The person next to me...

575
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,600
If you make fun of me.

576
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:32,600
Goodbye.

577
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,640
You're not really cool.

578
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,600
We all are.

579
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,600
Let's do it.

580
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,600
Let's go.

581
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,600
You can just say,

582
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,600
Kocho kocho kocho!

583
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,600
If I say, yes,

584
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,600
Kocho kocho kocho!

585
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,600
Kocho kocho kocho!

586
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,600
Three times!

587
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,600
Kocho kocho kocho!

588
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:03,600
Next to you,

589
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,600
Ah, Kocho!

590
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,600
Do you understand?

591
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,600
Kocho kocho kocho!

592
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,600
Ah, Kocho!

593
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,600
Good bye, Konami!

594
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,600
That's the end.

595
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,600
Do you understand?

596
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,600
Yes.

597
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,600
Let's go!

598
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,600
Let's go!

599
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,600
Ah, one, two, three!

600
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,600
Yes!

601
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,600
That's the end!

602
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,600
But,

603
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,600
As soon as you say it,

604
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,600
You can't decide right away.

605
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,600
Well, well, well.

606
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,600
It doesn't matter if you're a soldier or not.

607
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,600
That's impossible.

608
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,600
Now, let's do the last one.

609
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,600
The last one.

610
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,600
Let's decide right away.

611
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,600
It's good to say goodbye.

612
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,600
Now, let's go!

613
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,600
One, two!

614
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,600
Ah, Kocho!

615
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,600
Ah, Kocho!

616
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,600
That's good!

617
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,600
That's good!

618
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,600
Now, let's go.

619
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,600
Let's learn how to say,

620
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,600
Tsuruttai, Hachobai.

621
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:55,600
That's all for today.

622
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,600
Goodbye, everyone.

623
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,600
Thank you very much.

624
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:05,600
Well,

625
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:06,600
Yes.

626
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:07,600
It's over.

627
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,600
It's over.

628
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,600
How was your first skit?

629
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:11,600
Ah, today?

630
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,600
Yes.

631
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,600
Ah,

632
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,600
I couldn't even sleep.

633
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,600
I couldn't even sleep.

634
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,600
I couldn't even sleep.

635
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,600
I couldn't even sleep.

636
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,600
Well,

637
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,600
It's been a while.

638
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,600
Yes.

639
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,600
Well,

640
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,600
That's all.

641
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,600
That's all.

642
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,600
That's right.

643
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,600
Yes.

644
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,600
The opening is no good.

645
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,600
That's strange.

646
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:29,600
What?

647
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,600
What do you mean?

648
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,600
It's already December.

649
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,600
That's strange.

650
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,600
It was cold today.

651
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,600
There's no way it's cold.

652
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,600
Yes.

653
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,600
That's strange.

654
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,600
I should have told you the day before yesterday.

655
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,600
That's right.

656
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,600
What do you think?

657
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,600
Well,

658
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,600
I don't know.

659
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,600
Well,

660
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,600
Next week is also a skit.

661
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,600
Yes.

662
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,600
Next week is also a skit.

663
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,600
Next week,

664
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:53,600
Well,

665
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,600
What do you mean?

666
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:55,600
Well,

667
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,600
It's a series of researchers.

668
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:57,600
I see.

669
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,600
Yes.

670
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,600
There's a thing called a researcher.

671
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,600
Yes.

672
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:01,600
It's like that.

673
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,600
Well,

674
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,600
I want everyone to study it.

675
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,600
That's right.

676
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,600
Yes.

677
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,600
I want you to think about the meaning.

678
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,600
Yes.

679
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,600
Yes.

680
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,600
That's right.

681
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,600
What do you mean?

682
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,600
It's beautiful.

683
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,600
It's beautiful, so it's good to be beautiful.

684
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,600
The dressing room is.

685
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,600
Yes.

686
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,600
Well,

687
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,600
It's not a place.

688
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:17,600
People's offerings are there.

689
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,600
Children are crying.

690
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,600
Yes.

691
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,600
Well,

692
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,600
It's getting blue here.

693
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,600
Yes.

694
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,600
The tension is getting lower.

695
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,600
Yes.

696
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:25,600
It's getting blue here.

697
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,600
Yes.

698
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:27,600
I've been there every day.

699
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,600
Yes.

700
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:29,600
I've been there every day.

701
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,600
Yes.

702
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,600
I'm talking about it now.

703
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:32,600
Yes.

704
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:33,600
I'm talking about it now.

705
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,600
Yes.

706
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,600
Well,

707
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,600
Well,

708
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,600
Thank you for your time.

709
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,600
We'll get in touch.

710
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,600
Good.

711
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,600
Yes.

712
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,600
I'm sure it'll be okay.

713
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,600
Thank you.

714
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:56,600
This program was brought to you by Oyama International Products, Sunlux, and Toyosui.
