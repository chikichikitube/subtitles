1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Can the Bibi scare people?

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Today's guest is the world's best ghost!

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
It's been a while since we've seen you.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I've been on this show for 10 years now, but I have a bad feeling about this.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
What is it?

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
It's been a while since I've seen you, and you're the worst opening.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
It smells like poop.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Was it bad to have a Heipo opening in the past?

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm sure the viewers have a good feeling about this.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
It's been a while since I've seen you, and you're the worst opening.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I didn't participate in the show at all today.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'll just say this.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Today's guest is the world's best Heipo!

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Why are you dressed like this?

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I don't have an aura at all.

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I don't have an aura at all.

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I think I should cut this and make it into Tsuki-yaki.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Tsuki-yaki?

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I think we should all eat Harami.

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
This one?

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
This program is brought to you by these sponsors.

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
First of all, let's see how scared Heipo is.

23
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Apparently, Heipo has gone to a scary place.

24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I was really scared.

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm sure it's Harami.

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I didn't think it was Harami.

27
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
The world's best Heipo.

28
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
This man, who has made many mistakes as a scary man,

29
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
is going to challenge an even scarier legend tonight.

30
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
The world's best Heipo, a scary experience report.

31
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Good evening, I'm Saito.

32
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I'm now at the famous Sendagaya Tunnel, a ghost spot in Tokyo.

33
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
The best ghost spot in Tokyo, the Sendagaya Tunnel.

34
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:15,000
It's a ghost tunnel where ghosts are said to have been awakened by moving the grave to open it.

35
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
It's a very scary place, so I'd like to experience it right away.

36
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I'm going.

37
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Why is it so creepy here?

38
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
There's something like a rake over there.

39
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I can hear a woman's cry.

40
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I'm scared of this picture.

41
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Huh?

42
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
The staff who was supposed to be there...

43
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Why?

44
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Take it off.

45
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Take it off.

46
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I was surprised.

47
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
What is this?

48
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
The next destination is Hachioji, which has many ghost spots.

49
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
It's now turned into a ruins without a trace of people.

50
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
But this is a little scary.

51
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
In the back of the suspicious Zoukibayashi,

52
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
there is a headless statue of the dead.

53
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Good evening, I'm Saito.

54
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I'm going.

55
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I'm really going.

56
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I'm scared.

57
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I'm scared.

58
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
What, what, what?

59
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I'm scared.

60
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Come with me.

61
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I'm scared, I'm scared.

62
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
It's pitch black.

63
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
It's really creepy.

64
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:41,000
It's really creepy.

65
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
It's cold.

66
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Actually, I was told by the manager.

67
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
It's cold.

68
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
When you get a cold,

69
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
tighten your butt and say,

70
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Hey, hey, hey.

71
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
It's good to do it.

72
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
What, what, what?

73
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Let's go.

74
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
It's really close.

75
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Where do I put my luggage?

76
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I was surprised.

77
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
What is it?

78
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
No, no, no, no.

79
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I'm scared, I'm scared, I'm scared.

80
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I'm scared.

81
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Are you crazy?

82
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I heard a sound there.

83
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Let's stop it.

84
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
It's the entrance.

85
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
It's true.

86
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
It's not the entrance.

87
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
It's not the entrance.

88
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Look, look, something fell.

89
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Stop it.

90
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I don't like it anymore.

91
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
What?

92
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
What is that person?

93
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I don't like it.

94
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Let's go home.

95
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Let's go home.

96
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I've never done anything like this before.

97
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I'm sorry, please give up.

98
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I'm really scared.

99
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Please.

100
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Let's go home.

101
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Let's go home.

102
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Stop it.

103
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Good evening, I'm Saito.

104
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I'm at the haunted house in Fuji-Q Highland.

105
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I'm at the haunted house in Fuji-Q Highland.

106
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I'm at the haunted house in Fuji-Q Highland.

107
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
The haunted house in Fuji-Q Highland.

108
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
The haunted house in Fuji-Q Highland.

109
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
It's a haunted house with the image of the abandoned hospital.

110
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
It's a haunted house with the image of the abandoned hospital.

111
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
This is the most terrible haunted house in Fuji-Q.

112
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Let's go.

113
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Do you know where the ghost is?

114
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
That's right.

115
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I can smell the ghost from inside the hospital.

116
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
It's scary.

117
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
It's so hard.

118
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
It's so hard.

119
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
It's so hard.

120
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
What are you doing?

121
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:08,000
It's so hard.

122
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
What?

123
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
It's so hard.

124
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
It's so hard.

125
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
It's so hard.

126
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
It's so hard.

127
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
It's so hard.

128
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
It's so hard.

129
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
It's so hard.

130
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
It's too hard.

131
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
It's already hard enough.

132
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Please, I beg you. I have a heartache.

133
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
He's giving up.

134
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
He's in the hospital.

135
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
He's not giving up yet.

136
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I have a heartache.

137
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
That's how scared he is.

138
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I wonder if he can scare people.

139
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I'm confident about that.

140
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I'm good at scaring people.

141
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
He knows what he's scared of.

142
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
He knows what he's scared of.

143
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
That's right.

144
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
M is the most S.

145
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
He knows.

146
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
That's right.

147
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
It's M, right?

148
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Yes, it's very M.

149
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
The first ghost is Yatsuhakamura Heipo.

150
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
The first ghost is Heipo.

151
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Is Yatsuhakamura scared of the guests?

152
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
He's here.

153
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
He's here.

154
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I can't wear glasses.

155
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
But he's a little scared.

156
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
That's right.

157
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
What is it?

158
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Heipo.

159
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Yes.

160
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Vibrate properly.

161
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Yes.

162
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I'll do it properly.

163
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
He looks like Tanaka.

164
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
He looks like Tanaka.

165
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
He looks like Tanaka.

166
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
He looks like Tanaka.

167
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
He looks like Tanaka.

168
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
He looks like Tanaka.

169
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
He looks like Tanaka.

170
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
He looks like Tanaka.

171
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
He's here.

172
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
He's here.

173
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
He's a professional.

174
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
He looks like Tanaka.

175
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
He looks like Tanaka.

176
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
He looks like Tanaka.

177
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
He's scared of the girls.

178
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
He's here.

179
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
He doesn't notice.

180
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
He doesn't notice.

181
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
He's laughing.

182
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Yatsuhakamura.

183
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
What is it?

184
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Yatsuhakamura.

185
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
It's like the title of a movie.

186
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
He's here to make a video.

187
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
It's no good.

188
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
It's no good.

189
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
It's not scary.

190
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
He doesn't say it himself.

191
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
He's scared.

192
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
It's a little different.

193
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
He's wearing glasses.

194
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
He's wearing glasses.

195
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
He's small.

196
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
If he says that, it won't start.

197
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Next is Heipou the mouse man.

198
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
He's here.

199
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
He's here.

200
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
This is...

201
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Is it okay to look at it from the front like this?

202
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Is it okay to look at it from the front like this?

203
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Is it okay to look at it from the front like this?

204
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
This is good.

205
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
When I saw it when I was doing it earlier, the degree of perfection was low.

206
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
This is a child.

207
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
This is a child.

208
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
This is a child.

209
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
This is definitely a child.

210
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
What kind of timing is this?

211
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,000
There is no scary thing if you remove this timing.

212
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
It's a mouse, isn't it?

213
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
It's a child.

214
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
It's a child.

215
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
He's saying bye bye.

216
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Why do you say that the mouse man is a child?

217
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I don't need to.

218
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I want you to be a Dracula.

219
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I'll be a Dracula.

220
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
What should I do?

221
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,000
If you don't become a Dracula, you'll be a mouse man.

222
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
You can be a mouse man.

223
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Mouse man.

224
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I'm getting goosebumps.

225
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Don't call me a mouse man.

226
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I've said it many times.

227
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Try to be a Dracula.

228
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I'm a Dracula.

229
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Please.

230
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Pretend to be a frog.

231
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
What's wrong with you?

232
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
You sound like a mouse man.

233
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Next is Heipo Dracula.

234
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
But he changes his strategy here.

235
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:00,000
He sends that old lady as a guest and surprises Heipo.

236
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
This is the target of this time.

237
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Please turn around.

238
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
He doesn't talk.

239
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:27,000
He doesn't talk at all.

240
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I was surprised.

241
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:38,000
It was as I expected.

242
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I'll never do this again.

243
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I'm a mouse man.

244
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Is that so?

245
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I'm sorry.

246
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I don't think I'll ever come out again.

247
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
It's a long time ago.

248
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Really?

249
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I wanted to explain it to you.

250
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I understand.

251
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Don't fall in love with me.

252
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Hamada's ear hair.

253
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:32,000
The wind is blowing.

254
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
It was short.

255
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
The opening was short.

256
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
It was short, but it was long.

257
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
It's long.

258
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I don't know why the audience is sinking.

259
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
What's wrong with you?

260
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
What's wrong with me?

261
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
You don't want to talk.

262
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,000
You know that long hair?

263
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Yes.

264
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
You broke your arm.

265
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
You're on a bike and you're on your way to work.

266
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
That's not good.

267
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,000
If you think about breaking your arm, you can't do anything.

268
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I can't do anything.

269
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
You can't do anything.

270
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
It depends on where you broke it.

271
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
You two are still on the bike.

272
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I'm sorry.

273
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
It's fixed, so you can take it off.

274
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
But I can't do that. It hurts.

275
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Even if you poop, it's like a toilet seat.

276
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
It's okay.

277
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
If you grab it, it'll be okay.

278
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I don't care about that.

279
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:42,000
That's why I'm trying to attack Yoshimoto today.

280
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
That's why I'm telling you to send it.

281
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
It's a toilet seat.

282
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Even if I'm not bad, if a car comes from the other side and hits me, I'll be out of work today.

283
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,000
That's why I'm bothering you.

284
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
What's wrong with you?

285
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
What's wrong with me?

286
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Is it because of the button?

287
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
That's not funny.

288
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
You can't laugh at anything.

289
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Of course, the office will lend us an apartment.

290
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
They'll lend it to us.

291
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Really?

292
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
That's right.

293
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
It's like an idol, right?

294
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Well, we're like idols.

295
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
That's what I think.

296
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:32,000
It's a middle-class idol.

297
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
He won seven gold medals in the Olympics seven times in a row.

298
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Mr. Matsumoto, who has won the title of King of Olympics.

299
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
That's right.

300
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Please tell me how to avoid doping after a competition.

301
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
That's okay.

302
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
What?

303
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
That's a urine test or a blood test.

304
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
That's right.

305
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
There's no way you can't get caught.

306
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
There is.

307
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
If you get caught, it's over.

308
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
There is.

309
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
There is.

310
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Please tell me.

311
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Then I'll try to get it.

312
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I'll try to get the urine.

313
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Are you a prosecutor?

314
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I'm a detective.

315
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
My nose is high, so I don't care.

316
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Then...

317
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
That's okay.

318
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Then I'll take it out like this.

319
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
No, this.

320
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
What?

321
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
This.

322
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
No, no, no.

323
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
No, no.

324
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Please take this.

325
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Okay.

326
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
No, no.

327
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
No, no, no.

328
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
No, it's not okay.

329
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Don't take this.

330
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I can't do the test.

331
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Then...

332
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
No, no, no, no.

333
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Then I'll do it.

334
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Then I'll do it.

335
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
No, no, no, no.

336
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
No, no, no, no.

337
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
No, it's not drinking.

338
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
No, it's for a fool!

339
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Get it out here.

340
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Why!

341
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I don't want to get caught.

342
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
If you get caught, damn it!

343
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,000
You stand up, don't do that.

344
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
If you get caught...

345
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
You get caught!

346
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
No, no, no, no.

347
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
So I'll justify it.

348
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
No, no, no, no.

349
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
No, no, no, no.

350
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Are you stupid?

351
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Put your voice in here.

352
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I'm not letting you film me.

353
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
You're so stubborn.

354
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
That's fine.

355
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I don't think there's anyone who's as stubborn as you.

356
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
That's fine.

357
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I'll take this with me.

358
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
No, no, no.

359
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
What are you doing?

360
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Where are you going?

361
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Where are you going?

362
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
No, no, no.

363
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
You're stupid.

364
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
You're really stupid.

365
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
You shouldn't have had a check-up.

366
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
What are you doing?

367
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
It's a check-up.

368
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
It's a check-up for your eyes.

369
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
What?

370
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
You're stupid.

371
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
You don't understand that?

372
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
You shouldn't have had a check-up.

373
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
You shouldn't have had a check-up.

374
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
You're really stupid.

375
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
You're not qualified.

376
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
You're so stubborn.

377
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
You're so stubborn.

378
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
No, no, no.

379
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
You're stupid.

380
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
You're in a lab.

381
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
You're probably doing tests.

382
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
No, no, no.

383
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
What are you doing?

384
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I'm done.

385
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Run!

386
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I'm sure you are.

387
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I am confident to do it.

388
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
What do you mean confident?

389
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I am confident that I won't get caught.

390
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Even with blood test, I will be caught in the end.

391
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
What are you doing?

392
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
What are you doing?

393
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Don't do the test.

394
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I'm not asking you.

395
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I'm not asking you.

396
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I'm not asking you.

397
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I'm not asking you.

398
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
You can stab me.

399
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Don't do the test.

400
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
You can't stab me.

401
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
What are you doing?

402
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
I'm doing a check.

403
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
What are you doing?

404
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I'm doing a check.

405
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Then take it off.

406
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Why?

407
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
You can definitely do it.

408
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
If I can't do it, will everyone do it?

409
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
But you can't do it that far.

410
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
You don't have the guts.

411
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
If you stick to it, you'll think it's crazy and stop.

412
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
If you don't let me do it, I can't get out.

413
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
You can get out.

414
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Why? Before you do it.

415
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
There's a doping test before the game.

416
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
There's a doping test after the game.

417
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
No, no, no.

418
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
No, so even if there's no such thing.

419
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Even if you're a extremeENT, you can't get out of the play.

420
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
No, no.

421
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
You can't get out.

422
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I can't play.

423
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
No, no, no

424
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
No, no.

425
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I can't play.

426
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Please, can you pick up the flow.

427
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,500
No, no, no.

428
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,000
Oh, no, no.

429
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I can definitely do it.

430
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
He wouldn't do it.

431
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
K 뉴스

432
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
It's yours.

433
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,160
They go like U Paul

434
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,820
Gold medals like...

435
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:00,820
And they don't even realise

436
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,080
And the other ones go like

437
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,000
No no no no no...

438
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:05,720
Definitely

439
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,540
retarders

440
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:08,820
I don't want that

441
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:10,780
They stick to her

442
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:11,900
That makes no sense

443
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:12,840
And this goes for women too

444
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,720
They're alwaysnehmen

445
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,040
They can pull it off

446
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:16,760
Huh? How so?

447
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:17,800
How so?

448
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,840
When people say no

449
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:20,800
What do you do?

450
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:21,500
No no no no

451
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:22,160
Hey hey hey

452
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:23,020
Hey okay okay

453
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:23,580
Stop it

454
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:24,160
I'm gonna cuss

455
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,360
No, no, no

456
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,800
He means it

457
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,740
No, no, no

458
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:28,260
I said stop it

459
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:29,560
Please stop it

460
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,160
No, no, no

461
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:35,220
Are you absolutely gonna do it?

462
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:36,400
Are you gonna do it for sure?

463
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,420
You could fight a cancer or something.

464
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:44,700
I'm really sorry but it's cancer

465
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,900
I said what's cancer?

466
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,720
what's cancer?

467
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,840
so yes, it's cancer

468
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:50,640
what?

469
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,640
Nononono...

470
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,640
Nononono...

471
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,640
I'll show you.

472
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,640
Nononono...

473
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:02,640
I'll show you.

474
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,640
To the person in question.

475
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,640
He's a cute little guy who can keep his cuteness like Bambi.

476
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:15,640
In the news, a deer's horn was cut off with a saw.

477
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:18,640
What does a deer look like?

478
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,640
Please tell us how it feels to be a deer.

479
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,640
Ah, well...

480
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:27,640
I'm sure there are some people who have become deers.

481
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,640
Rebirth?

482
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,640
Well, there are some people who have been reborn as deers.

483
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,640
Among them?

484
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,640
Yes, there are.

485
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,640
Rebirth of a freezer.

486
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,640
I feel sorry for that kid.

487
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,640
A freezer?

488
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,640
Rebirth of a freezer.

489
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,640
A freezer!

490
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:52,640
I didn't do anything!

491
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,640
Rebirth of VHS nails.

492
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,640
There are a lot of them.

493
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:00,640
But I don't remember them.

494
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,640
You don't remember them, right?

495
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,640
I remember them.

496
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,640
What do you remember?

497
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,640
What I did.

498
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,640
I remember up to 50 of them.

499
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:10,640
What did you do one year before Matsumoto Hitoshi?

500
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,640
I was wearing a cover.

501
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:22,640
I thought you were wearing a cover here.

502
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,640
I was wearing a cover a long time ago!

503
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:28,640
To be honest, it was so funny.

504
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,640
I was so depressed.

505
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,640
I thought I was in the way.

506
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:36,640
I thought I was just making a fool of myself.

507
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,640
You became a human being from wearing a cover, right?

508
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,640
I did my best.

509
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:44,640
I didn't do much around my body.

510
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,640
The feelings of a deer.

511
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,640
The feelings of a deer.

512
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,640
Surprisingly, it's big.

513
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:54,640
It's a psychological pain.

514
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,640
Because at one point, it was like...

515
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:00,640
What are you doing?

516
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:01,640
What are you doing?

517
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,640
Are you crazy?

518
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,640
You can't do that!

519
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,640
You can't do that!

520
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:08,640
The shock at that time was a psychological pain.

521
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,640
Really?

522
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,640
I didn't know what I was doing.

523
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:14,640
But your friends did it too.

524
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,640
But wait.

525
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,640
When you were a deer,

526
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,640
your friend,

527
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:20,640
your friend who was so close to you,

528
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,640
was suppressed by an old man wearing work clothes.

529
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,640
He was like,

530
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:24,640
He was like,

531
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,640
He was like,

532
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:26,640
He was like,

533
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,640
He was like,

534
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:28,640
He was like,

535
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,640
He was like,

536
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,640
He was like,

537
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,640
He was like,

538
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:34,640
But, after you cut them off,

539
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,640
But, after you cut them off,

540
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,640
it'll get up again

541
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,640
and it'll be hurt.

542
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,640
Yes,

543
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,640
but it's the same as the line by the car.

544
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,640
You think,

545
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,640
What happened?

546
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,640
I'll wonder if it hurts.

547
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,640
Until the day before,

548
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,640
we were like,

549
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,640
We're friends.

550
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,640
He said,

551
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,640
He said,

552
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,640
He said,

553
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,640
He said,

554
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:56,640
He said,

555
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,640
He said,

556
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,640
I don't like you.

557
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:02,080
A little different

558
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,480
That Mo appeal was...

559
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,320
He said you must catch the ship by tomorrow

560
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,980
We went home, he fell asleep

561
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:13,460
And when he ask me to sleep I picked him up

562
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:18,080
I woke up and still hesitating

563
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,420
Earlier we had so much fun together

564
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:22,520
And then everyone holds me tight

565
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:24,800
But now they are kicked out

566
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:27,840
Something like that

567
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,840
No, no, I got it.

568
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:58,840
I can't see your face.
