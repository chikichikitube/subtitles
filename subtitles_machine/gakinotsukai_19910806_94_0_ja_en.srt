1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
You are doing well.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
And the young boy is coming.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
He's so handsome.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
He's so handsome.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
He's so handsome.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
He's so handsome.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
He's so handsome.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
You have to punish him.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Right?

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Today, I'm going to interview him.

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'm going to ask him about the TV station.

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I'm going to ask him about the TV station.

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
These two are going to be the main characters.

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
These two are going to be the main characters.

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Thank you.

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm going to interview him today.

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Taino coincidence.

18
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Taino coincidence.

19
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
We'll ask you about III Annihilating weeds on fireat.

20
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
We're going to interview Taichang.

21
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
We're going to interview Taichang.

22
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
We'll ask you about III Annihilating weeds on fireat.

23
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
We are watching the Amon gram.

We'll adjudiquing it from here.

25
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
We'll adjudiquing it from here.

26
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
We'll say.

27
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
How far are they now.

28
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'd like my staff to ask whether it's all OK.

29
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Let's go to the venue.

30
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Put the car in the right place!

31
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
You're the one who's being too much.

32
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm telling you to put it in the right place.

33
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Why?

34
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I'm surrounded by fans.

35
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I'm not a fan of Saito-san.

36
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm going to sing in the corner of the car.

37
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
You're singing in the corner?

38
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'll sing in the beginning.

39
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The song I'm listening to is...

40
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
the song is called,

41
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm going to use the word,

42
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm going to go to the C-Make in Japan.

43
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
What kind of woman is that?

44
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Don't make her이라고 싶어.

45
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
What was that?

46
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
That's what I said.

47
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,560
You can say what I said.

48
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,000
I'd be down if somebody asked me.

49
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I don't get like this sometimes.

50
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Don't say I gots you.

51
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Such a chatty guy.

52
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
He's pissed.

53
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
OK, let's go to the audio.

54
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I see your Chauffe.

55
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I'm working.

56
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I'm making money.

57
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I'm working.

58
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,000
If you have hands like me, you can earn as much as you want.

59
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Are you saying that?

60
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I have this.

61
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I have a different cup.

62
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Hey, everyone.

63
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
This is the only point.

64
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Let's stop it.

65
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Depending on the situation, we can think about it.

66
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I'm listening to this only.

67
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
She's wearing earphones.

68
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Our command will go here.

69
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
If you don't mind, we'll listen to you.

70
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Let's go.

71
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I'm looking forward to it.

72
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
What are you going to say?

73
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Are you a guillotin?

74
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Excuse me.

75
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Can you take a picture of me?

76
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I'm not a guillotin.

77
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
You want me to take a picture of you?

78
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Please take a picture of me.

79
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Please take a picture of me.

00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Please write it down.

81
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Please write down Aya-chan.

82
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Aya-chan's Aya.

83
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
That's the top.

84
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Please write down Aya-chan.

85
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Thank you very much.

86
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Excuse me.

87
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Can you take a picture of me?

88
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I'm not a guillotin.

89
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
You want me to take a picture of you?

90
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Please write it down.

91
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I'm not a guillotin.

92
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Let's go.

93
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Thank you very much.

94
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Please take a picture of me.

95
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:56,000
This program is brought to you by these sponsors.

96
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:02,000
When I was shopping, a high school student came to me and said,

97
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I went to a tea party with Sugawara of Ichiro Produce.

98
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I was asked to go home by the stove.

99
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Are you happy?

100
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I don't feel bad.

101
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Is that so?

102
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Excuse me.

103
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Can I ask you a private question?

104
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Do you have a girlfriend?

105
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I don't have a girlfriend at the moment.

106
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Do you have a girlfriend at the moment?

107
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I'd like to take a picture of you.

108
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Can you give her a cigarette?

109
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Can you give her a cigarette?

110
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Can you give her a cigarette?

111
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Can you give her a cigarette?

112
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Can you look to the left?

113
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Can you look to the left?

114
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Can you change your clothes?

115
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Can you change your clothes?

116
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Can you change your clothes?

117
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Can you change your clothes?

118
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Can you change your clothes?

119
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Can you change your clothes?

120
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Can you put on your helmet?

121
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Can you put on your helmet?

122
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Can you raise one foot on the chair?

123
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Can you do a pose of a beehive?

124
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Can you do a pose of a beehive?

125
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Can you do a pose of a beehive?

126
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Then, please stand up and do that.

127
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I can't do anything.

128
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Like this.

129
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Keep doing it, keep doing it.

130
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Please do that for a while.

131
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Then, please keep doing it for a while.

132
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
If you can do it like this.

133
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I can't do it.

134
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I can't do it.

135
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Okay.

136
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Go, go, go.

137
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I can't do it.

138
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I can't do it.

139
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Is it better to do it higher?

140
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Higher.

141
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
A little higher.

142
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Okay.

143
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
It's difficult.

144
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I can't do it.

145
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Go, go, go.

146
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Do it.

147
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Hey.

148
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,000
What are you doing?

149
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I can't do it.

150
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
You are.

151
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I won't say no. I'll do it all.

152
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I'm surprised.

153
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
You brought a banana.

154
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
You came all the way.

155
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I thought the last one would be a little strange.

156
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
But it's easy to start.

157
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Look at the camera.

158
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Ready, set, go!

159
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Don't get carried away.

160
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Ladies and gentlemen.

161
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Hello.

162
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Hello.

163
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Good morning.

164
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Good morning.

165
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I haven't slept much since yesterday.

166
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Why?

167
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I've been thinking about you.

168
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I'm happy.

169
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Tell me.

170
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Tell me what you thought of me.

171
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
This is also a kind of telling.

172
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
It's hot, isn't it?

173
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Isn't it especially hot this year?

174
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
It has nothing to do with the week.

175
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
It's really not hot this year.

176
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
It's hot.

177
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Was it this hot every year?

178
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Yes.

179
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Is the air conditioner on?

180
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
It's on.

181
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
What do you do when you're sleeping?

182
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I leave it on.

183
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
No!

184
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Why?

185
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:40,000
When I was in middle school, my family died.

186
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I slept with the air conditioner on.

187
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
It happened to me.

188
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
It happened to me.

189
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Why did two people die?

190
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
If there was one person, I would have died.

191
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
But my grandparents died together.

192
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
They were sleeping in the same room.

193
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I'm confident that I won't die even if the air conditioner is on.

194
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I won't die.

195
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I won't die even if I sleep in the electric room.

196
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
You shouldn't blame it on the air conditioner.

197
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
That's wrong.

198
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Is that so?

199
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
That's human life.

200
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
That's a coincidence.

201
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
There are people who die sleeping in a kotatsu.

202
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Even if it's dry.

203
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
There are!

204
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
There are people who die in a kotatsu.

205
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I don't believe it!

206
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I don't believe it either.

207
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I've never heard of it.

208
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
People who die in a kotatsu after they dry themselves.

209
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
That's right.

210
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Because they take all the water.

211
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
That's right.

212
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
If you have a thirst, you should drink something.

213
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,000
You don't have to stay in the kotatsu forever.

214
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
You can't stay in the kotatsu all the way.

215
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Is that how you do it?

216
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
That's how I do it.

217
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Is that how you do it?

218
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
That's wrong.

219
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
You don't even feel that you're thirsty.

220
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
What are you?

221
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Are you a housewife?

222
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
No, no, no.

223
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I'm talking.

224
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
You don't even feel that you're thirsty.

225
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
You feel like you're dreaming.

226
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I'm thirsty.

227
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I can't do this.

228
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
That's strange.

229
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
What are you going to do to celebrate your 100th birthday?

230
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I'm looking for something to do.

231
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I don't know if you can go, but you can go on a trip to the moon in a few years.

232
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Yes, the moon.

233
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
You've been there, haven't you?

234
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I haven't been there.

235
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Why not?

236
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I haven't been there.

237
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Why not?

238
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
It seems like a great place.

239
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
What's wrong?

240
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I'm scared to go on a plane.

241
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I want to go skiing.

242
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Are you scared to go on a plane?

243
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
No, I'm not.

244
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Aren't you scared?

245
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
No, I'm scared.

246
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
What are you talking about?

247
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
You're from Butohaya, so you're pretty scared.

248
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
It doesn't matter.

249
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I'm scared.

250
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
You're scared.

251
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
You're going to shake.

252
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
You're fine.

253
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
You're always shaking a little.

254
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
That's not what I expected.

255
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
When you're shaking, your face is so bright.

256
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
That's right.

257
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:24,000
When I'm scared, I act like I'm reading a book.

258
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
But when I'm shaking...

259
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I really don't know what to do.

260
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I really don't know what to do.

261
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
You know, when you're scared, bad things happen.

262
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I can't do anything.

263
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I'm really scared.

264
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I think I said this before.

265
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I was on a plane three or four years ago.

266
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I was on a plane on my way to Osaka.

267
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I was hungry, so I went to the studio.

268
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I was hungry, so I went to the studio.

269
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I brought food from the plane.

270
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I got on the plane and saw the screen.

271
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
It felt like New Year's.

272
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Happy New Year.

273
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Last year, I saw the news about the earthquake.

274
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I was on the news about the earthquake.

275
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:17,000
So I thought I'd ask you to make a video for me.

276
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I thought I'd ask you to make a video for me.

277
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I broke my leg.

278
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Please let me off the plane.

279
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I really wanted you to let me off the plane.

280
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I wanted you to let me off more than a boy I hated.

281
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Now Komashiro has gone.

282
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
He hasn't gone.

283
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
He hasn't gone.

284
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I'm going to make him go now.

285
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Really?

286
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Don't do that.

287
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Don't do that.

288
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
It's like this.

289
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I don't believe them.

290
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
When they go, they say,

291
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Welcome.

292
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I'm always thinking,

293
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Can I go back to that world?

294
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
You're thinking too much.

295
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Why do you think like that every day?

296
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
When I'm on the plane,

297
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I can't help it if I fall.

298
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
But I'm on the plane.

299
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
That can't be helped.

300
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
That's right.

301
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
If you get on the plane,

302
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Can I eat the candy on the plane?

303
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
When a kid says that, I can't help it.

304
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Do it after you get on the plane.

305
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
After I get on the plane?

306
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
You're here.

307
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Yes.

308
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Yes.

309
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Are you a general?

310
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
What are you doing now?

311
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I'm a student.

312
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
A student?

313
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
You're a student?

314
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
You're overdoing it at night.

315
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I'm not.

316
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I'm quiet.

317
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Quiet?

318
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:07,000
You're overdoing it.

319
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Do you have a boyfriend?

320
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Not now.

321
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Not now?

322
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
What do you mean?

323
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Did you break up?

324
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
When I was in kindergarten.

325
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
When you were in kindergarten?

326
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
That's funny.

327
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
You idiot.

328
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
That's amazing.

329
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Thank you very much.

330
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Thank you very much.

331
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
It's called boldness.

332
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Boldness.

333
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Good evening.

334
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I have something I want you two to talk about today.

335
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
It's a sardine.

336
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Everyone, let's get ready to laugh and listen.

337
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
So let's talk about this kind of theme.

338
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Is that okay?

339
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:59,000
The first person who finds it will be the name.

340
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I went to the deserted island.

341
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Who?

342
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Sribachi Yohei.

343
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
That was the end of Edo period.

344
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
There was a person called Sribachi Yohei in Edo period.

345
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I went to the deserted island.

346
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
That's right.

347
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:24,000
You can't go when it's cold like this.

348
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
What are you doing?

349
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I have a wallet like this.

350
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Sribachi Yohei went to play.

351
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
He went to play.

352
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
His chest is wide open.

353
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
He's having fun.

354
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
He's having fun.

355
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000
You can't go to a place where there are so many people.

356
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
That's why it's heavy.

357
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
That's why it's heavy.

358
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
He went like this.

359
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,000
There's no one.

360
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
There's no one.

361
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
There's no one.

362
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
There's no one.

363
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
That's right.

364
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
When I looked back,

365
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Sribachi Yohei.

366
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
That's it?

367
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
That's it?

368
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
He went to the village alone.

369
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
He went to the deserted island.

370
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
There's no one.

371
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Sribachi Yohei.

372
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
That's how he was discovered.

373
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
That's right.

374
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000
But Sribachi Yohei.

375
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,000
The number of people who use it will decrease from now on.

376
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Is that so?

377
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
It will disappear.

378
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
There are a lot of things that will disappear.

379
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
What?

380
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Because if all the old women who are alive die now,

381
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Kanzashi will disappear too.

382
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
But what?

383
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Kanzashi?

384
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
People who do that kind of work will use it.

385
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
What kind of work?

386
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
It's not a geisha.

387
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Geisha will disappear too.

388
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
That's right.

389
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Sumo will disappear too.

390
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
It's a national sport in Japan.

391
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
It will definitely disappear.

392
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Pigs are fighting against each other.

393
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Which one will win?

394
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
That's right.

395
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
It's not a geisha.

396
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
It's better to choose the strongest one.

397
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I'm not interested in sumo at all.

398
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
What are you saying now?

399
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
What?

400
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Young people.

401
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Why?

402
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Why?

403
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000
There are people like that in the Ujishima room.

404
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I will definitely win.

405
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Who are you talking about?

406
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Who is the strongest now?

407
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
The strongest?

408
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Takahana is the strongest now.

409
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I will win.

410
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I will win twice.

411
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
You said the number of times.

412
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I will win twice in a row.

413
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Really?

414
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Really.

415
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Takahana must be busy.

416
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Please come to me.

417
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Don't you see me?

418
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Please, Takahana.

419
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Takahana.

420
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Please.

421
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Come to me.

422
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Please, Takahana.

423
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Please.

424
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Please come to me.

425
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Please, Takahana.

426
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Please, Takahana.

427
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
That's a foreign manga.

428
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Please, Takahana.

429
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I will definitely win.

430
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
You are slow.

431
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I can see you when you turn around.

432
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
That's not true.

433
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
You are a fool.

434
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
You are a dinosaur.

435
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
I can see you when you turn around.

436
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
That's not true.

437
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
You are a fool.

438
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
That's not true.

439
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
You are a fool.

440
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I will definitely win.

441
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
You will not win.

442
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
If you get caught, you will be punished.

443
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I don't have a place to be caught.

444
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
What?

445
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I don't have a place to be caught.

446
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
What are you wearing?

447
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
What?

448
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
What are you wearing when you play?

449
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I don't have a place to be caught.

450
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
That's my favorite party dress.

451
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
It's a wine bottle.

452
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I don't have a place to be caught.

453
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
If you get caught, you will be punished.

454
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,000
If you get caught, you will be punished.

455
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
You should have just killed me.

456
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
It's impossible to punish you.

457
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Because you are my partner.

458
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:02,000
It will be over soon.

459
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Let's go.

460
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Booby, Booby, Booby.

461
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:13,080
I would be spending my whole life listening to this kind of apartment music

462
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:16,840
Letting myself be done right

463
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,680
Will that be reasonable to you?

464
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:25,700
Goma, Heroes, you look like it's in Campus TV

465
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,020
So I would be the kind that

466
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:30,760
would show up right on the day it's going to be sold out

467
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:31,780
Thank you

468
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,960
Now go straight to the quewing

469
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:35,900
Go from way over there

470
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:36,900
What?

471
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:41,900
Hello, I'm Henteki.

472
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:43,900
Thank you very much.

473
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:46,900
So, let me tell you something.

474
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:50,900
There will be no broadcast on Tuesday, August 13th next week.

475
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:52,900
Oh, what is this?

476
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:53,900
It's a one-time show.

477
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:55,900
Oh, I see.

478
00:20:55,900 --> 00:21:00,900
There is no broadcast for this, so the next one will be on Tuesday, August 20th.

479
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,900
Oh, I see. It's a one-time show.

480
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:06,900
Why don't we all go to Giroppon together?

481
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:12,900
That's nice.

482
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:17,900
So, we will take a break next week.

483
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:19,900
Let's meet on Tuesday, August 20th.

484
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:20,900
Yes.

485
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:23,900
So, please look forward to next week's broadcast.

486
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:24,900
Thank you.

487
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:29,900
This program was brought to you by the sponsor you are watching.
