This is the 9th episode of OMAE SOU-CHAN-KA GRAND PRIX.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Today's guests are lucky.

00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Let's go!

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Who will give me the answer?

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
These people!

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
First of all, I'd like to introduce Mr. Makoto Otake!

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Thank you!

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I didn't think you guys were human beings.

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Otodari Kano Tenmei!

12
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
It's been a while since I've seen you.

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
That's right.

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
How are you doing?

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I'm doing fine.

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
You've been on a lot of shows lately.

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I've done a lot of shows.

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Thank you for coming!

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
It's been a while since I've seen you.

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
It's been a while.

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
You should have called me.

22
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
This program is brought to you by these sponsors.

23
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
As usual, I'm in the city and doing an interview.

24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
The person who gets the answer is the winner of the grand prix.

25
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Let's get started!

26
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
The first question is...

27
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
You were asked to go buy cherries, right?

28
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
You were asked to go buy cherries, right?

29
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
This is Dan-Yu.

30
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Dan-Yu?

31
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Then it's not him.

32
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Who is it?

33
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Makihara.

34
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
He's definitely going to drive.

35
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Even if you say he's definitely going to drive...

36
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
We're interviewing 17 student salarymen.

37
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Please show us the clip.

38
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
This is what the person who interviewed me said.

39
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I don't know if he knows or not.

40
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
He's being bullied.

41
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I don't know if he knows or not.

42
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I don't know if he knows or not.

43
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
That's a given.

44
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
What do you mean by a given?

45
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
It's his job to drive.

46
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
He's being used by Hiromi to drive.

47
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Hiromi is Dan-Yu.

48
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
That's the worst.

49
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
It's Dan-Yu.

50
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I'll just say he's young.

51
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
It's not Morishige.

52
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
He's saying he's young.

53
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
If you say Dan-Yu, it's definitely Morishige.

54
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Let's go.

55
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
First, Otake.

56
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
He's definitely going to drive.

57
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
He's definitely going to drive.

58
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
He's going to drive in a commercial.

59
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Tenmei.

60
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Tenmei.

61
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Is he Issei Ishida?

62
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Issei.

63
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Issei.

64
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Matsumoto.

65
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I'm Abe Hiroo.

66
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
He's like this.

67
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Abe.

68
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
The one who drives a beer?

69
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
The one who drives a beer?

70
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
The one who drives a beer?

71
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I don't know.

72
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Takeda Shinji.

73
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Issei Ishida.

74
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Takeda Shinji.

75
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Toshiaki Karasawa.

76
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Kasedaishi.

77
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
He looks weak.

78
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Sanoshiro.

79
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Karasawa.

80
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Kimura Kazuya.

81
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
He looks weak.

82
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Takeda Shinji.

83
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Takeda Shinji.

84
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Naoki Kosaka.

85
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
He looks kind, so he's going to be taken in.

86
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Issei Ishida.

87
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Karasawa.

88
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Toshiaki Karasawa.

89
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Toshiaki Karasawa.

90
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Toshiaki Karasawa.

91
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Everyone is wrong.

92
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I thought it was the answer.

93
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
The next one is...

94
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
This one.

95
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
You're having sex without kissing.

96
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Wait a minute.

97
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Who is this?

98
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Who is this?

99
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
You're a potato.

100
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
You're a potato.

101
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
You're a potato.

102
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Who came up with this?

103
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
You're a famous woman who seems to be having sex without kissing.

104
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
That's true.

105
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
You don't have any right or wrong.

106
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
You're not being taken in by a man.

107
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Who was it?

108
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
What?

109
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
You're having sex without kissing.

110
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
What?

111
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
No, no, no.

112
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
It's you.

113
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
It took me about two hours to get ready.

114
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
You're having sex without kissing.

115
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Here you go.

116
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Who's being taken in when you're naked?

117
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Aren't you running away?

118
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
No.

119
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
It's easy.

120
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
It's easy.

121
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
You're not running away.

122
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
You're not running away.

123
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Stop it.

124
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Rewrite it.

125
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
What should I do?

126
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I'm going home.

127
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
You're running away.

128
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
No, I'm not.

129
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I'm sorry.

130
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
You can run away, but you don't have to show it.

131
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Let's go, Otake.

132
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I think this is good.

133
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I'm not Otake.

134
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I'm a critic of So-chan and the Grand Prix.

135
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I'm the closest woman to you.

136
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
That's not good.

137
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Homo is here to shop.

138
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I think it's good.

139
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Otake.

140
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I think it's a shopper.

141
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I think it's good.

142
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000

That's ***.

144
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
What?

145
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Tenmei.

146
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I'm not a shopper.

147

I don't know what to write.

151

Are you running away?

152
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I'm not running away.

I'm using this for the first time.

175
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I shouldn't be so happy when I think about it.

176
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Stand up.

177
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I've never done it before.

178
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
This is the last question.

179
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
The last question is the reverse pattern.

180
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
First, let's see who the Grand Prix is.

193
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
***

194
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
***

195
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
***

196
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
***

197
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
***

198
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
***

199
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
***

200
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
***

201
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Hitajima Saburo.

202
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
***

203
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
What is ***?

204
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
***

205
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
It's a young person.

206
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
What do you call young people?

207
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Young people who have arms and legs and move

208
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I don't know

209
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Do you have a hint?

210
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
A hint?

211
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
He's talking about a certain person

212
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
You're playing around in Nagoya, right?

213
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
You're still like this

214
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I'm still here so don't leave me

215
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I'm playing with Oda Yuji

216
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Please write it

217
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I don't think this is a common thing

218
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Let's start with Mr.Otake

219
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
You!

220
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Could it be?

221
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Yes

222
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
From XX

223
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Who told you to read it?

224
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Who told you to read it so slowly?

225
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Could it be that XX is bigger than XX?

226
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I see

227
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
You're still like this

228
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
If it's about a racer, it's a racer

229
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
It's like a raccoon

230
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
You're playing around in front of people

231
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
But you're really a playboy

232
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
There's no matcha

233
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
That's a weird story too

234
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Why is it a weird story?

235
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
If I were to use this as a reference

236
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
You're only playing with the women that Matsumoto played with

237
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
That has nothing to do with Oda Yuji

238
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Are you playing with Oda Yuji too?

239
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
That's weird

240
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
The women you played with are playing with Kurajima Samuro

241
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
That's not true

242
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Let's watch the video

243
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Who doesn't like downtown?

244
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Oda Yuji

245
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
You don't like downtown?

246
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
That's the problem

247
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
The winner is Oda Yuji

248
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Everyone is wrong

249
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I didn't have a matcha in it

250
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I'm tired of being chased

251
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
You're being chased

252
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I'm being chased

253
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
You're being chased

254
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I'm being chased because I'm being chased

255
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I'm not being chased

256
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I'm not being chased

257
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
This case is really weird

258
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
What's weird?

259
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
And...

260
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,500
I'm not talking about anything.

261
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,500
It's not connected.

262
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,500
Why would you say that?

263
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:29,500
No, no, no.

264
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,000
So...

265
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
They're denying it.

266
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,500
I'm denying it, too.

267
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,500
But the proof is in the photo.

268
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,500
Why are you so desperate?

269
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,500
No, no, no.

270
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:42,500
I'm just saying it because I can't say it in a big way.

271
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,500
If there's a photo or something,

272
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,500
I still know.

273
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:46,500
There's no photo.

274
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,500
You don't know because you say that.

275
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,500
No, no, no.

276
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,500
What's with that kid?

277
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,500
You're saying that because there's no photo.

278
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,000
Just move.

279
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,500
No, no, no.

280
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:58,500
No, no, no.

281
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,500
No, no, no.

282
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,500
No, no, no.

283
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,500
It's not cold.

284
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,000
It's not cold at all.

285
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Taka-chan!

286
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
You!

287
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
It's not cold.

288
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
It's not cold, but you're saying it's cold.

289
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
That's not good.

290
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I thought it was cold.

291
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
It's not cold at all.

292
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
The camera's out of focus.

293
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I'll laugh at anything.

294
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Especially the guest of the show.

295
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Especially the guest of the show.

296
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
That's true.

297
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
But what is it?

298
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
What have you been up to lately?

299
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
But it's that.

300
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
It's that on this show.

301
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I'm going to release the record of Geisha Girls in Japan.

302
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Oh, I see.

303
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
That's good.

304
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Are you going to buy it?

305
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
The guy who's here is going to buy it.

306
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
No, but...

307
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Are you going to be on a singing show?

308
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
A singing show?

309
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
But I don't have one right now.

310
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
You don't have one, do you?

311
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Is it that?

312
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Music Station?

313
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
The TV station?

314
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
The TV station's Music Station.

315
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
But Gyo-san, I don't know what you're talking about.

316
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
It's the same as the lyrics.

317
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
You're such a bad singer, Tamori-san.

318
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Who said that?

319
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

320
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Did you say ta?

321
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Ta?

322
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
That's what I'm saying.

323
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
No, no, no, no.

324
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Are you going to write a letter?

325
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Matsumoto-san, when a big, strong-looking person comes to you,

326
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
or when you're about to get beaten up,

327
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
you say, I'll do it if you come to me next time.

328
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Or, I won't be quiet if you come to me next time.

329
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
You say that a lot.

330
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Matsumoto-san is really strong, isn't he?

331
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Another one like that.

332
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Which one is stronger, Hama-chan or Matsumoto-chan?

333
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I see.

334
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
No, but this is that.

335
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
You...

336
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
What she's saying is right.

337
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I've never seen her move.

338
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
But,

339
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
the question is, which one is stronger, Hama-chan or Matsumoto-chan?

340
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Right?

341
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
You're like that.

342
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
You're like that.

343
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
No, I'm not.

344
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
You're strong.

345
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
You're unarmed.

346
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Why am I unarmed?

347
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
You're late in time.

348
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I'm late in time?

349
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
You're acting as a clumsy, clumsy man.

350
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I'm not acting?

351
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
You're like, what?

352
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I'm a man.

353
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I'm saying I'm a man.

354
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I'm always saying that.

355
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
What are you saying?

356
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
You're like that.

357
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I'm not saying anything.

358
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Your fashion is like a man.

359
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
What?

360
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
You're like a rice paddy.

361
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
A rice paddy is your strength.

362
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
You're like that.

363
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I don't know.

364
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
You're like a fish.

365
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
If you're grilled, it's good.

366
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
You don't need any seasoning.

367
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
You're a man of the sea.

368
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
You say things like that.

369
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I'm not saying anything.

370
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I'm not saying anything.

371
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
You never say things like that.

372
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I'm not saying anything.

373
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
It's just an episode.

374
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,000
What?

375
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
It's not an episode.

376
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
But you're sending out messages like that.

377
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I'm not sending out messages.

378
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
It's not like that.

379
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
You've been saying that you're going to apologize for the yakuza.

380
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:05,000
You're making me look like a man.

381
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
What are you trying to say?

382
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Are you jealous?

383
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
It's not like that.

384
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I don't want to be looked down on.

385
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I want to be strong.

386
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I want to say it out loud.

387
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I don't think so.

388
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
It's not a club.

389
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I don't want to be looked down on.

390
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
See?

391
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
That's all.

392
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
You don't want to be looked down on.

393
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:34,000
But I don't care about that at work.

394
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
It's not like that.

395
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Why?

396
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
It's not like that.

397
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:45,000
If you look at downtown, most people think that Hamada is stronger.

398
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:51,000
But in reality, you don't know until you think about it.

399
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Yes, I understand.

400
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Did you do any sports?

401
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I did kendo for a year when I was in high school.

402
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Kendo?

403
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I did judo.

404
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Only Matsumoto's technique.

405
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
What do you mean technique?

406
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
If you use Matsumoto's technique, you can eat as much rice as you want.

407
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I don't care.

408
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I'm not weak at all.

409
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:24,000
If you eat as much rice as you want, you can eat as much rice as you want.

410
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Matsumoto's technique means that you can eat as much rice as you want.

411
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:35,000
That's how good it is.

412
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Who said that?

413
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I don't care.

414
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Can I use your technique?

415
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Don't say such things.

416
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
It's okay.

417
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Do you know how many people use your technique?

418
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I don't know.

419
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
How many people?

420
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Kami shihō gatame.

421
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Kami shihō gatame doesn't mean that you can use your technique.

422
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
You can use your technique.

423
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:12,000
It means you enjoy eating.

424
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I'm asking you to use your technique.

425
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Don't you understand?

426
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:22,000
If you hurt your partner, who will be happy?

427
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
It's okay.

428
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
If you say so, I won't hurt you.

429
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Before you fall?

430
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Yes.

431
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
You'll fall soon.

432
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Will I fall?

433
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
You'll fall.

434
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
You'll fall and lose consciousness for a while.

435
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Really?

436
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Yes.

437
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I have to do it hard.

438
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I'll give you a sign before you fall.

439
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Really?

440
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Yes.

441
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Please.

442
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
What should I do?

443
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
What do you mean?

444
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
What should I do?

445
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Can I stand here?

446
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Please tell me what you want me to do.

447
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
What do you want me to do?

448
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Please tell me.

449
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Please tell me what you want me to do.

450
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Well...

451
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Koso-de tsuri.

452
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Koso-de tsuri?

453
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Koso-de tsuri from Tsuriyashi.

454
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Koso-de?

455
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
From Tsuyasu to Koso-de tsuri?

456
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
What do you want me to do?

457
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I don't know.

458
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
What do you want me to do?

459
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Can I stand here?

460
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I'll give you a sign.

461
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Wait, wait, wait.

462
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Don't do it hard.

463
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
I have to hold it here.

464
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
I know that.

465
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Don't do it hard.

466
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
It hurts.

467
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Koso-de tsuri.

468
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Please.

469
00:19:53,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Please.

470
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Don't do it hard.

471
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Please.

472
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Don't do it hard.

473
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Please.

474
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Don't do it hard.

475
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Don't do it hard.

476
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Don't do it hard.

477
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I told you you shouldn't do it hard.

478
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
You have to leave your body to do it.

479
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
I was talking.

480
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
You were falling for a moment.

481
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
I was talking.

482
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
I was talking.

483
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
It's bad.

484
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I woke you up.

485
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
I didn't know for a moment.

486
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
It's bad.

487
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
It's a little bit.

488
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
It's a little bit.

489
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
It's forbidden here.

490
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Because it's sweet.

491
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Because it's sweet?

492
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
It's too sweet.

493
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
This is...

494
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
In the past, you dropped it many times.

495
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
I dropped it.

496
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
The other day, I went to see the UWF.

497
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
It's a bad thing.

498
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
It's forbidden.

499
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Love is not a fun thing.

500
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
It's a painful thing.

501
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,000
How can a man cheat on his love?

502
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
What kind of theory is that?

503
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
You know.

504
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I think it's okay to get married.

505
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Who?

506
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Me.

507
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
It's okay to get married.

508
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
No.

509
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Don't say it in a small voice.

510
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I don't think it's okay to play with other women after marriage.

511
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Don't say such a beautiful thing.

512
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
If you do it, you will do it.

513
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I'm scared.

514
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
I'm not saying scary things.

515
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Adults say I'm bald.

516
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:36,000
