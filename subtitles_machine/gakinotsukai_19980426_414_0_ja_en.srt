1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Yamazaki Ichiban, Yamazaki Ichiban, Yamazaki Ichiban

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
This is good.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
It's a good song.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
No, it's not a good song.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Something's wrong.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Good morning.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
What's wrong?

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Did I say something wrong?

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
What's wrong?

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Something's wrong.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
What is it?

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I haven't come here yet.

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
You haven't come yet?

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
No.

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I think there's something different about coming here.

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
What's different?

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
What's different?

18
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I think there's something better.

19
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I think this program will be more exciting.

20
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Do you think so?

21
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Well, I'll say it.

22
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Actually, I read it from Osaka.

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I read it or I've been relying on it.

24
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
He's got a lot of skills, so I wonder what he's like.

25
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
A driver?

26
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Yeah, I'll introduce him.

27
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Is there anyone?

28
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Come in.

29
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Excuse me.

30
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Hello.

31
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Hello.

32
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Excuse me.

33
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Um, um...

34
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The Ritten Investigation Team.

35
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
The Ritten Investigation Team.

36
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Mizuno Tooru, 37 years old.

37
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Fujiwara Mitsuhiro, 35 years old.

38
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Since the Showa era, they have been doing a lot of comedic things, but this time they have decided to move to Tokyo.

39
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
They will challenge a new battle against Kokoriko, by putting their lives on the line in the entertainment world.

40
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I'll make you pay for this!

41
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
This program is brought to you by the sponsors you see here.

42
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Let's decide whether to make him a little boy or not.

43
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Oh, that's a good idea.

44
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Let's decide.

45
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
After all, Riton has the power to do that.

46
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
That's right.

47
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Well, that's the same for little boy.

48
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
What can't you do?

49
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Riton can do anything.

50
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
He has a lot of ideas.

51
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
We can do anything.

52
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Anything.

53
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I'll tell you a little.

54
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Let's go with that.

55
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Let's go with goldfish.

56
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
It's an easy story.

57
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
You can make goldfish?

58
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Yes, I can.

59
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Really?

60
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Of course.

61
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I can do that much.

62
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I can't do that.

63
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I'll go.

64
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I always eat rice balls and this.

65
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
You're the same as me.

66
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
It's okay.

67
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I drank only water.

68
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
It's OK.

69
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I drank it!

70
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
What are you doing?

71
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
What are you doing?

72
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
You are doing this.

73
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
This is really amazing as a man.

74
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Really?

75
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Bad Oli.

76
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
If you have this, you can break it.

77
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
This...

78
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Can you do it?

79
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I don't know where my feet are.

80
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
You should kick here.

81
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I don't know where my feet are.

82
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
You should kick here.

83
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
This is wrong?

84
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Well, for now...

85
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I don't know where my feet are.

86
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
You hit it right away.

87
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I'll go.

88
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
You're so serious.

89
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
It broke!

90
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Amazing!

91
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Look! It broke here!

92
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Did you see that? I was really surprised.

93
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I'm so jealous.

94
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Let's have a tension match.

95
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
It's so high.

96
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
It's so high.

97
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Let's go.

98
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Let's go.

99
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Wow!

100
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I can't do it!

101
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
End!

102
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Funny!

103
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Thank you.

104
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Now, it's fun, but...

105
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
If Mizuno were here, he wouldn't be able to do that.

106
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Really?

107
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
He's already gone.

108
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Human nuclear power!

109
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Human nuclear power!

110
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Human nuclear power!

111
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Human electronic power!

112
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Ah, it's hot!

113
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Ah, it's hot!

114
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Water, water, it's cold.

115
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
It's not cold!

116
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
What's this?

117
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
There's a towel underneath.

118
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Well, well, well, that was...

119
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Well, well, well, that was...

120
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Well, there are things like that.

121
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
It's different.

122
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Ah, it's hot!

123
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Ah, it's hot!

124
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Ah, it's hot!

125
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Ah, it's hot!

126
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Ah, it's hot!

127
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I can't stand it anymore!

128
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I can't stand it anymore!

129
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I'm done!

130
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I'm done!

131
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I get it, I get it, I get it.

132
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Hey!

133
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Let's do the same thing.

134
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
What can you do?

135
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Bicycle, tires, live-stay.

136
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I'm good at this.

137
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,500
Right?

138
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,000
It's not that hard.

139
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
It's quite bouncy.

140
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
That's the other way around.

141
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:05,500
It stops.

142
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:21,360
A

143
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,360
I'm gonna hit you!

144
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,360
Stop him!

145
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,360
I'm gonna hit you!

146
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,360
Leave it to me!

147
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,360
I'm gonna hit you!

148
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,360
Stop him!

149
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,360
Alright!

150
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,360
Alright!

151
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,360
Alright!

152
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,360
One shot!

153
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,360
Alright!

154
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,360
You're gonna do this!

155
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,360
If you're Japanese, then let's do a Japanese dance!

156
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,360
Japanese dance?

157
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,360
A battle to save the soil!

158
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,360
We can't do this, it's the last one!

159
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,360
Start!

160
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,360
Stop!

161
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,360
Stop!

162
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,360
It's not funny at all.

163
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,360
I wonder what it is.

164
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,360
I thought of it as soon as it started.

165
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,360
I ate Hamada-san's noodles as soon as it started.

166
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,360
I should have stopped it a little earlier.

167
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:34,360
I thought about it a lot, but I think it's a good idea.

168
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,360
That's right.

169
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,360
That's right.

170
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,360
That's right.

171
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,360
That's right.

172
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,360
Well...

173
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,360
That's right.

174
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,360
That's right.

175
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,360
Isn't it?

176
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,360
Well, but...

177
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,360
How is it?

178
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,360
Well, is it worse than before?

179
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,360
Before the Maesetsu?

180
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,360
Well, you've done a lot of shows in Osaka.

181
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,360
What kind of shows?

182
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,360
Tell me.

183
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,360
Like the academic sandwich.

184
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,360
That's right.

185
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,360
Hey, you're thinking about the show now.

186
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,360
That's right.

187
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,360
That's right.

188
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,360
And that.

189
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,360
And the planning office.

190
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,360
It's 4 o'clock on the 4th of the 3rd week.

191
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,360
And the after-setsu.

192
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,360
And the after-setsu.

193
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,360
What is it?

194
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,360
And the after-setsu.

195
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,360
I don't know if we'll be able to do it after the show.

196
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,360
We have to calm down the excited audience.

197
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,360
The audience will not be able to enter.

198
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,360
The elevator in the first floor?

199
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,360
After that, we have to do it for an hour and ten minutes after the show.

200
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,360
Can we do it?

201
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,360
You guys don't know about the Kage-tsu.

202
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,360
If you look at the front, there are people who are doing it.

203
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,360
Yoshimoto is funny.

204
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,360
I'm just a TV show.

205
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,360
Have you ever been on Kage-tsu?

206
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,360
Why can't you be on TV with such a saying?

207
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,360
So I don't care if I sell or make money.

208
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,360
I don't love you!

209
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,360
Don't laugh!

210
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,360
I don't love you!

211
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,360
Do you understand?

212
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,360
We lost.

213
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,360
We lost.

214
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,360
We lost.

215
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:49,360
We were talking about losing, but we couldn't win.

216
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,360
You're right.

217
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,360
We lost.

218
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:55,360
Then, please give a speech today.

219
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,360
Thank you.

220
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,360
Today's speech...

221
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,360
Please give a speech for the kids.

222
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,360
Please.

223
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,360
It's your fault.

224
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,360
What the hell?

225
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,360
What the hell?

226
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,360
What the hell?

227
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,360
You have to admit defeat.

228
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,360
It's not like that.

229
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,360
It's like a ball.

230
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,360
It's easier to explain than to admit defeat.

231
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,360
It's not like that.

232
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,360
Please.

233
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,360
I can't play ball.

234
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,360
You guys are here to see.

235
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,360
I can't help it.

236
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,360
What are you doing?

237
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,360
What's going on with the audience?

238
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,360
What's going on?

239
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,360
Are you ready?

240
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,360
Yes, we are.

241
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,360
Let's go.

242
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,360
Please.

243
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,360
Please.

244
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,360
Can we go?

245
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,360
We are waiting for the audience.

246
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,360
The audience is waiting.

247
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,360
Please.

248
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,360
It's been a long time.

249
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,360
We talked about this when we were on the show.

250
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,360
We were on the show.

251
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,360
Pants and pants.

252
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,360
Hello!

253
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,360
You're quite popular!

254
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,360
I'm happy.

255
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,360
Please stand up quickly.

256
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,360
This is the stage for the kids.

257
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,360
I'm happy to be standing there.

258
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,360
Everyone's listening.

259
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,360
I'm getting angry.

260
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,360
There are three cameras. One camera, two cameras, one lady, one camera.

261
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,360
After this, the audience's tension dropped.

262
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,360
Good job.

263
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,360
Good job.

264
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,360
I want to do the interview.

265
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,360
Please, Mr. Matsumoto.

266
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,360
Your back is round.

267
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,360
Can I come next Wednesday?

268
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:57,360
I'm going home.

269
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,360
Idiot!

270
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:03,360
Idiot!

271
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,360
Idiot!

272
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:10,360
Idiot!

273
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,360
Like this?

274
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:24,360
It's like a ball.

275
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,360
It's been a while.

276
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,360
The player is...

277
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,360
He's wearing his brother's uniform.

278
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,360
Who's his brother?

279
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,360
Ah, his brother.

280
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,360
His brother is really stupid.

281
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,360
He didn't disappear for a long time.

282
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,360
But it's gone!

283
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,360
It's gone!

284
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,360
That guy is an idiot!

285
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,360
It was really on.

286
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,360
It was still on.

287
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,360
It was still on.

288
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,360
It was on, right?

289
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,360
I ignored it like it was normal.

290
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,360
I ignored it too.

291
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,360
It's scary.

292
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:05,360
If you go out after that, what will people say?

293
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:09,360
He's still saying something cute because it's a home phone.

294
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,360
I've heard it a few times.

295
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,360
Hello? Hello? It's Akko.

296
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,360
I've heard it like that.

297
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:21,360
What is that?

298
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,360
It's like, the signal is bad.

299
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,360
It's like, what? What?

300
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,360
It's like, when you're with a girl,

301
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,360
you say hello, and it's a girl.

302
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,360
Hello? Hello?

303
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,360
I was like, this is bad, I'm going to call her.

304
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,360
That happens, right?

305
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,360
No.

306
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,360
I didn't know you did that.

307
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,360
Your cell phone is annoying.

308
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,360
Well, that's true.

309
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,360
Especially when you're talking about important things.

310
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,360
Yes, yes.

311
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:53,360
If you're having dinner with a girl,

312
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,360
that girl's cell phone won't work.

313
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,360
I don't know why, but the signal is weak.

314
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,360
Mine works.

315
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,360
I've been asked to lend my phone once.

316
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,360
When I was on the phone, she said,

317
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,360
I got a call.

318
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,360
I was so excited.

319
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,360
If you get a call, you can't refuse.

320
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,360
You can't refuse.

321
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,360
I was like,

322
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,360
Hello? Hello?

323
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,360
I hung up.

324
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,360
I hung up.

325
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,360
You were talking clearly.

326
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,360
The woman in front of me was like,

327
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,360
I'm a little...

328
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:33,360
I'm a little confused.

329
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,360
You're looking at me with a doubtful look.

330
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:41,360
It's not the day it started, but I have insomnia for a long time.

331
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,360
You say that again.

332
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,360
It's been a long time.

333
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,360
I should have waited for a lifetime.

334
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,360
That's fine.

335
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:53,360
People who have never had insomnia will not understand, but you think it's okay because you can sleep, right?

336
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,360
I'm sleepy but I can't sleep. Do you understand?

337
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,360
Can you sleep right away?

338
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,360
That depends on the day.

339
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,360
You're a fool. You can sleep right away.

340
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,360
I'm a smart worker.

341
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,360
I can think of many things even if I have a futon.

342
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,360
I can't sleep.

343
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,360
I don't know that.

344
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,360
When you're in a bad situation, at 12 o'clock...

345
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,360
...

346
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,360
...

347
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,360
I can't sleep until noon.

348
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,360
It's hell.

349
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,360
But that's because you're not feeling well.

350
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,360
I make a futon at 4 o'clock.

351
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,360
And it's like this at 4 o'clock.

352
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,360
And it's like this at 5 o'clock.

353
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,360
It's a little different.

354
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,360
And it's like this at 6 o'clock.

355
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:45,360
And then at 7 o'clock, he's like this again.

356
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:50,360
He's like, what the hell did I do earlier?

357
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:53,360
And then, at about 8 o'clock, he's like this again.

358
00:14:53,360 --> 00:15:01,360
Please laugh a little.

359
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,360
You're crazy.

360
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,360
It's true.

361
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:07,360
But that's your rhythm, right?

362
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:17,360
But, when I'm next to you and watching you, I can't do anything.

363
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,360
That might change a little.

364
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,360
No way!

365
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,360
I don't like it either.

366
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,360
Why do you keep looking at me until I fall asleep?

367
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,360
But, you know,

368
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,360
I guess it's because you're alone.

369
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:31,360
If there's someone next to you, you might be able to sleep a little longer.

370
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,360
That's not relevant.

371
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,360
Well, this one.

372
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,360
This one and this one.

373
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:40,360
You're avoiding it.

374
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:45,360
This one and this one are this.

375
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,360
That's why...

376
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,360
I'll kill you!

377
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,360
It's sad to be alone.

378
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:55,360
Yuta, you're the only one in the world.

379
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,360
It's not like that.

380
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,360
It's not like that?

381
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,360
It's not like that.

382
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:03,360
But I think it's better to be more popular.

383
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,360
I don't know that!

384
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,360
It's not that bad.

385
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,360
You're just a little bit.

386
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,360
What's this?

387
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,360
What's this?

388
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,360
What's this?

389
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,360
Go home!

390
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,360
Who's going to do this?

391
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:35,360
I have to do something to sleep.

392
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,360
Do you have a sleep-over?

393
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:41,360
If you do that, will you have it?

394
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,360
No, I can do it at home.

395
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,360
I can buy a sleep-over at the opening.

396
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:49,360
I can put a CCD in your room.

397
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:54,360
You will never sleep with that kind of thing.

398
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:57,360
If you don't sleep, I don't care if you cry or not.

399
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,360
I don't want to cry.

400
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,360
Who's going to check it?

401
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,360
It's embarrassing, my house.

402
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,360
You're so insensitive.

403
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:08,360
It's like a death camp.

404
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:11,360
I remember this room.

405
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:17,360
I want to show you the death camp.

406
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:18,360
I remember. I remember.

407
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:19,360
I don't care about this.

408
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,360
You're like that.

409
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:23,360
It seems that you have completed the game in a grand way.

410
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:29,360
I heard rumors!

411
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,360
What a big voice!

412
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,360
It seems that you are living in a great place.

413
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,360
It's not a great place.

414
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,360
Let's get into the camera.

415
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,360
I can't get in!

416
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:40,360
I want to see it a little.

417
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,360
I want to see it.

418
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,360
You know.

419
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,360
No, no, no.

420
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,360
You can't live in such a grand place.

421
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:51,920
Gonten is the

422
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:57,920
Why are you laughing?

423
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:01,920
Why are you laughing?

424
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:05,920
Hey! You shouldn't show that!

425
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,920
That's not good for the show!

426
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,920
But it's amazing!

427
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,920
It's not amazing!

428
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,920
Who said that?

429
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,920
There's something like a observatory

430
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,920
What are you doing?

431
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,920
I'm just looking at something.

432
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:20,920
What are you looking at?

433
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,920
I'm looking at the stars.

434
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,920
You're not looking at anything.

435
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,920
I'm surprised.

436
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,920
What are you doing?

437
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:39,920
To make the boys and girls of the whole country better,

438
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:43,920
Matsuho-san said that he was busy on his day off with patrols.

439
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:44,920
Thank you.

440
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:49,920
If you were to be a father-in-law in the city, what would you do?

441
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:54,920
This is... well, I don't care, you have to think about it.

442
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,920
You are already a father, right?

443
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,920
But I don't have any other clothes.

444
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,920
You have clothes? You're wearing a double.

445
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,920
Double?

446
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,920
The school uniform was the same, Ichio.

447
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:15,920
You're double!

448
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,920
I'm double five times!

449
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:21,920
You're double five times!

450
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,920
I'm going to go!

451
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,920
I'm already at the age of 44.

452
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,920
That's because I'm old.

453
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,920
I'm not double.

454
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,920
You should think about it. You'll have a father later.

455
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,920
But I don't have a father.

456
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,920
What should I do?

457
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,920
You have a father.

458
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,920
Let's talk about something good today.

459
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:40,920
Let's talk about spilling.

460
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,920
No, spilling is not good.

461
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:46,920
Let's get to the point. Spilling is not good.

462
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:47,920
It's okay.

463
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:48,920
Yes.

464
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,920
There are people who watch you.

465
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:53,920
My father is walking around Shibuya and other places.

466
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,920
There are a lot of young people around him.

467
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:58,920
How many people are there?

468
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,920
Let's say 10 people.

469
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:03,920
There are a lot of young people around him.

470
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:10,920
At this time, there are 10 young men, so there is definitely one old man who smells like an old man.

471
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:11,920
I see.

472
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:12,920
That's right.

473
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,920
There are some who don't look like the same age.

474
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:15,920
That's right.

475
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:16,920
There is definitely one.

476
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:17,920
Someone who doesn't look like the same age.

477
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:18,920
That's right.

478
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:19,920
That's right.

479
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,920
First of all, I look for such a guy.

480
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,920
What are you guys?

481
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:24,920
While saying,

482
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:25,920
What are you guys?

483
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:26,920
While looking for it,

484
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:27,920
Don't come!

485
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:28,920
While saying that,

486
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,920
The most old man who smells like an old man is...

487
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,920
Father!

488
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:38,920
What is the most unfortunate thing in this world?

489
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:40,920
This is a bit...

490
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:42,920
It's a bit...

491
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,920
What do you think?

492
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,920
What do you think of a fool being a fool?

493
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,920
In places that are said by the general public,

494
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:52,920
you say things like,

495
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:55,920
the one who is dead before the parents.

496
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,920
That's right.

497
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,920
Is that okay?

498
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:02,920
Is that okay?

499
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:05,920
The record will be left.

500
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:08,920
The record will be left?

501
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:09,920
Listen carefully.

502
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,920
What is the most unfortunate thing in this world?

503
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:16,920
What is the most unfortunate thing in this world?

504
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:20,920
Listen carefully.

505
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:23,920
The most unfortunate thing in this world is...

506
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:29,920
It's time to think about what is the best parent-child relationship in the world.

507
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,920
Thank you very much.

508
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,920
OK.

509
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,920
I'm about to cry.

510
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,920
I don't like this.

511
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:53,920
You don't know that, do you?

512
00:21:53,920 --> 00:22:00,920
If I say that I'm planning to do it, it's a standing operation.

513
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,920
Standing operation?

514
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,920
Standing operation.

515
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,920
What do you call it?

516
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:14,920
What do you call it?

517
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,920
It's not an operation, is it?

518
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,920
What do you call it?

519
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:19,920
What?

520
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,920
Really?

521
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:23,920
Please.

522
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,920
What?

523
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,920
What? What?

524
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:28,920
What?

525
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,920
What?

526
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:36,920
If it's true, then it's a thumbing operation.

527
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,920
Why? I was just trying to fool you.

528
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,920
With words like thumbing.

529
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,920
Everyone was like, wow! And I was doing this.

530
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:51,920
I'm sorry, can you say it again?

531
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:56,920
I'm sorry, I'll start from the beginning.

532
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,920
I'm sorry.

533
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,920
Masumasa-san, I'm sorry.

534
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:19,920
You don't seem to know anything at all.

535
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:23,920
It's just a continuation of the story.

536
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:24,920
What's wrong?

537
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:27,420
What is the most unfortunate thing in this world?

538
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:29,420
The most unfortunate thing in this world?

539
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:30,420
Yes.

540
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:31,420
I should say that?

541
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:32,420
Yes.

542
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:34,420
Then, I'll do it.

543
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:45,420
The most...

544
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:48,920
the most...

545
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:52,420
unfortunate thing in this world is...

546
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:57,420
This is the time when I thought about what the best clothes in the world are.

547
00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:58,420
What?

548
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:08,420
From me.

549
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:11,420
From me, the best clothes, the second best clothes, all the way.

550
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:13,420
Come on, Binten.

551
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:18,420
Thank you for watching!
