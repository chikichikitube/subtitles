1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
This program is brought to you by the following sponsors.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Good evening.

3
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I'm glad you're doing well.

4
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Yes.

5
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
How are you doing recently?

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Ah!

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
How's this summer?

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Summer?

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Are you getting on well?

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
With this summer's boom?

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Well, well, well, I'm getting on somehow.

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I heard you released another song.

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I can't help it.

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I've been telling you for a long time.

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Come ask me for a favor.

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I can't believe you can write such a wonderful song.

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
You're not going to make a proper song, are you?

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm not going to make it!

19
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
You're not going to make it, are you?

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
That's why I'm in the Comical department.

21
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Don't tell me on TV that you're talking about ***.

22
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
At the music station, it's ***.

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
That's right.

24
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Tamori's glasses will break.

25
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Why would they break?

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Who is it this time? The songwriter?

27
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
It's an amateur.

28
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Ah, is that so?

29
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
It was sent to a complete amateur.

30
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Ah, is that so?

31
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
The arranger made it properly.

32
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
If that's the case, I'd like you to let me write a song that will inspire you.

33
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Can you do it?

34
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Of course I can.

35
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I have a lot of stuff.

36
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
What stuff?

37
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Stuff like stocks.

38
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
What do you mean?

39
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
There's no point in making it.

40
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I don't want to talk about your private life.

41
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
You have a lot of stuff.

42
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I don't want to talk about it, but I have tape.

43
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
What do you call it?

44
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
A tape recorder.

45
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
What?

46
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
It's a tape recorder.

47
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I don't have anything to brag about.

48
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I don't have anything to brag about.

49
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I always put it in the car.

50
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
If I come up with a phrase, I put it in like this.

51
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
It's true. It's really true.

52
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
It's true.

53
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I thought it was funny, so I put it in.

54
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I still know, but...

55
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
You put in a phrase for a song?

56
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I put in a phrase for a song.

57
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I put in a lot of 60-minute tape.

58
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Let me hear it this time.

59
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
What kind of phrase do you put in?

60
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I've been working on it for a long time, so I play it and listen to it.

61
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Of course, I play my own phrase all the time.

62
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Really?

63
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I'm a studious man.

64
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Even if you put in a lot of phrases, it's not all in one, right?

65
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:27,000
It's not all in one, but when I want a song, I put it in.

66
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
You put it in one?

67
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Yes.

68
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Can you do that?

69
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Of course I can.

70
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
You can?

71
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Yes.

72
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I can.

73
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
If you can, I'd like to hear it.

74
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I don't get a lot of requests, so I wonder what they're doing.

75
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
You're all so slow.

76
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I've been waiting here for a long time.

77
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I see.

78
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I'm glad I asked you instead of that stupid old man.

79
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I see.

80
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
So if you want a love song, I can do it.

81
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Of course, I can do comedy.

82
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
And what else...

83
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Rambada.

84
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Rambada is good.

85
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Even if you sing it now.

86
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
But it's going to be a bit of a rambada boom.

87
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
That can't be. It ended a long time ago.

88
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
If it's a rambada, let's talk seriously.

89
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Let's talk about the boom.

90
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000
If it's a rambada, I think it's going to be a daikon mochi boom.

91
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Daikon mochi?

92
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Daikon mochi?

93
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
What's daikon mochi?

94
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
It's a Chinese dish made with a little bit of daikon.

95
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I'm sorry about that.

96
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
But that's all I can say.

97
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
You don't know much, do you?

98
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I don't.

99
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
But this is really good.

100
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
It's been around for a long time.

101
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
But it's not as popular as daikon mochi.

102
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
It's a daikon mochi boom.

103
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
It's going to be a big hit.

104
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
But Chinese people can't eat it.

105
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
They can't.

106
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
It's going to spread to the general public.

107
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
It's going to spread to the general public.

108
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Probably.

109
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
That's why the termites were really popular at one point.

110
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I'm sorry.

111
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I'm sorry.

112
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I just hit right here.

113
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I'm really sorry.

114
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I hit right here.

115
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I'm sorry.

116
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I'm sorry.

117
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
But that's how it is.

118
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Really?

119
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Seriously.

120
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
What kind of taste is it?

121
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
It's not that it's delicious.

122
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
It's crispy and the inside is crunchy.

123
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I don't get it.

124
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I don't get it.

125
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
It's like me.

126
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
It's crispy and the inside is crunchy.

127
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
It's like me.

128
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
It's like me.

129
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
It's an understatement.

130
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
It's an understatement.

131
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
It's good that you say that.

132
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
You should request this.

133
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
We'll make it properly.

134
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
But what kind of song is it?

135
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
You want to be number one, don't you?

136
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
No.

137
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Right?

138
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
If you want to be number one,

139
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Hitoshi Matsumoto is number one.

140
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I'm sure of it.

141
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
But I've never heard a song.

142
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
No, no, no, I made this.

143
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
When I heard it, I was like, oh, really?

144
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
If it's going to be like that...

145
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I'll ask everyone to watch it on TV.

146
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Then, let's give you a sample of a good one.

147
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Ah, that kind of thing, it's better to show it.

148
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Ah, because it's a comedy.

149
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
It's a love song.

150
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
There's one that I put in.

151
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I heard it today, so I remembered it.

152
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Does it have a title?

153
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
No, well, I'll add it later.

154
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Ah, I see.

155
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Well, now it's become an a cappella.

156
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Of course, it is.

157
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I like you.

158
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
What kind of joke is that?

159
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
What kind of joke is that?

160
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
It's like a love song.

161
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
What do you mean, I like you?

162
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
It's the way it goes in.

163
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
It's okay, it's okay. Listen until the end.

164
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
It's not like that here yet.

165
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I like you.

166
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I like you.

167
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
What kind of lyrics is that?

168
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
What is it?

169
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
You haven't done it yet, have you?

170
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
No, I haven't done it yet.

171
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
The instrument goes in there.

172
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
If that's the case, do it like this.

173
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Ah, I'm sorry.

174
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I don't think it's worth it.

175
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.

176
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
It's not like that.

177
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Why is it that only the sound comes in after two phrases?

178
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Keep singing.

179
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Love songs are usually like Tokunaga.

180
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Ah, Tokunaga Nyan.

181
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Tokunaga Nyan.

182
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
You have to think of it like that.

183
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I like you.

184
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
For example, in a music station,

185
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Next, Hama-chan,

186
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Please go, please stand by.

187
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
This week's number one, Hama Wagoji-san.

188
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I like you.

189
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Just like that?

190
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
There's nothing like a prelude.

191
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
You have to sing it as hard as you can.

192
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I like you.

193
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I like you.

194
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Then, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.

195
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
It's long.

196
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
It's long.

197
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
It's getting longer by the minute.

198
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
It's long.

199
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
That's strange.

200
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
That's strange.

201
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
You're the only one who can sing.

202
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
That's why it's incomplete.

203
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
It's a sample.

204
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
If I get a request, I'll make it.

205
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
It's been a long time since then.

206
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
The instruments keep coming in.

207
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.

208
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
So, one by one,

209
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
It's a pattern of me and me.

210
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
It's coming together.

211
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Everyone's here.

212
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Everyone's in front of me.

213
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Again, I like you.

214
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
At this time, everyone's in one line.

215
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Tamori-san is smiling.

216
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Gura-san is shining, too.

217
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
It's okay if I don't shine.

218
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Is that a love song?

219
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
It's a love song, right?

220
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Because you said you liked it.

221
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
It's a conversation, isn't it?

222
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
You said you liked it.

223
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I like that kind of thing.

224
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
After all, a love song is a encounter between a man and a woman.

225
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I'd like you to scurry away.

226
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
What do you mean?

227
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
What is scurry away?

228
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Dan-dan-dan-dan-dan-dan.

229
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:55,000
...Dan-dan-dan-dan.

230
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Gradually, gradually.

231
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
What about that?

232
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
What, what, what, what?

233
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I'm sure your heart is beating fast right now.

234
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:13,000
But you have to give me 4-5 million yen.

235
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
What?

236
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
What do you mean?

237
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
The commission fee.

238
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Of course.

239
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
It's that expensive?

240
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Of course.

241
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
If it's you, it's expensive.

242
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
If it's not you, I'll take a little more.

243
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
But, you know, I've known you for a long time.

244
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
And you're wearing a red shirt.

245
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Don't cry.

246
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I'm glad it's red.

247
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Ah, really?

248
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Yes, really.

249
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Can I think about it a little?

250
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Ah, sure.

251
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Well, if there's someone among the audience who wants it,

252
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
If you have 4-5 million yen, I'll give it to you.

253
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
But if you buy it, you'll definitely sell it, right?

254
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Of course, I'll sell it a lot.

255
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
What are you talking about?

256
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Especially you, you're a little cheap.

257
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Ah, sorry.

258
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
My shoes hit the floor.

259
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Really.

260
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
This is a question for Matsumoto-san, the re-emergence of Black Jack.

261
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Yes.

262
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,000
During the surgery, if the doctor says something like a mess or a sweat,

263
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
the nurse who is doing the surgery will immediately respond.

264
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Ah.

265
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
They'll hand it over and wipe it off, right?

266
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Yes, yes, yes.

267
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
How much do they respond to your request?

268
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Please tell me the limit of the surgery.

269
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I see.

270
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
You often see it in dramas, right?

271
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Well, in dramas...

272
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
If you want to see the actual scene, you have no choice but to become a patient.

273
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
That's right.

274
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
But if you become a patient, it means that the anesthesia is working.

275
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Therefore, it's something that ordinary people like us don't understand.

276
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
In that sense, everyone is certainly interested, right?

277
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
That's right.

278
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Well, I understand it. I know it.

279
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
When I say it, I might think,

280
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
ah, it's not that easy.

281
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
But basically, it's two words.

282
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Two words?

283
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
If it's two characters, anything is okay.

284
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I see.

285
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Sweat.

286
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Yes.

287
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Mess.

288
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Like this.

289
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
But there are long ones in the equipment, too.

290
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
For example, the one to stop.

291
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
What do you mean, the one to stop?

292
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I don't know that.

293
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
It's the one to stop.

294
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
You're a katakana!

295
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
No, the one to stop is,

296
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I'll stop.

297
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I'll stop.

298
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
That's what you have to do, right?

299
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
If I say, I'll stop,

300
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
he'll stop.

301
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
If you say, I'll stop,

302
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
he'll say yes.

303
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I won't lie.

304
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
You won't lie?

305
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
You won't lie?

306
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
That's what it is.

307
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Basically, it's two characters.

308
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
It's two characters.

309
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
What do you mean?

310
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Other than sweat and mess.

311
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
It's a nose, right?

312
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
What?

313
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
It's a nose, right?

314
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
A nose?

315
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
What's a nose?

316
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
It's a nose.

317
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
There are times when a nose comes out.

318
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
There's definitely a nose.

319
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
But you're not wearing a mask, so you can't see it.

320
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
That's why you have to say, I'm a nose.

321
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
That's a joke!

322
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I'm a nose.

323
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
If it comes out, it's fine.

324
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
So you say, yes.

325
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
It's all two characters, right?

326
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Yes, that's right.

327
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Isn't there a more formal way to say it?

328
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
There's no other way to say it?

329
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I won't put in words that are stuck together.

330
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Don't open your mouth.

331
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
So when you open it,

332
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
you say, I'm a nose.

333
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I'm a nose.

334
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I'm a nose.

335
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:49,000
If it's worse than you think, you say, I'm a nose.

336
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I quit today.

337
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
There are times like that.

338
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
It's all two characters.

339
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
That's strange.

340
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Enka singers often sing while clenching their fists.

341
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Yes.

342
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
What's inside the clenched fist?

343
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Please tell me.

344
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
What do you think this is?

345
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
There's nothing inside.

346
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
There's no way that's true.

347
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:18,000
When they sing, they do this.

348
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,000
But there must be a reason why only Enka singers clench their fists.

349
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I don't think there is.

350
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Other singers don't clench their fists like that.

351
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
It's rare for Enka singers to clench their fists.

352
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Kitajima, Saburo, Hosokawa, Takashi.

353
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Who are they? Hosokawa, Takashi.

354
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Kitajima, Saburo, and Hosokawa, Takashi.

355
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
There are two of them.

356
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Two?

357
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Everyone clenches their fists.

358
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Everyone clenches their fists.

359
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
There must be a reason why only Enka singers clench their fists.

360
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
It's easier to sing.

361
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Or a pose.

362
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
A pose for Enka singers.

363
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I've been watching Kitajima, Saburo for a long time.

364
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
They clench their fists.

365
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Really?

366
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,000
They clench their fists in the dressing room.

367
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
What are they doing?

368
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
They must be working now.

369
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
That's right.

370
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
They clench their fists in the dressing room?

371
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
They raise their spirits.

372
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
That's good.

373
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
They don't raise their spirits by clenching their fists.

374
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
That makes them more excited.

375
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
If I say too much, I'll get scolded.

376
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
It's okay. Tell me.

377
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:25,000
It's their favorite food.

378
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Kitajima, Saburo usually clench their fists.

379
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
They sing like this.

380
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Then they say,

381
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I'm going to eat this later.

382
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Then they say,

383
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Ha!

384
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Then they make a loud sound.

385
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Because they can eat this.

386
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
But after that, they become arrogant.

387
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,000
That's why Sabu-chan doesn't clench his fists until Greenpeace.

388
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:59,000
He doesn't clench his fists like this. He clenches his fists like this.

389
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Everyone does that.

390
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
That's right.

391
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Matsumoto-san, you've stepped on the tails of many animals.

392
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Yes.

393
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Which animal has the best reaction?

394
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Which animal has the worst reaction?

395
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
That's a good question.

396
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Have you ever stepped on a dog?

397
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
What?

398
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
A dog's tail?

399
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Of course it's a dog.

400
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I've never stepped on it.

401
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I've stepped on it before.

402
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I've stepped on it from the tail of an unhappy dog.

403
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
There are dogs that are as good as that, right?

404
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Of course.

405
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
That was only a coincidence.

406
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
What kind of reaction did you get when you stepped on a dog?

407
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
A dog doesn't make a sound.

408
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
It's not funny at all.

409
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
It's not something you can say on TV.

410
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
So the reaction is bad, right?

411
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
It's bad.

412
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
It's not funny at all.

413
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
The most interesting reaction was when you stepped on something.

414
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Ah, you're asking about that?

415
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I didn't think of that.

416
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Sorry.

417
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Sorry, sorry.

418
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
What?

419
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
So...

420
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
You didn't react to the dog, right?

421
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Yes, yes.

422
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
You didn't think of it at all, right?

423
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Yes, yes.

424
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
What was the most interesting reaction you got?

425
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Um...

426
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Moo!

427
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Moo?

428
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Moo!

429
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Moo!

430
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Do you know?

431
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
What's a moo?

432
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
It's in my house.

433
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Moo?

434
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Um...

435
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,000
It's somewhere between a horse and a deer.

436
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
It's really weak.

437
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
It can only run away.

438
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
So when you stepped on it, your reaction was good?

439
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
It was good.

440
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
What kind of reaction did you get?

441
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Moo!

442
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Moo!

443
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Moo!

444
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
What do you mean, moo?

445
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Moo!

446
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Moo, right?

447
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Moo!

448
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Really?

449
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
What is it?

450
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
What is it?

451
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
What?

452
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
What is it?

453
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Wait, let's talk!

454
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
What is it?

455
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
What is it?

456
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
What is it?

457
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
When you stepped on it...

458
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
When you stepped on it...

459
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
But they don't understand it.

460
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:16,500
Do you understand?

461
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,000
Yes.

462
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
If it was an easy-to-understand animal,

463
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
they would say,

464
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Oh, so that's how that animal reacts.

465
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Everyone would think about it and laugh.

466
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
But when they say,

467
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
No!

468
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,000
They can't even think of the shape of the object.

469
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
It's like,

470
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Seriously?

471
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
They can't think of it.

472
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:43,000
That's my fault, too.

473
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
So you understand it better.

474
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I've been watching No on TV recently.

475
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
It just so happened.

476
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
That's what happened.

477
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
That's what I wanted to say.

478
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
When I said, No,

479
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,000
they didn't take it as much as I thought they would.

480
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
There aren't many people who know.

481
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I don't know what to do.

482
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
I've recently learned the word,

483
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Todo no tsumari.

484
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I see.

485
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I don't know when I should use it.

486
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I'll teach you how to speak with the correct pronunciation of the word.

487
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
How about this?

488
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Right now,

489
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I'm using the word,

490
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Todo no tsumari,

491
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
to make a short story.

492
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Even if I say it here,

493
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
it's like I'm forcing it.

494
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
It's not natural.

495
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
In the conversation after this,

496
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I'll try to use the word,

497
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Todo no tsumari.

498
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I see.

499
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I don't know when it'll come out.

500
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
The more natural it is,

501
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
the easier it is to understand.

502
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
You just said it in English.

503
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I said it in English.

504
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
You said it in English.

505
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Please use it properly.

506
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I will. I'll use it until the end of today.

507
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
You will?

508
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Yes.

509
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I see.

510
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Everyone, please use it properly.

511
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
This is a question for Matsumoto-san,

512
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
from the Dover Kaikyo O-danbu.

513
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
U-chan Ran-chan's Uchimura-san,

514
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
why are you so white?

515
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
If you have a reason,

516
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
please tell me.

517
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
It's an amazing handwriting, isn't it?

518
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Please use it properly.

519
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Todo no tsumari.

520
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Yes, I understand.

521
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
If you're that white,

522
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
it's not just one reason.

523
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Really?

524
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,000
It's a combination of many situations.

525
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Is that so?

526
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Please explain the situation properly.

527
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
First of all,

528
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
you probably killed a white snake, didn't you?

529
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
You killed a white snake.

530
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Then you ate too many squids.

531
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Then you got too carried away by seeds.

532
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
That's interesting.

533
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
The third one is interesting.

534
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
The third one is interesting.

535
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Todo no tsumari.

536
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Why are you so troubled?

537
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Why are you so troubled?

538
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
It was good just now, wasn't it?

539
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Why didn't you tell me the secret at the end?

540
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Because there was a reaction.

541
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
I was surprised.

542
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
So that's the situation.

543
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Yes.

544
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Todo no tsumari.

545
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Yes, yes.

546
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
It's white.

547
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
I see.

548
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
This is good.

549
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
What?

550
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
You solved two questions in one.

551
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
This is beautiful.

552
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
This is beautiful, isn't it?

553
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
It wasn't like this before.

554
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
It wasn't like this before, wasn't it?

555
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
I thought it would be better if the audience's reaction was better.

556
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
It was good in the beginning.

557
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
It was good in the beginning.

558
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Yes.

559
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
From now on, there will be something like this, right?

560
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Did you talk about scales falling from your eyes?

561
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Did you talk about scales falling from your eyes?

562
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
It's interesting.

563
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
There's a time machine, right?

564
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Yes.

565
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Time machines are absolutely impossible.

566
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,000
What are you talking about? I don't understand at all.

567
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
I'm just talking in order.

568
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Time machines are absolutely impossible to complete.

569
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
I see.

570
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Because it has never happened to a person who has time-slipped.

571
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
What do you mean?

572
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,000
It has never happened to a person who has time-slipped.

573
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Right?

574
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Is there anyone who doesn't understand?

575
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
He explained it in an easy-to-understand manner.

576
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:27,000
For example, if a time machine was made about a thousand years later,

577
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,000
it should be able to meet the person who is currently wearing it on a time machine.

578
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:37,000
But you've never met a person who has time-slipped and has come from the future, right?

579
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:43,000
That means the time machine will never be completed, no matter how many years later.

580
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
I don't understand what you're saying.

581
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
This is an amazing story.

582
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
It's a bit different.

583
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Why does everyone come up to the stage and raise their head?

584
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Maachan! Maachan!

585
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Hama-chan's Maachan! Maachan!

586
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Wait a minute.

587
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Maachan is fine.

588
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
What's with Hama-chan's Maachan?

589
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
That's because I'm thinking about your personality.

590
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
If you come up to the stage and say, Maachan! Maachan!

591
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
and I raise my head, you'll end up looking like this again.

592
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Everyone will end up looking like Matsumoto Takeya.

593
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Maachan! Maachan! Hama-chan's Maachan!
