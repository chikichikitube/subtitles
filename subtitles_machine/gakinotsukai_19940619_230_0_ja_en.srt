1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
June 1984, the rainy season that lasted until yesterday.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
On this day, we are going to have a strange experience.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I'm bored without a job.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Yeah.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
What should I do?

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I can't get a job at all.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Yeah.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I don't have money.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I don't have money.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I'm hungry.

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I'm hungry.

12
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I'm hungry when I don't have to do anything.

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
On the contrary.

14
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm hungry when I don't have money.

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm hungry.

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Let's have lunch here.

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Let's eat at my house.

18
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Let's do that.

19
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
That's the best.

20
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I don't need money.

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I don't have money.

22
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
How much do you have?

23
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
1,000 yen.

24
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
What?

25
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
This is the last money.

26
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Really?

27
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Yeah.

28
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
What should I do?

29
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I only have 1,000 yen.

30
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
You only have 1,000 yen.

31
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
This is a large bento.

32
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
This is a large bento.

33
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
If we eat together, I have two of these.

34
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
You can eat one at a time.

35
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I can eat one at a time.

36
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
That's enough.

37
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Is that enough?

38
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
That's enough.

39
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
This is a large bento.

40
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Yeah.

41
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Thank you very much.

42
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Excuse me.

43
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
This is 470 yen.

44
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Yes.

45
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
This is 480 yen.

46
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
This is 1,000 yen.

47
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Excuse me.

48
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Can you microwave this for me?

49
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm sorry.

50
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The microwave is not working today.

51
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I can't warm it up.

52
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Where can I microwave this?

53
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I don't know.

54
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
You always say that.

55
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
If you can't microwave it at home,

56
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
you can microwave it somewhere else.

57
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I can't eat it.

58
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
This is a large bento.

59
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I don't know.

60
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Ouch.

61
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Good morning.

62
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
What are you two doing here?

63
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I can't microwave a bento.

64
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I can't microwave it.

65
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
What?

66
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
It's a joke.

67
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
It's a joke.

68
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
It's a joke.

69
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I want to microwave it somewhere.

70
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Where should I microwave it?

71
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I don't know.

72
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Look at this.

73
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
What is this?

74
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
There's a map here.

75
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Throw a dart.

76
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Go where it hits.

77
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Let's microwave it.

78
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Okay.

79
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Let's do that.

80
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Here it is.

81
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Itabashiku.

82
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
What?

83
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Itabashiku.

84
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Itabashiku.

85
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Itabashiku.

86
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I see.

87
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
This program is brought to you

88
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
by the sponsor of the program.

89
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Looking for a place to microwave a large bento

90
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
with Yamazaki's suggestion,

91
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
they head to downtown Ichiro Itabashiku.

92
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Itabashiku has a population of 520,000 people.

93
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Where will they go?

94
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Hello.

95
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Look at this.

96
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
We came to Itabashiku.

97
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
We came to Itabashiku.

98
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Either way,

99
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
you have to microwave it.

100
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Okay.

101
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
It's already rotten.

102
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Are you okay?

103
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
It's okay.

104
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
It's a large bento.

105
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Okay.

106
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Let's microwave it again in Itabashiku.

107
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Let's do that.

108
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Okay.

109
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Ouch.

110
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
What?

111
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
What a reaction.

112
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I don't like it.

113
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
It's like you're lighting a cigarette.

114
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
It's cool.

115
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
It's cool.

116
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
It's cool.

117
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
It's cool.

118
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
It's cool.

119
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
It's cool.

120
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Let's go.

121
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Let's go.

122
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
What did you do?

123
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
What did you do?

124
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
What did you do?

125
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
What was that?

126
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
What was that?

127
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
What was that?

128
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
What was that?

129
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I drooled.

130
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I drooled.

131
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Okay.

132
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Nakamaru-cho.

133
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
They are looking for otakus who are going to microwave the bento.

134
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
They are going to Nakamaru-cho in Itabashiku.

135
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I got hit on my leg.

136
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
It hurts.

137
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
It hurts, right?

138
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
It hurts.

139
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
It's bleeding.

140
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
It's not bleeding.

141
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
It's like a black bug.

142
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
It's like a black bug.

143
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
It's like a black bug.

144
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
It's like a black bug.

145
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
It's like a black bug.

146
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
It's bleeding.

147
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I have that kind of thing.

148
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I don't have it.

149
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
The destination that Darts told us is Itabashiku Nakamaru-cho.

150
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
There are 4514 people.

151
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Which otaku are they going to meet?

152
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Hello.

153
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
We are here in Nakamaru-cho.

154
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Where are we?

155
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Where are we?

156
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Where are we?

157
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
We are here in Nakamaru-cho.

158
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Number 17.

159
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
We are here.

160
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
We are here.

161
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
It's getting close.

162
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
This is the last stop.

163
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Thank you.

164
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Where are we going?

165
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Where are we going?

166
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Let's go.

167
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
We are here, right?

168
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
We are here.

169
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
It's an apartment.

170
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Iwatani?

171
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Iwatani apartment.

172
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
One of the houses in Nakamaru-cho is closed.

173
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
What should we do?

174
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
If we run, we will find it.

175
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Hello.

176
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
We are here.

177
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Thank you.

178
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Where are we going?

179
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Where are we going?

180
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
They found the destination.

181
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
They visit the owner of the first floor.

182
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Stop it.

183
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
It's scary.

184
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
It's scary.

185
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
But it was an apartment, so they are in a darts again.

186
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
It's an apartment again.

187
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
One house was chosen from the side of Nakamaru-cho.

188
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I'm not good at riding a bicycle.

189
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
They are in a darts again.

190
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
We are here.

191
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Saito.

192
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Tetsuichiro.

193
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Tetsuichiro.

194
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
This is the third time.

195
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Will they be able to find it this time?

196
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I wonder if Tetsuichiro is here.

197
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Keiichiro.

198
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Tetsuichiro.

199
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Keiichiro.

200
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
This is Keiichiro.

201
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
That's wrong.

202
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
They found it.

203
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Excuse me.

204
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Hello.

205
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Hello.

206
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Excuse me.

207
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I want you to clean the bento.

208
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Is that so?

209
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Is that okay?

210
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
You are a very honest person.

211
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
What do you mean?

212
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:23,000
This is Saito's house in Nakamaru-cho, which was chosen by a darts of 12 million people in Tokyo.

213
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
You are also beautiful.

214
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Don't talk nonsense.

215
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
They found it.

216
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
They found it.

217
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
They found it.

218
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
It's hot.

219
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
It's hot.

220
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Is it hot?

221
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
It's warm.

222
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
It's burnt.

223
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Tetsuichiro.

224
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Keiichiro.

225
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
It's very hot.

226
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
It's very hot.

227
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
We have finished cleaning and eating.

228
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I want to drink cold barley tea.

229
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
How about darts?

230
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Let's do it.

231
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Hello.

232
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
It's been two weeks since I thought about it.

233
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Two weeks.

234
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
The players suddenly became friends.

235
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
What's the problem?

236
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
The darts are swollen.

237
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
If the darts are swollen, the heat will come out of the hole.

238
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
It's coming out.

239
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
The darts are amazing.

240
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Don't be so desperate.

241
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,000
When I had a darts about 41 degrees a few years ago,

242
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I also had a darts about 40 degrees.

243
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Ultra 7 was flying all the time.

244
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Are you serious?

245
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I don't know why Ultra 7 was flying.

246
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Because of the situation at that time.

247
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I think it's natural.

248
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Because the darts are more than 40 degrees.

249
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
It doesn't matter who is flying.

250
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Even if Ultra 7 is flying, it's OK.

251
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
It's OK.

252
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
It's OK.

253
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
It's OK.

254
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
It's strange that it's OK.

255
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
It's strange.

256
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
When an adult man is flying more than 40 degrees, it's dangerous.

257
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Is that so?

258
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Yes.

259
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
There are no seeds.

260
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Is that because of the heat?

261
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Yes.

262
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Isn't it because of the darts?

263
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
What's the problem?

264
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
If you have a darts, you'll be in trouble.

265
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:38,000
If you have a darts, you'll be in trouble.

266
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
The darts are swollen.

267
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
No.

268
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:47,000
My eyes are black, so I can't draw darts on the stage.

269
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
But...

270
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
No, no, no.

271
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
What are you talking about?

272
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
You can't draw darts from the outside.

273
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Don't draw darts from the inside.

274
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
No, no, no.

275
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
What are you talking about?

276
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
What are you talking about?

277
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Stop it.

278
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Don't draw darts from your heels.

279
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
It's the same for otaku.

280
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
It's the same for otaku.

281
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
When the temperature rises, it evaporates.

282
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Simply put.

283
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
It seems to be in a very dangerous state.

284
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
But it's okay because two people can do it.

285
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
It's not a battle between the Japanese and the Japanese.

286
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
That's right.

287
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
The other day...

288
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
When was it?

289
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
The day before the war?

290
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I told you that I gave power to the Iranians.

291
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
The one with the battery connected.

292
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
The one with the battery connected.

293
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
It's not something you can do from then on.

294
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Why?

295
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
The car is in a very bad condition.

296
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
The power was sucked by the Iranians.

297
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
It's not like that.

298
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
When the engine starts, it goes like this.

299
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Really.

300
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
That's because you didn't maintain it properly.

301
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
That's strange.

302
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I did something good.

303
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I did something good.

304
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I told you to go home.

305
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
That's because you want something in return.

306
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
That's because you want something in return.

307
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
You shouldn't do that.

308
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I don't want anything in return.

309
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Wait, wait, wait.

310
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Human beings are in return for everything.

311
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
What are you doing?

312
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
It's completely different from what you said last week.

313
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Wait a minute.

314
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Is there anything you don't want in return?

315
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
What do you want?

316
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Everyone is in return for everything.

317
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Is that so?

318
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
You want to be kind to women because you have a purpose, right?

319
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Tell me what you want.

320
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Wear glasses.

321
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Let's think about it this way.

322
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Wear glasses.

323
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Why do you wear glasses?

324
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Because my eyesight is bad.

325
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Because your eyesight is bad?

326
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
My eyesight is bad, right?

327
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Your eyesight is bad.

328
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
That's why you wear glasses.

329
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
You look better when you wear glasses.

330
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
You expect something in return.

331
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
It's normal for ordinary people to look good.

332
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Ordinary people, right?

333
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Yes.

334
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
It's just about wearing glasses and becoming an ordinary person, right?

335
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Yes, yes, yes.

336
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
It's not about looking back.

337
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Ordinary people.

338
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
It's hard to explain to you with glasses.

339
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
No, no, no.

340
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Glasses are a little different.

341
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
It's your way of thinking now.

342
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
It wasn't glasses, was it?

343
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
How do you get in just by wearing glasses?

344
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
It's annoying.

345
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
That's a lie.

346
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
That's a lie.

347
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
You guys try it.

348
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
What do you do when you say it to an amateur?

349
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
No.

350
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I don't know.

351
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
It's the same with women, right?

352
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,000
They get married and wash dishes.

353
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
They wash dishes.

354
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
They do laundry.

355
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Just do it normally.

356
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
That's what they say.

357
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Right?

358
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
By doing that, they get money from their husbands.

359
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I can't say that they get money from their husbands.

360
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Why?

361
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I don't know.

362
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I don't know either.

363
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
But you don't do anything good.

364
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I think it's strange.

365
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Don't you think so?

366
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Do you get paid the same amount of money as you do good things?

367
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
For example, the money you lost and the money you got.

368
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Which one is more?

369
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
The money I lost is definitely more.

370
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I've never done anything bad to the police.

371
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
But I've done a lot of bad things.

372
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I see. That's what's strange.

373
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
When I was on this show the other day,

374
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I said, this is the most effective,

375
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
and they sent me a box of salampas.

376
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I see.

377
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I said I didn't expect anything in return.

378
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I said, this is the most effective.

379
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:54,000
And they sent me the next box of salampas.

380
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I said, I didn't expect anything in return.

381
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
That's normal.

382
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
That's normal.

383
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
That's normal.

384
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
That's normal.

385
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
But you're doing this with two people.

386
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
What if one of them is sick?

387
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
What?

388
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Can't you manage yourself?

389
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
If you say so.

390
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
If you don't do it right, I'm still doing it.

391
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Did you show your strength?

392
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I haven't shown it to anyone yet.

393
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I'll do it like this.

394
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
There's nothing.

395
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
If I do this once, it'll be amazing.

396
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
But today...

397
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Do it!

398
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
It's really amazing.

399
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Do it.

400
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Everyone will be happy.

401
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I'll do it.

402
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Try bending it.

403
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I'll do it.

404
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Try bending it.

405
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
It'll hurt if you do it like that.

406
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
It'll hurt.

407
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
It'll hurt if you do it like that.

408
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I'm sorry.

409
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Your bones aren't ready yet.

410
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
They are.

411
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
You'll be 31 tomorrow.

412
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I'm ready.

413
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
What?

414
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Not yet.

415
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
If you do that, you won't be able to show your face.

416
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I'll do it like this.

417
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
That's fine.

418
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I'm doing it for my partner.

419
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I'll do it right behind you.

420
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I'll do it.

421
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
What is this?

422
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
It's coming out.

423
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Where?

424
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
It's coming out.

425
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
It's coming out.

426
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
It's coming out.

427
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I can't see it.

428
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I'll stop here for today.

429
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
And this part here.

430
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
It's really like your stomach.

431
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
It's like ice cream.

432
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
It hurts.

433
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
It hurts.

434
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
It hurts.

435
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I told you I have abs.

436
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
It hurts.

437
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Why is Mr. Matsumoto's smile so cute?

438
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
When I see Mr. Matsumoto's smile...

439
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Open it. Open it.

440
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I want to smile with him.

441
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Mr. Matsumoto, who made me look like this.

442
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Please tell me the reason for his cute smile.

443
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Actually, this is...

444
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
This is...

445
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Actually, this is...

446
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
How should I say this?

447
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Originally, there was a meaning to how I was raised.

448
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Originally, there was a teaching that I shouldn't smile.

449
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
From whom?

450
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
From whom?

451
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
From my father-in-law.

452
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
From my father-in-law.

453
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Isn't he your father?

454
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I'll tell you.

455
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I think humans have the most beautiful smiling faces.

456
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Only humans are animals that smile.

457
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
What's that?

458
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Is it because of your husband?

459
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
When you feed him.

460
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
You're laughing?

461
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I'm in Kamogawa Sea World.

462
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
My husband was on TV the other day.

463
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
When I fed him, he was like this.

464
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
When I fed him, he was laughing like this.

465
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
When I fed him, he was laughing like this.

466
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
That's definitely a lie.

467
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
It's true.

468
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
That's gross.

469
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
It's gross, but it's true.

470
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
It's true, right?

471
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
It's true.

472
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Wait, wait, wait.

473
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
What's the next story?

474
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
In animals, only humans and a horse can smile.

475
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I see.

476
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
A horse?

477
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Is that a horse?

478
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Is that a horse? I think it's because of my husband.

479
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Because of your husband?

480
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
But I don't know if it's a horse.

481
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
It's a horse.

482
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
It's a horse.

483
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
It's a horse.

484
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
It's a horse.

485
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
It's a horse.

486
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
How do I say this?

487
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
It's like a raised horse.

488
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
It's not bad.

489
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Let's keep it that way.

490
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Right?

491
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
There are only two types of this.

492
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:41,000
And that smile is also a symbol of humans.

493
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I see.

494
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:47,000
If I say something like this, you might feel uncomfortable.

495
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
To be clear, your smile is dirty.

496
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Your painful smile is...

497
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Don't say painful.

498
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
You say it's cute.

499
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Right?

500
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
For me...

501
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
How many years have we been together?

502
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
It's been 13 or 14 years.

503
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Your smile is disgusting.

504
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
So don't laugh.

505
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Try to smile.

506
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
What does that mean?

507
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Try to smile.

508
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
That's how it is.

509
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Humans don't do that.

510
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
No, no, no.

511
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
That's from the era of hunting.

512
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Try to smile.

513
00:19:52,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Try to smile.

514
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I've been thinking a lot lately.

515
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I'm not good at driving.

516
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Who?

517
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I'm from Tokyo.

518
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
I don't know if I'm from Tokyo or not.

519
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
When I try to turn left,

520
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I keep turning left.

521
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Even though there are 3 or 4 lanes on the left,

522
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
there is only one lane to turn left.

523
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
This lane is like this.

524
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Like this.

525
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Like this.

526
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Wow.

527
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I don't think I can do this once.

528
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
But I don't think you can fix it.

529
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Why?

530
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
You've been like this since we came here.

531
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
No, the first lane on the left turns like this.

532
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
The second lane turns like this.

533
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
The next lane turns like this.

534
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Like this.

535
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Like this.

536
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Like this.

537
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Wow.

538
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
What's that wow?

539
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
It's a god's word.

540
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
It's yellow and tries to stop immediately.

541
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Even though people in Osaka are driving,

542
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
they're like, don't turn red! Don't turn yellow!

543
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
But people in Tokyo are driving like,

544
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
won't it turn yellow?

545
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
I can understand that.

546
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
You can go like this anytime.

547
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Even though you're going, you're pretending you don't know.

548
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
What makes me angry is that

549
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,000
there are cars that are going like this.

550
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
And there are cars that are parking here.

551
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Do you know that they're trying to participate in this traffic?

552
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
If they participate, there's no movie.

553
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Because they want to go home.

554
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
But they're going like this.

555
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
And I'm the ass.

556
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
In this traffic.

557
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
If I go, there won't be any cars for a while.

558
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Get out of the back.

559
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
But you're in front of me!

560
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
That's true.

561
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Why?

562
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
I want to go faster.

563
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
This is all you can do?

564
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I want to go faster.

565
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
I can't hold it in.

566
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
You can wait in my ass.

567
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
You can go as far as you want in my ass.

568
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
You can go backwards too.

569
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Ah, Hirakawa-san.

570
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Forcibly...

571
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Ah, why?

572
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
I don't know why!
