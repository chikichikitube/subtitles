1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The beginning of the story was once again far away.

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:05,500
I was a delivery man at the house's ginkgo garden.

3
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:09,000
When he came, he would definitely come with a really loud voice, singing enka.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
That old man was really fast.

5
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:14,000
He came in about 10 minutes.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
A man's voice.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Huh?

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:16,500
A man's voice.

9
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:17,000
That old man?

10
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:17,500
Yeah.

11
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,000
Kato 52.

12
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Why is your man's voice Kato 52?

13
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
He came with a really loud voice, singing enka.

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
You can tell that he came, right?

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Huh? He didn't sing until the entrance?

16
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
He was like this all the time.

17
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
He didn't stop there?

18
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
He didn't stop until the other person came?

19
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
No, no.

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
That's the end of it.

21
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
When I open the chorus, he'll sing the chorus.

22
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
There are so many mysteries hidden in modern society.

23
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
With his sharp sense of observation and deep insight, he will unravel them.

24
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Hitoshi Matsumoto.

25
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
These are the four points of this test.

26
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Will the truth really be there?

27
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Hitoshi Matsumoto.

28
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
The old man who cuts off modern society.

29
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
This program is brought to you by the following sponsors.

30
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
This is Tsutsuimoto's house.

31
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
It's our staff's house.

32
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
It's just inside the prefecture.

33
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Inside the prefecture.

34
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Yamasaki!

35
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:22,500
Yes.

36
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:23,000
Call me.

37
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Yes.

38
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
This is ***.

39
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Oh, hello.

40
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Yes.

41
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Oh, hello.

42
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Hello.

43
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Well, I'm sorry, but I'd like to make an order.

44
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Yes.

45
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Where are you?

46
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm Yamasaki.

47
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Yes.

48
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Honcho.

49
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Honcho, yes.

50
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Roku no ***.

51
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Roku no ***.

52
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Yes.

53
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
One tanuki soba.

54
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Yes.

55
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
One zaru soba.

56
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Yes.

57
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Thank you.

58
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Yes.

59
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Start.

60
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Yes.

61
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
First of all, whether the verification of coming within 10 minutes will be correct or not.

62
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
That's right.

63
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Well, this is already a flow.

64
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
If you come within 10 minutes, is it similar to Kato?

65
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Yes.

66
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Are you singing a song while you're coming?

67
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Yes.

68
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Even if you open the door, are you still singing?

69
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Yes.

70
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Well, singing a song.

71
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
This and this may be possible.

72
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Yes.

73
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Even if you open the door, are you still singing?

74
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Well, if you say so, it's okay.

75
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Is that so?

76
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Yes.

77
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Now, Mr. Matsumoto.

78
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Yes.

79
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Five minutes have passed.

80
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Five minutes have passed.

81
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Oh, it's coming.

82
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Five minutes left.

83
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I said within 10 minutes, but it won't take 10 minutes.

84
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Oh, is that so?

85
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Yes.

86
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
After all, tanuki soba is.

87
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Yes.

88
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Why?

89
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
It's soba.

90
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
It's the best if it's a party.

91
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
It's something to simmer.

92
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Why?

93
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
It's not simmering.

94
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
What?

95
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
It's not simmering.

96
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
It's not simmering.

97
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
It's terrible.

98
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
It's still the first verification.

99
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
It seems to be lost.

100
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
It's already.

101
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
No, no, no.

102
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I'm trying to stand for seven minutes.

103
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Seven minutes?

104
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
No way.

105
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
It's terrible.

106
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Seven minutes?

107
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Oh, really, seven minutes.

108
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
It's three minutes.

109
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Three minutes.

110
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Yes.

111
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Oh, yes.

112
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
It's strange.

113
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I thought I could go to one and three, but this is one.

114
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Oh, it's coming.

115
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Look at it.

116
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Seven minutes and twenty-eight seconds.

117
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
First, ten minutes.

118
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I'm going to take it off now.

119
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I got the first verification.

120
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Did you get it?

121
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Yes.

122
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
This is zero.

123
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Yes.

124
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Well, the next verification.

125
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
A man who looks like Kato Go.

126
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Yes.

127
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I'll show you Kato Go.

128
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
It doesn't make any sound at all.

129
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Yes, excuse me.

130
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
May I?

131
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Yes.

132
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Excuse me.

133
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
What is this?

134
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Yes, don't do it.

135
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Yes.

136
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Oh.

137
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Yes.

138
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I didn't know Kato Go.

139
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I didn't know Kato Go.

140
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I'm sorry.

141
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Well, eight hundred and ninety-one.

142
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Yes.

143
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Oh, excuse me.

144
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Yes.

145
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I'll give you a hundred yen.

146
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I've never seen it before.

147
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Oh, it's back.

148
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Please give me a hundred yen.

149
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Hey, hey, hey.

150
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
It's messed up.

151
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
It's just the delivery time.

152
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
What is it?

153
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
It's over here.

154
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Hey, hey, hey.

155
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I'm not lying.

156
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Not at all.

157
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Well, even if you open the door,

158
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I'm singing.

159
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Well, it doesn't make any sound.

160
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
It doesn't make any sound at all.

161
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
It's a lie.

162
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
It doesn't make any sound if you sing your nose.

163
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Right, Yamasaki?

164
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I didn't sing at all.

165
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Right?

166
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Yes.

167
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Did it look like Kato Go?

168
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Not at all.

169
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Not at all.

170
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
It doesn't look like Kato Go at all.

171
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
It doesn't look like a man at all.

172
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Hey, I had my face puffy today.

173
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
No, that's not the problem.

174
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Why are you puffy only when I'm singing?

175
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I took the delivery ten times,

176
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
and I've been puffy ten times.

177
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
No, but...

178
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
That's enough.

179
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Only that man can shoot a singing show.

180
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
One hour.

181
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I didn't sing at all.

182
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
You're a champ.

183
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
What are you going to do if you sing like that?

184
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
No, no.

185
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I don't want that man to be a champ.

186
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
What are you going to do if you sing like that?

187
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
If I ask him to deliver one more song, will he come?

188
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I think he'll come.

189
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I know Yamasaki.

190
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I'll do it again.

191
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I'll do it again.

192
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
He'll come for sure this time.

193
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
This time...

194
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I don't think he'll come.

195
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
He's not used to it.

196
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
That's why he's a little depressed.

197
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
He's like a regular customer now.

198
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I know Yamasaki.

199
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
So I can think of a way to make him come while singing.

200
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I'll ask him to bring me a big ball.

201
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Okay.

202
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
It's going to take some time.

203
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
The first shot is 7 minutes and 28 seconds.

204
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
This is a test.

205
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I'm Yamasaki.

206
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Yes.

207
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I'd like to order another Kitsune Udon.

208
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
One Kitsune Udon.

209
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I'd like to order another Kitsune Udon.

210
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Okay.

211
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Okay.

212
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I hung up the phone.

213
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I'll call you later.

214
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Okay.

215
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
What did he say?

216
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
He ordered it right away.

217
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
It's a Kitsune Udon.

218
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Kitsune Udon?

219
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Yes.

220
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Udon is...

221
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I don't think he'll come until I've ordered it.

222
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
At the entrance?

223
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I don't think he'll come.

224
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
It's a stubborn store.

225
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
It's very...

226
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
It's very friendly.

227
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I'd like to see Kato again.

228
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I'd like to see Kato again.

229
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I couldn't see him properly.

230
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,000
It's already been 7 minutes.

231
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
It's slower than before.

232
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:51,000
At that time, the old man was already running through the shopping street.

233
00:06:51,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Will Matsumoto's words really come true?

234
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
He's here.

235
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
It's faster than before.

236
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
It's 7 minutes and 24 seconds.

237
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
It's so fast.

238
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Good morning.

239
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Good morning.

240
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Why isn't he here yet?

241
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Come on in.

242
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Come on in.

243
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Come on in.

244
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
It's a matter of time.

245
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
It's a matter of time.

246
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
It's very early.

247
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I'll wash the dishes.

248
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Do you need a towel?

249
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Do you need a towel?

250
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Do you need a towel?

251
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:00,000
He's making a joke.

252
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
It's the worst.

253
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
It's the worst.

254
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
It's the worst.

255
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
You can't hear the singing voice, can you?

256
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I can't hear it at all.

257
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
What is it?

258
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
It's that guy.

259
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
What?

260
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
It's that guy.

261
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
It's that guy.

262
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Ladies and gentlemen.

263
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Good morning.

264
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Once again, Mr. Matsumoto has lied to us.

265
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Well...

266
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Today, Mr. Demaeno went to see a doctor, didn't he?

267
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Yes, of course he did.

268
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Yes.

269
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Mr. Kato 52 is a man.

270
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
That's why.

271
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
There is a difference in personal taste.

272
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
You look like a pot.

273
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Do you think Mr. Kato 52 is a man?

274
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Of course I do.

275
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Even if you look like this?

276
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
That's because I think you're a man.

277
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:07,000
If there are people who think you're cool, I think you're cool.

278
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
This is a personal taste.

279
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I think you're 15 points.

280
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Is that so?

281
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Why are you making a serious face?

282
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
That's fine.

283
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
That's fine.

284
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,000
On the way here, he was singing a song.

285
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
It was very quiet.

286
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
That's the worst.

287
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
That's why...

288
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I'm sorry, but you're sorry, too.

289
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Why am I sorry?

290
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Why am I sorry?

291
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I don't lie.

292
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
No, but everything was a lie.

293
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
If you don't say that, everything I've said so far will be a lie.

294
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
It's a lie.

295
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
It's a lie.

296
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Kappa hikari.

297
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Kappa is that kind of thing.

298
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I've been told this since elementary school.

299
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
There's a kappa in the bathroom.

300
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
When I came home, I told you about the time.

301
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:16,700
There was a monster of the

302
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:22,700
And then he said, shpo shpo shpo, shpo shpo shpo, and then he said, akka!

303
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:26,700
And then he said he wouldn't come out and ran away.

304
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:29,700
Hey, that's a lie!

305
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,700
It's a lie!

306
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,700
You're living on lies!

307
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:37,700
What kind of crying dog does he have?

308
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:38,700
I'll ask you this.

309
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,700
What kind of crying?

310
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,700
He says, nyan!

311
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:44,700
No, this is real. This is real.

312
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:48,700
No, but I've seen a dog do this.

313
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:50,700
No, this is real. This is real.

314
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,700
This is real.

315
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:53,700
No, this is real.

316
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,700
I don't say that much.

317
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:56,700
This is real.

318
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,700
He does this.

319
00:10:58,700 --> 00:10:59,700
That's impossible.

320
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:00,700
No, he really does this.

321
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:01,700
Definitely.

322
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:02,700
No, that's impossible.

323
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:03,700
What does he do?

324
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:04,700
What?

325
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:05,700
Nyan?

326
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:06,700
There's a dog that says, nyan!

327
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,700
It's a little strange.

328
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:10,700
It's a little strange from the beginning.

329
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,700
Geez.

330
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:13,700
Otama.

331
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:14,700
Otama family.

332
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:15,700
Otama family.

333
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:16,700
Stopping the car.

334
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:17,700
Stopping the car.

335
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:18,700
The delivery man.

336
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:19,700
The delivery man is here.

337
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,700
It's all crumbling.

338
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:22,700
It's not crumbling.

339
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,700
If there's anything, please tell me.

340
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:25,700
Shall we?

341
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:27,700
There's Chirimen Jako, right?

342
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:28,700
Yes, yes.

343
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:29,700
Chirimen Jako.

344
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:30,700
Do you know Chirimen Jako?

345
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:32,700
I know it.

346
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:36,700
There was a little crab in there.

347
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,700
Can I say that?

348
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,700
Yes.

349
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,700
There is.

350
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,700
There is.

351
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:46,700
Everyone says there is.

352
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:48,700
Do you know udon?

353
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:49,700
I know it.

354
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:50,700
Udon.

355
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:51,700
Do you know udon?

356
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:53,700
There's only one soba in the udon.

357
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,700
There is.

358
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:58,700
There is.

359
00:11:58,700 --> 00:11:59,700
I don't have it.

360
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:00,700
What is that?

361
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:03,700
What are you talking about?

362
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:06,700
It's not a verification or anything.

363
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:11,700
In the udon restaurant, there is a shop that shows you kneading it through the glass.

364
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,700
Yes, there is.

365
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:14,700
There is, right?

366
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:15,700
There is.

367
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,700
There is a shop that shows you naked in the water.

368
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:18,700
I don't have it.

369
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:23,700
Old man, come here.

370
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:27,700
First of all, make soba.

371
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:30,700
Why are you doing this?

372
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:32,700
There is no way.

373
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:38,700
There is no way.

374
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:39,700
Mr. Matsumoto.

375
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:40,700
Yes.

376
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:41,700
What is it?

377
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:44,700
This is for you.

378
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,700
They made it by hand.

379
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:50,700
They delivered it to the site today.

380
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:51,700
Hitoshi Love.

381
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:54,700
They gave me a letter.

382
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:56,700
Dear Matsumoto Hitoshi.

383
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:59,700
I always meet you at work or in private,

384
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:02,700
but this is the first time I'm sending you a letter.

385
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,700
I'm a little embarrassed.

386
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,700
Do you know what day it is today?

387
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:09,700
Well, I'm giving you the chocolate, so I'm sure you know.

388
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:15,700
But today is a special day for Akko.

389
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:19,700
Today is a special day to confess your love.

390
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:24,700
Everyone in the entertainment world thinks of me as a little scary lady.

391
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:26,700
That's not true.

392
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,700
It's not a little scary.

393
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:31,700
You know the real me, don't you?

394
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:34,700
I don't know what you're writing anymore.

395
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:37,700
I'll confess my love to you.

396
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:42,700
I love you.

397
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:45,700
Please answer me soon.

398
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,700
I'm serious.

399
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,700
I'll call you again.

400
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:53,700
Akiko Wada.

401
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:54,700
Wow.

402
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:57,700
What is this?

403
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:59,700
Hitoshi Love.

404
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,700
I haven't been in touch with you lately.

405
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:02,700
I'm glad.

406
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:03,700
This is bad.

407
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:08,700
If you receive this, you'll definitely write to me.

408
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:13,700
I thought you were a person I'd be happy with.

409
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:15,700
What do you mean?

410
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:18,700
Well...

411
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:20,700
You're really young.

412
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:21,700
That's right.

413
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:22,700
Do you have a boyfriend?

414
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:23,700
Do you like her?

415
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:24,700
That's right.

416
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:25,700
I see.

417
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:53,700
Send her to me.

418
00:14:53,700 --> 00:15:00,700
I'm scared.

419
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:03,700
You scared me.

420
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,700
What is this?

421
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:07,700
She brought it to me.

422
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:09,700
This is bad.

423
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:12,700
Please answer me.

424
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:13,700
You're busy, aren't you?

425
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:21,700
Is it okay for you to die like this?

426
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:25,700
My hair is shaking.

427
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,700
Why are you sweating so much?

428
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:29,700
I was really surprised.

429
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,700
I was surprised when you hit me.

430
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:38,700
I feel like I'm in the Yakuza.

431
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:39,700
Thank you very much.

432
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:42,700
Why didn't you answer me?

433
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:44,700
He found out.

434
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:49,700
Why are you sweating so much?

435
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:53,700
Because you're saying the opposite of what you think.

436
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:55,700
Don't you remember when you came to my house the other day?

437
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:57,700
You really liked me.

438
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:00,700
I'm sorry you're married.

439
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:03,700
You should have known each other sooner.

440
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:09,700
He's a Neuro.

441
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,700
That's weird.

442
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:19,700
That's weird.

443
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:25,700
What's wrong with you?

444
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:26,700
I'm scared.

445
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,700
Have you calmed down?

446
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:30,700
I haven't calmed down yet.

447
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:33,700
I want to go to the post office and forget about it.

448
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:34,700
Let's go to the post office.

449
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:39,700
Can I?

450
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:44,700
What do you think when you say the word, Matsumoto Hitoshi?

451
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:45,700
Have you ever said the word?

452
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,700
No.

453
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,700
You haven't.

454
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:51,700
You never say the word Matsumoto.

455
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:52,700
No, I haven't.

456
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:56,700
But when you say it in a brave way...

457
00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:00,700
He's a moron.

458
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:04,700
When you say it in a brave way, it comes out.

459
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:07,700
Like this?

460
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:10,700
Courage? The energy to go towards something?

461
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,700
Stamina? Effort?

462
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,700
And then, you pull a thing like this and write,

463
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,700
Like Hitoshi Matsumoto,

464
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:19,700
It's written, Koto.

465
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:21,700
Ah, it's Koto.

466
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:24,700
There's a point here?

467
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:26,700
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

468
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,200
Even if you open up Yuuki's part?

469
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,700
And if there's a point where you go backwards,

470
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:33,700
Bring it over here.

471
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:37,200
Matsumoto Hitoshi is the opposite of Dame Ningen.

472
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,200
Eh? Dame Ningen is the opposite of Matsumoto Hitoshi?

473
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,200
What's that?

474
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,200
Ah, there's no time.

475
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,200
Ah, wait.

476
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,200
There's only two lines left.

477
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,200
Ah, I can't do this anymore.

478
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,200
The break has started.

479
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,200
Okay, let's watch it.

480
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,200
Ah, I can't do this anymore.

481
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,200
The break has started.

482
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,200
Okay, let's watch it.

483
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,200
What's going on?

484
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,200
The break has started?

485
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,200
Kanpei-san, you're here!

486
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,200
You're here!

487
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,200
You made it in time!

488
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,200
It's only 24 hours.

489
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,200
What? You're looking at Yuuki's part?

490
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,200
Yes.

491
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,200
You're slow.

492
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,200
Yuukan.

493
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,200
Yuuki, Yuukan.

494
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,200
Kaki.

495
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,200
Yuuki.

496
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,200
Which Yuuki?

497
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,200
Yuuki.

498
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,200
You're Yuuki Kagobutsu's Yuuki, aren't you?

499
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,200
You're the only one left, so I don't know!

500
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,200
Who's Yuuki Kagobutsu?

501
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,200
Which Yuuki?

502
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,200
This Yuuki?

503
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,200
That's right.

504
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,200
Isn't it this Isamuuki?

505
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,200
You're not afraid of anything.

506
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,200
You have a strong feeling.

507
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,200
You have a strong feeling.

508
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,200
That's right.

509
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,200
That's right.

510
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,200
That's right.

511
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,200
That's why this is strange.

512
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,200
What year is this?

513
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,200
This kind of thing changes a lot.

514
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,200
It changes, but the basics don't change.

515
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,200
Even if it increases, it doesn't decrease.

516
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,200
No, it's on the old one.

517
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,200
I wonder if you hit it.

518
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,200
Ah, this isn't good.

519
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,200
What's not good?

520
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,200
It's 2060 yen.

521
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,200
Isn't it more of an Aizou version?

522
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:31,200
Whose Aizou version is it?

523
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:37,200
I can tell if it's a record or something.

524
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,200
Okay, another lie.

525
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,200
I've been pooping since I've pooped.

526
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,200
I've been pooping since I've pooped.

527
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,200
And there's poop on my pants.

528
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,200
What should I do?

529
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:55,200
I'm 19 years old.

530
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,200
First of all, there's poop on my pants.

531
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,200
You're an experienced person.

532
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,200
Of course.

533
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,200
Because I'm the main one.

534
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,200
What?

535
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,200
There's poop on my pants.

536
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,200
Everyone get together and do something.

537
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,200
He's the sub.

538
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,200
I'm the main one.

539
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,200
You're the main one.

540
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,200
I'm the main one.

541
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,200
I'm sorry.

542
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:21,200
First of all, throw away all the pants you have.

543
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,200
Why?

544
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:25,200
Because all the pants you have now have poop on them.

545
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,200
But if I wash them...

546
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,200
You can't get rid of the poop even if you wash them.

547
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:31,200
Don't lick the poop.

548
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,200
I didn't lick it.

549
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,200
I shouldn't have licked it.

550
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:40,200
To be clear, there's no way you can't get rid of the poop.

551
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,200
Everyone has it.

552
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,200
Everyone has it.

553
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,200
I'm sorry.

554
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,200
Everyone has it.

555
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,200
You?

556
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,200
No, no, no.

557
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,200
No, no, no.

558
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,200
Everyone...

559
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:55,200
All mankind...

560
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,200
Say it again.

561
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:01,200
I apologized as a representative of all mankind.

562
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,200
I'm sorry.

563
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,200
If you don't apologize...

564
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,200
That's why there's poop on your pants.

565
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,200
There's no poop on it.

566
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,200
No, no, no.

567
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,200
That's enough.

568
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,200
You don't have to pay attention to it.

569
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,200
I didn't pay attention to it.

570
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,200
It's natural.

571
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,200
There's poop on it.

572
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,200
When you have a stomachache, when you fart, there's poop on it, right?

573
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:27,200
There's no poop on it.

574
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,200
You're a fool.

575
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,200
I've never done it that way.

576
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,200
I've done it the right way.

577
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:35,200
I've done it the right way.

578
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,200
What do you mean the right way?

579
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,200
That's why there's poop on it.

580
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,200
But you haven't taken it all out.

581
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,200
What do you mean the right way?

582
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,200
You left a little bit.

583
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:48,200
You blew it once and it came out.

584
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,200
It's not a residue, but...

585
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,200
You were walking around like Zanbaba.

586
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:58,200
Your butt came out, didn't it?

587
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,200
Hey, hey, hey.

588
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:03,200
Okamoto, call a lawyer.

589
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,200
If you sue me, you can win.

590
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:09,200
Let's fight in court.

591
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:14,200
Call a lawyer.

592
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:17,200
I had a date the other day.

593
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,200
I'm a man.

594
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:23,200
I had a date the other day and got along well with that woman.

595
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,200
We're starting to talk about marriage.

596
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,200
But before that, there's one thing I have to confess.

597
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:31,200
I'm Katsura.

598
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,200
That's good.

599
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,200
How can I confess without hurting her?

600
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,200
That's a good thing.

601
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:41,200
How can I make her accept me without hurting her?

602
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:45,200
I think it's best to make it look like an accident.

603
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,200
Even if it's an accident?

604
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,200
Yes.

605
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:51,200
So, for example, the low part of the ceiling...

606
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,200
That's it, that's it, that's it, that's it.

607
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,200
That's not funny.

608
00:22:56,200 --> 00:23:00,200
It's too beautiful.

609
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,200
That's nothing.

610
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,200
That's no good.

611
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,200
That's difficult.

612
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:09,200
If you're going to get married, you'll have to stop at some point.

613
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,200
Yes, yes, yes.

614
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:14,200
Where should I leave you in the morning?

615
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:17,200
That's obvious.

616
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,200
That's shocking.

617
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,200
When I saw it.

618
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,200
I wonder.

619
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,200
What kind of reaction should I make pretending to sleep?

620
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,200
No, no, that's you.

621
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,200
Because you don't know which one is your girlfriend.

622
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,200
What?

623
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,200
What?

624
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,200
It's going to be as if you're putting a lid on it again.

625
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,200
Is there such a thing as a lid?

626
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:41,200
It's just one side.

627
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,200
There's no gap between me and her.

628
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,200
What would you do if you were naked?

629
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,200
What if you were wearing a veil?

630
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:51,200
After all, there's nothing you can do about it.

631
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,200
What is it?

632
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:56,200
Put animals on it.

633
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,200
As it is.

634
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,200
You can't put animals on it.

635
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:03,200
You have a lot of things to do.

636
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,200
You have to cover it up.

637
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:10,200
Even if you don't cover it up, there are animals that do it properly.

638
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:13,200
Put it on the head.

639
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,200
That's.

640
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,200
What?

641
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,200
What?

642
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,200
What is it?

643
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:30,200
