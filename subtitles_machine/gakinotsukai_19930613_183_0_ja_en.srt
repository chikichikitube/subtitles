1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
After this, it's downtown's Waki no Tsukai Yara-hen.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
This is Wada-ben.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
It's Waki no Tsukai Yara-hen's Chikiriki!

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Matsumoto, Kasutaya, and Hamada haven't borrowed 3,000 yen yet!

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
How many points will Wada-ben get?

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Now, you've finally returned 3,000 yen.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
That's not what I'm talking about.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I haven't borrowed it yet!

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
So, what should we do?

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
So, today, we're going to settle this game.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Today, Wada-ben has come as a guest.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Today, we're going to talk about TV.

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
We're going to talk about TV.

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
In this talk, we're going to, for example,

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Wada-ben, we're going to touch his body.

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
We're going to hit him.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
We're going to score points.

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,000
First of all, the easiest thing to hit is here.

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
With the back of the sword.

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'll give you one point.

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
That's easy.

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
This is really easy.

23
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
After all, the head is important.

24
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
It's important, so I think it's okay to do this.

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
How about pulling his hair?

26
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
That's a gold card.

27
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
This is one point.

28
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'll give you 30 points for the hip next to it.

29
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Well, I'm doing this.

30
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,000
How about this?

31
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I'm a little angry.

32
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
It's 10 points.

33
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Well, it's in the middle of a talk.

34
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Wada-ben is not here yet.

35
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Ben?

36
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Try again.

37
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
It's a guy named Ben.

38
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I'm a little angry.

39
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
That means, this is also a point.

40
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I'll give you 30 points.

41
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I'll give you 30 points.

42
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
What happens if you go from behind?

43
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
What happens if you go to the nose hook?

44
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
This is a bonus.

45
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I'll give you 50 points.

46
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Is there such a talk?

47
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
If you start a talk suddenly, it will be messed up.

48
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
In the first half, I had a normal talk.

49
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
While drawing out the charm of Mr. Wada-ben.

50
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Three minutes from where you are.

51
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I think there's tea.

52
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I'll drink it up.

53
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I'll drink it up all at once.

54
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Three minutes from the time you drink it up.

55
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I'll give you a bonus in the meantime.

56
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
On the contrary, you can't touch it until then.

57
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
There's something I want to say.

58
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I'll say something I can't help it.

59
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I'll be upset.

60
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
If you hit it while you're drinking it up, you'll get minus points.

61
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:55,000
It's still a start from minus.

62
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Good evening, everyone.

63
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Good evening.

64
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I'm serious today.

65
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
That's right.

66
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Today, we have a guest, Mr. Wada-ben.

67
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I'm going to turn off the TV now.

68
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
That's right.

69
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I think we can have a meaningful conversation.

70
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Is that so?

71
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Let's get started.

72
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Mr. Wada-ben, please.

73
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I'll call you Wada-ben.

74
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
You can call me Wada-poop.

75
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
It's the same thing.

76
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I see.

77
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I think your clothes are different today.

78
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Is that so?

79
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
What do you mean?

80
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Shouldn't you wear a gown or a jacket?

81
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Is that so?

82
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Downtown.

83
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
No, no, no.

84
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Downtown is fine.

85
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I got hit.

86
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I got a high score.

87
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Today, even if I say I'll turn off the TV,

88
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Let's talk roughly.

89
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
You have to turn it off.

90
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Oh, really?

91
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I'll turn off the TV.

92
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Then your clothes will be different again.

93
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Why is that?

94
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
You have to dress up like you're going to turn it off.

95
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I don't understand the show at all.

96
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I see.

97
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Here you go.

98
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
You'd better turn it off.

99
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Oh, really?

100
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I don't want to see your face.

101
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
You're fast.

102
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
It's important to be funny.

103
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
That's right.

104
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
If you're serious, you can't help it.

105
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I see.

106
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I can't help it.

107
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
That's right.

108
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I don't know if it's funny or not.

109
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Why is that?

110
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I can't help it.

111
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
But...

112
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I'll turn off the TV.

113
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I'll turn off the TV.

114
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
There's a masterpiece like this.

115
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I'll turn off the TV.

116
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I'll turn off the TV.

117
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I'll turn it off.

118
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I'll turn off the TV.

119
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:12,000
There was nothing the other day.

120
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I see.

121
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
How old are you now?

122
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I was born in 1996.

123
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
How old are you?

124
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I was born in 1956.

125
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
It was a little more broken.

126
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I quit.

127
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I write it as a thought of giving up.

128
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
You don't know the principle of giving up?

129
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
What is it?

130
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Well, whatever.

131
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
It's a poop.

132
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
It's not a poop.

133
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I took my son's hand and walked in the hallway.

134
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
It's called an aging phenomenon.

135
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
At that time...

136
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
At that time...

137
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
From the other side...

138
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Do you know Morimi-chan?

139
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
It's Mori Mitsuko-san.

140
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
She appeared.

141
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
She said this.

142
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Oh!

143
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
A big fart and a small fart appeared.

144
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
You bastard!

145
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
How was it when you were young? Were you popular?

146
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Let's be young.

147
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Let's be young.

148
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
What did you do when you were young?

149
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
This is...

150
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Even if you're young, even if you're old, it's the same.

151
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Is that so?

152
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
What did you do on TV?

153
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I want to make a drama on TV.

154
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Who are you using now?

155
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Everyone's dead.

156
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Everyone's dead.

157
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I see.

158
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
It's called Cinderella.

159
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Is there a dead person?

160
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Even if you do that, it's not exciting.

161
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I'll do a drama.

162
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Please do it.

163
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I want to be encouraged by a proper person.

164
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
If you encourage me...

165
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
You're encouraging me.

166
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I'll encourage you.

167
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
The result came out.

168
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I got this kind of score.

169
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I got the final score.

170
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Let's go.

171
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
What's the score?

172
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
158.

173
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
249.

174
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Are you kidding me?

175
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
You got 249 points.

176
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
That's too much.

177
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Hello.

178
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Mr. Hamada.

179
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Everyone's smiling at me.

180
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I'm shining.

181
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I'm smiling like this.

182
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
You're laughing a lot.

183
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I was talking about the punishment game in the dressing room.

184
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
There's nothing good about it.

185
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I've done a lot of things.

186
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
There's no doubt that you're going to play a punishment game.

187
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Why?

188
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
This time, really.

189
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
So I'm going to talk about how to extend your vision to the outside world.

190
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
You can't go to America.

191
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
You can't go there.

192
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I was talking about the Statue of Liberty.

193
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
You're going to fly from the helicopter.

194
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
You're going to run into a huge hedgehog.

195
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Don't copy me.

196
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Don't copy me.

197
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
That's not good.

198
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
The Statue of Liberty is a symbol of America.

199
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
If you hit it...

200
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
If you hit it, it's going to be hard.

201
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Amazon.

202
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Amazon is a one-way trip.

203
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Amazon is a one-way trip.

204
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I'm not alone.

205
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Amazon is a one-way trip.

206
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
What are you going to do in Amazon?

207
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I'll have lunch in one hand.

208
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
You're going to have lunch somewhere?

209
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
No.

210
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I don't know what's going to come out.

211
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I'll be wearing a pair of socks with a collar.

212
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I'll be wearing a pair of socks with a collar.

213
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I'll be wearing a pair of socks with a collar.

214
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
You're going to walk.

215
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I was talking about this.

216
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I'm going to wear a penis.

217
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I'm going to be the president of a company.

218
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
What are you doing?

219
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
President of a company.

220
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Let's think about it.

221
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
If you don't think about the confrontation, you'll be punished.

222
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Confrontation is not a time to fight.

223
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
That's what you're going to do, right?

224
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
That's what you're going to do, right?

225
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
That's right.

226
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
That's definitely right.

227
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
That's definitely right.

228
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I understand.

229
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I'll think about the punishment.

230
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Do something dangerous.

231
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Why?

232
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Why?

233
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Why don't you ask?

234
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,000
There's that thing.

235
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Do something like this.

236
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Put your head on a plate.

237
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Do something like this.

238
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I'll die.

239
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
First of all, it's okay.

240
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Why is it okay?

241
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
It's three bullets.

242
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Is that so?

243
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
It's better than being targeted with one point.

244
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Are you stupid?

245
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
It's three bullets.

246
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
The bullets are flying all over you.

247
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I'm going to do something good.

248
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
What are you talking about?

249
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Who are you?

250
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Who said that?

251
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Daimonjiyaki.

252
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
There's Daimonjiyaki, right?

253
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
In Kyoto.

254
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
In the scene of Daimonjiyaki.

255
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
You become a Hidaruma.

256
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Go to the top of the table and die as a dog.

257
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
If you do that, you'll lose your partner.

258
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
It's okay.

259
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
What's okay?

260
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
You become a Hidaruma.

261
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Let's think about various conditions.

262
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
What kind of conditions?

263
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
You become a Hidaruma.

264
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Let's think about various conditions.

265
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
It's okay.

266
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Why is that?

267
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
It's okay.

268
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
If you come to the left, it's okay.

269
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
What's okay?

270
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
It's not okay.

271
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
It's so good.

272
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
If I do it, I'll do it.

273
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
No, it's not okay.

274
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
You've never done anything scary, have you?

275
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I'm not scared of my life.

276
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
That's right.

277
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
But it's scary.

278
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
You'll get hurt.

279
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Where do you want to get hurt?

280
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Why?

281
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Do you want to get hurt?

282
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
You're a fool.

283
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I'm a fool.

284
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Where do you want to get hurt?

285
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
What if your wings fly away?

286
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
That's your way of doing it.

287
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I'm the one who moves it.

288
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
It's not okay.

289
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
You'll get hurt.

290
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
It's scary.

291
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
It's scary.

292
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
You're just doing this.

293
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
You're just doing this.

294
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
You're just doing this.

295
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,000
You don't know how scary it is, do you?

296
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:24,000
When I'm in the car, I can see the entertainer.

297
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Today or yesterday.

298
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:31,000
When I'm waiting for a signal, the person who's stopped is smiling at me.

299
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I don't know if he's smiling at me because he knows me.

300
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:46,000
When I was going to CX yesterday, when I stopped at the signal, everyone was smiling at me.

301
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
They're looking at me.

302
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
They're smiling at the car itself.

303
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I'm definitely in the car.

304
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
They're looking at me.

305
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
They're smiling at me.

306
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I'm wondering if they're looking at me.

307
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
They're looking at me so much.

308
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I'm definitely in the car.

309
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
It's not my fault.

310
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
It's not my fault.

311
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:16,000
It's my car.

312
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I got off at CX and looked at it.

313
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Nothing was written on it.

314
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I was shopping at a convenience store before.

315
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,000
The old man was smiling at me.

316
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I thought he was smiling at Matsumoto.

317
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:43,000
But when I got home, he had lipstick on his lips.

318
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I was like, I can't do this.

319
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
It's your fault.

320
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Wipe it off properly.

321
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
That's not good.

322
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:02,000
At that time, I did it in the dark.

323
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I did it in the dark.

324
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,000
What are you doing?

325
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,000
It's not Rumiko and Kenya.

326
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I put on my shoes and closed the door.

327
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
You're a bad guy.

328
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Why did you do it?

329
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
That's right.

330
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Why did you do it?

331
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
It's like you're planning something.

332
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I'm planning something.

333
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
But I close the door and turn off the lights.

334
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
At that time, it's a half laugh, right?

335
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
It's a half laugh.

336
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
After that...

337
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
It's not Rumiko and Kenya.

338
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I pass it like this.

339
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Why do you do that?

340
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I turn the woman behind me and pull out my hand.

341
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I'll do it.

342
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I stand up like this.

343
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Not yet.

344
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I like it.

345
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I do it twice.

346
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
After that, I lie down.

347
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I lie down.

348
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:15,000
After that, I lie down.

349
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
After that, I bring a tarai.

350
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Why?

351
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
That's good.

352
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
It's dark.

353
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
After that, it's over, right?

354
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I'll send it as it is.

355
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I'll send it.

356
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
But it's always there.

357
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
It's always there.

358
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
It's amazing that it's left until the end.

359
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Are you licking all over the place?

360
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I don't lick that much.

361
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
If you don't like it that much, lick it to some extent.

362
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I don't like it.

363
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
If you don't like it, go out.

364
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,000
You licked it, too.

365
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I thought I'd go to the convenience store.

366
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I thought it was me.

367
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I went home and looked in the mirror.

368
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
It's here.

369
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I laughed.

370
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,000
You have to check it.

371
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
You have to be careful.

372
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
A woman's lipstick.

373
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
That's not good.

374
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
That's not good.

375
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
That's really not good.

376
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
There's lipstick everywhere.

377
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
There's no choice.

378
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
It's around here.

379
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
It's here on the T-shirt.

380
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
That's right.

381
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
It's here.

382
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
This is...

383
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
If you put it there, it's all over the place.

384
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I do it like this.

385
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I do it like this.

386
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:54,000
It feels good on this side, too.

387
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
The T-shirt is all over the place.

388
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I don't have enough training.

389
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:10,000
If you press the place near the wrist of the palm, what comes out?

390
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
What is it?

391
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
It's coming out.

392
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Isn't it meat?

393
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
It's round.

394
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
It's coming out.

395
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I have two.

396
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
What is this?

397
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I used to say the number of children I could have.

398
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Really?

399
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I used to say that.

400
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Really?

401
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I have two.

402
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I have two.

403
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
You have two?

404
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Yes.

405
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I see.

406
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
What is this?

407
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Let me press it more.

408
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
It hurts.

409
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
It hurts.

410
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I'm sorry.

411
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I don't like it.

412
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Really?

413
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I'm sorry.

414
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
It hurts twice as much as before.

415
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
It hurts.

416
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
What is this?

417
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
This is probably...

418
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
What is it?

419
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:16,000
It's like an abnormal food.

420
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,000
In the end.

421
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:28,000
When I really can't stand it anymore, I think I'm going to eat this.

422
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I have two.

423
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:36,000
The right one tastes like soy sauce.

424
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:42,000
The left one tastes like miso.

425
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,000
The one with three tastes like curry.

426
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Well, what should I do?

427
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
What should I do?

428
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
What should I do?

429
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Chashu.

430
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
What is this?

431
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
What is this?

432
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Chashu.

433
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I don't know yet.

434
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
This guy.

435
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Chashu.

436
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
What should I do?

437
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Chashu.

438
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I often see flies and bugs on the train and bus, but can they go home?

439
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I don't know.

440
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I don't worry about my parents and siblings.

441
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I don't know.

442
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I don't think they can go home, but they are on the train to go home.

443
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Really?

444
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
They don't take the train to go home.

445
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
They take the train to go home.

446
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
They can't take the train to go home?

447
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
They can't take the train to go home.

448
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Why?

449
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
They have a lot of power.

450
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
They can fly.

451
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
They are tired to go home.

452
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
They are tired to go home.

453
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
They stay somewhere.

454
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Yes.

455
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
There are flies in the studio, right?

456
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
There are.

457
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Those flies are amazing.

458
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Why?

459
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
There are a lot of them.

460
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Are you visiting the studio?

461
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Visiting the studio.

462
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Visiting the studio.

463
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Visiting the studio.

464
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
There are a lot of them.

465
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Well, let's go home.

466
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
It's hot.

467
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
It's just a punishment game.

468
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
You said you were going to Thailand.

469
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Thailand.

470
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Thai kickboxing.

471
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Thai kickboxing.

472
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:31,000
They go into the ring.

473
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
They go into the ring.

474
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
One of them is going up.

475
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
One of them is going up.

476
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
I don't know.

477
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
E!

478
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
What?

479
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
It's a new joke.

480
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
E!

481
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
It's a lie.

482
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
There is E.

483
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
There is a big E.

484
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
They sit on it.

485
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
They drink tea.

486
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
It's hard to find it.

487
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
It's a lie.

488
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Is it?

489
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
They want to find an imaginary animal.

490
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
It's impossible.

491
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:13,000
There are animals that haven't been found yet.

492
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
They don't think they are animals.

493
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
They don't know they are animals.

494
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
There are animals.

495
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
I wonder.

496
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
There are definitely animals.

497
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:25,000
For example, if you say a tiger, everyone thinks it's a tiger, right?

498
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,000
I wonder if that island is also an animal.

499
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
They live in the same place as the tiger.

500
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,000
It's an island that's trying to be protected by the tiger.

501
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I don't know if that's still an animal.

502
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
That's why the tiger doesn't look at humans.

503
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Please stop the movie.

504
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:49,000
I'm sorry about that island.
