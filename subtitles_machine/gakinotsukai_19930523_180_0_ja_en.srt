1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Well, today, I was watching a comic book.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Oh, you're going to give up.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Why?

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Because I didn't go yesterday.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Did you catch a cold?

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Yes, I caught a cold.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Why didn't you stay in your seat?

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I couldn't talk because I was in my seat.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I see.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I couldn't talk because I was in my seat.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Don't do that.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
So, this program started on October 3, 2006.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Is that including the New Year's Day?

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
That's right.

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:53,000
What you're going to see today is the children's phone call room on November 28, 2006.

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
You've been doing it all the time, haven't you?

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Yes.

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
But there's no more content.

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
This is the last episode of the comic book.

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
That's right.

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Most of our content is gone.

22
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
It's gone.

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
On the way here, you said,

24
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
What should I do?

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
On the way here, I came here without thinking.

26
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I came here and explained to Hamada how to do it.

27
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
We did it together in the dressing room.

28
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
We did it together once or twice.

29
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
But it was a mess.

30
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
You're really a genius.

31
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
What is it?

32
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
You can do it right away in the comic book.

33
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
You're the greatest comedian of this century.

34
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
There's no doubt about it.

35
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Shut up.

36
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
This is the last story.

37
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I've done it anywhere.

38
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I've done it for the first time.

39
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I've only done it once.

40
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I'll never do it again.

41
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
People who watch TV will say,

42
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Why don't you do it when you've done it so many times?

43
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Why did you do it so many times?

44
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Why don't you do it?

45
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm lying.

46
00:01:48,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I'm not lying.

47
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I'm grateful for your good reputation.

48
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I don't usually appear on TV these days.

49
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
It's not a very interesting TV.

50
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
It's on the movie now.

51
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I'm more interested in the radio.

52
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I talk to children on the radio during the day.

53
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I talk to children.

54
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I can't hear it.

55
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I can't understand anything my family told me.

56
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I talked with my parents.

57
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
They can't hear it.

58
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
It's hard to understand.

59
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Let me call my friend.

60
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Hello.

61
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Yes.

62
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
meter

63
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I'm looking for you on the phone.

64
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
That's what I hear sometimes.

65
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Yes.

66
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Hello.

67
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Yes.

68
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Last Sunday morning,

69
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Hello?

70
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Hello?

71
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
It's late!

72
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
You are too late to talk to the child.

73
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Hello?

74
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
You are too early to talk to the child.

75
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Don't come to that place.

76
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
You are too early to talk to the child.

77
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Hello?

78
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
This is Mr. Hamada, the child telephone counselor.

79
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Hello?

80
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Hello?

81
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
What's your name?

82
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I'm Matsumoto.

83
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Oh, you're Matsumoto. What's your name?

84
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Sato.

85
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Oh, you're Sato.

86
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
What's your name?

87
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I'm Matsumoto.

88
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Oh, you're Matsumoto?

89
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Matsumoto?

90
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
What's your name?

91
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Sato.

92
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Sato?

93
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Yes.

94
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Matsumoto?

95
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Yes.

96
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Matsumoto?

97
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Yes.

98
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Where's Sato?

99
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Yes.

100
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
What's your name?

101
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Sato Matsumoto.

102
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Your name is Sato?

103
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Yes.

104
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
This is strange.

105
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
You have to think of me.

106
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I'm sorry.

107
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I'm sorry.

108
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I'm sorry.

109
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I'm sorry.

110
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I'm sorry.

111
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I'm sorry.

112
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I'm sorry.

113
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I'm sorry.

114
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Why didn't you say Sato?

115
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Hello?

116
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Hello?

117
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
What's wrong?

118
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I have something to ask you.

119
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
That's why you called me.

120
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
You know...

121
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I'm not interested in Buddhism.

122
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
What?

123
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Why are you interested in children?

124
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I don't care if you're not interested in Buddhism or not.

125
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I want to ask you something childish.

126
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
What?

127
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I'm not interested in Buddhism.

128
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Why are you worried about me?

129
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I want to know more about you.

130
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Something childish.

131
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Hello?

132
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Lately,

133
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I've been thinking about what to eat.

134
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I want to eat squid.

135
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
What should I eat?

136
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Ask your mother.

137
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Don't call me all the time.

138
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
If you call me,

139
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I'll hit you.

140
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
If you want to say something,

141
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
say it.

142
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I'm sorry.

143
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
You should ask your mother.

144
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I want to ask something childish.

145
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Why is a giraffe's neck so long?

146
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
That's a good question.

147
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
It's my first time.

148
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Say it again.

149
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Why is a giraffe's neck so long?

150
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Why is a giraffe's neck so long?

151
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
This is...

152
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
It's not a neck.

153
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Don't call me a giraffe.

154
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I don't want to call you a giraffe.

155
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I don't want to call you a giraffe.

156
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
A giraffe's neck is

157
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
very

158
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
relaxing.

159
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
That's why

160
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I can't wait for a snack at 3 o'clock

161
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
and I have to wait for a long time.

162
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Really?

163
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Yes.

164
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Really?

165
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Yes.

166
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Who is a turtle?

167
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Who is a bear?

168
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I'm not anybody.

169
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I am a bear.

170
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
It's not you.

171
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
A turtle is tomorrow.

172
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
What?

173
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
A snake is beautiful.

174
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
A bear is...

175
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
A gorilla is...

176
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
What's wrong with you?

177
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
That's how it is with children, isn't it?

178
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
How can it be like that?

179
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Zote!

180
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Isn't that stupid?

181
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
If you say such a complicated thing, I'll be in trouble.

182
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I'm a child this time.

183
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
You're a brother.

184
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Hello?

185
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I'd like to ask you something.

186
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
What do you want to ask?

187
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Harry!

188
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Harry!

189
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
How can you answer when you come out?

190
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Brother!

191
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
No one calls you at such a place.

192
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Brother?

193
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Say it.

194
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Hello?

195
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I'd like to ask you something.

196
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
You're a child, aren't you?

197
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
That's how it is with children.

198
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I'd like to ask you something.

199
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
How can you answer when you come out?

200
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Come out properly.

201
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I feel sorry for you.

202
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
How can you answer when you come out?

203
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Hello?

204
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Hello?

205
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Hello?

206
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I'd like to ask you something.

207
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
What is it?

208
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I'd like to ask you something.

209
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I'll say it again.

210
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
This is the children's phone call room.

211
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I'm Matsumoto's sister.

212
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I'm Matsumoto's brother.

213
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I'd like to ask you something.

214
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
What is it?

215
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I'm sorry. I'm in a catch-on.

216
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Why?

217
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I'm not waiting for a child in the call room.

218
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I'm sorry.

219
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I'm not waiting for a child in the call room.

220
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I'm not waiting for a child in the call room.

221
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Hello?

222
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Hello?

223
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Hello?

224
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I'd like to ask you something.

225
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
How can you give birth to a baby?

226
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
How can you give birth to a baby?

227
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:56,000
How do you give birth to a baby?

228
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
How do you say how?

229
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
How do you say how?

230
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
What do you mean by the dog is like a child?

231
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Think about the way you say it!

232
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
You are raising a child and you say,

233
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Hey, the dog is like a child.

234
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
You'd better say it without looking back.

235
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
You are asking something childish.

236
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Childish?

237
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Childish.

238
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Hello? What's the matter?

239
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Hello, brother.

240
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Well...

241
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I have something to ask you.

242
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Why do dogs bark?

243
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
That's a great question, isn't it?

244
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Is it a great question?

245
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Mr.Uni is very tired.

246
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I see.

247
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Why do dogs bark?

248
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
This is a very difficult question.

249
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Is that so?

250
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
So, Mr.Uni, I'll check it out.

251
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Don't hang up the phone. Wait.

252
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I'm sorry.

253
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I'll be out soon.

254
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Don't hang up the phone.

255
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Hello, do you understand?

256
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Don't hang up the phone.

257
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Hurry up.

258
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Hurry up.

259
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
This is a very difficult question.

260
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Can you wait a little longer?

261
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I'm sorry.

262
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I'll be out soon.

263
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I'm sorry.

264
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Can you wait a little longer?

265
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Don't hang up the phone.

266
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Well, I've seen the manga.

267
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I'm doing it.

268
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
It's great, isn't it?

269
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I'm doing the manga.

270
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I don't recommend you to watch my manga.

271
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Is that so?

272
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Because I think you'll lose your confidence.

273
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
What are you talking about?

274
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I can't show you the finished work.

275
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Don't lose your confidence.

276
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,000
We're from a different world.

277
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Really.

278
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
This is the last manga.

279
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Next, the storyboard.

280
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I've been doing this for a long time.

281
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Rolling Thunder Man.

282
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
This is the first time we've ever tried a storyboard.

283
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
We've been doing it as a talking storyboard.

284
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Let's do a storyboard.

285
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
This is the first storyboard.

286
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I like it a lot.

287
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Rolling Thunder Man.

288
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I like it a lot, but I can't do it every time.

289
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I can't do it.

290
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I can't do it every time.

291
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Did you do it on the spot?

292
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I've done it a few times on the spot.

293
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
But I couldn't do it on the spot.

294
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:33,000
On top of that, I couldn't do it on the spot.

295
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I feel lonely being alone.

296
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I feel lonely being alone.

297
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Thank you.

298
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Mister.

299
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Who are you?

300
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I'm Rolling Thunder Man from M36.

301
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Rolling Thunder Man?

302
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Yes.

303
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I didn't know that.

304
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I don't know if it's impossible on Earth.

305
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Impossible?

306
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
What are you doing here?

307
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I'm a Peggy Seijin.

308
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Peggy Seijin?

309
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Yes.

310
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,000
There's information that the evil Peggy Seijin is attacking Earth.

311
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:32,000
If we leave it like this, the people on Earth will get hit by Peggy Seijin or something.

312
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Something?

313
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:42,000
That's why I came to protect this beautiful Earth.

314
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Are you okay?

315
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I'm okay.

316
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Peggy Seijin is coming.

317
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I don't know if Peggy Seijin is looking at you.

318
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I can't do anything.

319
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I'm still a kid.

320
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
That's right.

321
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Be careful.

322
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Thank you.

323
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:08,000
See you.

324
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
You're a strange man.

325
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:22,000
This is from Isojima.

326
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:33,000
It's so hard that it won't open.

327
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Uncle.

328
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Yes.

329
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
What is it?

330
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
It won't open.

331
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
What?

332
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,000
The Isojima lid.

333
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
It's Peggy Seijin's doing.

334
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Really?

335
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Really?

336
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
What a terrible thing.

337
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I'm okay.

338
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Thank you, uncle.

339
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
What a terrible thing.

340
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
It's not a matter of life and death.

341
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
What?

342
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
It's not a matter of life and death.

343
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I'm tired from M36000.

344
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I don't know that.

345
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Be careful.

346
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Thank you, uncle.

347
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Yes.

348
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Uncle.

349
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
What?

350
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I'm scared of Peggy Seijin.

351
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Be quiet.

352
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Rolling Thunder Man Mimi.

353
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
It's not a matter of life and death.

354
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Peggy Seijin is talking bad about you.

355
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I didn't do anything.

356
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
It's not a matter of life and death.

357
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I can hear that you're thinking about evil.

358
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Really?

359
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:33,000
If you don't do anything, Peggy Seijin will pull your hair.

360
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Do something, uncle.

361
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I'm scared.

362
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Where are you, Peggy Seijin?

363
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Peggy Seijin.

364
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Rolling Thunder Man.

365
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
It's not a matter of life and death.

366
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I can hear that you're thinking about evil.

367
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Peggy Seijin is talking bad about you.

368
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
What are you talking about?

369
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
What are you talking about, uncle?

370
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
If you don't do anything,

371
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Rolling Thunder Man...

372
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Are you thinking about it?

373
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Yes.

374
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
What?

375
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I have a good idea.

376
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
What is it?

377
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Even if Peggy Seijin attacks us,

378
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I'll defeat him with Rolling Thunder Man.

379
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
You can defeat him normally.

380
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Then, will you live with me?

381
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I live alone.

382
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Are you sure?

383
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Yes.

384
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Please live with me, uncle.

385
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Please.

386
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Please live with me.

387
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Yes.

388
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Then, three years passed.

389
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I'm home.

390
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Hey.

391
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Hey.

392
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
What are you doing?

393
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Why are you taking off your pants?

394
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
What?

395
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
What are you doing?

396
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Don't do that when you're alone.

397
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I'm not doing anything.

398
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Something stinks.

399
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
What?

400
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Clean up the room.

401
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I feel sick recently.

402
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
You...

403
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Aren't you on the side of justice?

404
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
What?

405
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
It's just the beginning.

406
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Please live with me.

407
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
At the beginning...

408
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
What are you doing?

409
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Why are you taking off your pants?

410
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
What?

411
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
What?

412
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Clean up the room.

413
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I don't want to do that.

414
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
It's your job.

415
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Don't touch me.

416
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I've changed.

417
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I was kind at the beginning.

418
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Why were you kind?

419
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
You're angry because you didn't clean up the room.

420
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
You're not doing anything at home.

421
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Do your job.

422
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Stop it.

423
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Do your job.

424
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I hate you.

425
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I hate you.

426
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,000
What?

427
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
What?

428
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Go home.

429
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
What?

430
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Go home.

431
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Where are you going?

432
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
What?

433
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
When will you stop calling me Peggy Seijin?

434
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
What?

435
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
When will you stop calling me Peggy Seijin?

436
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I told you three years ago.

437
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Rolling Thunder Man.

438
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
It's about time.

439
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
When will you stop calling me Peggy Seijin?

440
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
It's been three years.

441
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
You lied to me.

442
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
That's not true.

443
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
You don't care about Peggy Seijin.

444
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
It's been three years.

445
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
You don't care about Peggy Seijin.

446
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
What are you talking about?

447
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I'm full of clothes.

448
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Do your job.

449
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
What is this?

450
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
What is this shirt?

451
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Why are you dressed up?

452
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Rolling Thunder Man.

453
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
What is this?

454
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Can you beat me?

455
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I can't stand it anymore.

456
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:29,000
If there is only rice, this may be Rolling Thunder Man.

457
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
That's all for today.

458
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
It's been 30 minutes since we started.

459
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
People often ask me to do it.

460
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
It's fun.

461
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
How about doing it for an hour?

462
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
How about doing it for an hour?

463
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
People often ask me to do it.

464
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
You have to do it for 30 minutes.

465
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
You have to do it for 30 minutes.

466
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
It's an hour-long program.

467
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
It's an hour-long program.

468
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
How about doing it for an hour?

469
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
How about doing it for an hour?

470
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
How about doing it for an hour?

471
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I don't know.

472
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,000
It's rare to do this at this time.

473
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Thank you very much.

474
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:20,000
We usually do a stock program.

475
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
We don't have it on this program.

476
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:29,000
I want to put out a stock program.

477
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:34,000
I want to put out a stock program.

478
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I'm not expecting anything.

479
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
I'm not expecting anything.

480
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I'm not expecting anything.

481
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
It's a part of your health.

482
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
It's a part of your health.

483
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,000
We have to do it for the content.

484
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
But we did the opening special.

485
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
We did the opening special.

486
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
We did the punishment game special.

487
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
We did the punishment game special.

488
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
It's nothing when it's done.

489
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
We should make it.

490
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
We should make it.

491
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
We should make it.

492
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
That pattern.

493
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
That's right.

494
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,000
And that one time is mine.

495
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Hey, are you doing this on purpose?

496
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
You're the one who left it at the end, right?

497
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Yes, yes, yes. This is my one time, so don't take it.

498
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,000
That's right, but if you don't use it soon, I might use it.

499
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:40,000
The reason why this is happening is that, the day before yesterday, we were shooting CX for two days.

500
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,000
We were quite tired of CX.

501
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
That's right.

502
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
This is gradually changing.

503
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Is it CX?

504
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I wonder if it's a conversation between CX and Nittere.

505
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:58,000
What kind of conversation is that?

506
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Yes, that's right.

507
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
I wonder if it's a conversation between CX and Nittere.

508
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:29,000
That's right.
