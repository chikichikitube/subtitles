1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Before the recording of Gakidotsukai, we can only see that man who is happy in his private room.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I can only see you.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Yes, I like you.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I'm sorry.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I'll kill you.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Thank you.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Excuse me, Yamazaki-san...

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
What are you doing?

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
What are you talking about?

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Yamazaki-san told us to invite everyone.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Well, it's okay to ignore him.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
He's always like that.

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
He's always like that.

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
He's always like that.

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
What are you thinking about?

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Nothing.

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
He's been happy in his private room lately.

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
But he's depressed.

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
He wants everyone to come.

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I think it's a good idea to invite everyone to this program.

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
That's right.

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
This program is brought to you by these sponsors.

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Excuse me.

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
This way.

25
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
This way.

26
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
He's my senior.

27
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Yes.

28
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Excuse me.

29
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I don't know how to call a senior.

30
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
That's strange.

31
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
What is it?

32
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
You look surprised.

33
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Why are you surprised?

34
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
You look surprised.

35
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm sorry to bother you.

36
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
It's okay.

37
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
He's my senior.

38
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I don't know how to call him.

39
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I'm sorry.

40
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Actually...

41
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I'm living a good life.

42
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I have a beautiful wife that everyone envies.

43
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I have a cute baby called Momo.

44
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I have a cute baby.

45
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Right?

46
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
But...

47
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
My luck has gone to my private life.

48
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Do you remember?

49
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I was on a TV show.

50
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
This show.

51
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
This show.

52
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
This show.

53
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
It was a punishment game.

54
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Everyone came in the middle of the sea.

55
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
When I came out...

56
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I had a cramp in my hip.

57
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
There was a big explosion.

58
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Do you remember?

59
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I don't think so.

60
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
At that time, the god was still there.

61
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I can't go down.

62
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
That was a long time ago.

63
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
A long time ago.

64
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Go!

65
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:46,000
It was a punishment game that challenged the limits of winter.

66
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Hanagaki!

67
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Bring that bag!

68
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Go!

69
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Go!

70
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:17,000
In fact, the god of laughter had come down from the sea.

71
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I've done it before.

72
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I've done it.

73
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
You didn't come down at that time, did you?

74
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
What is this?

75
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
What do you want to do?

76
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
So...

77
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Komu.

78
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Yes.

79
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
What do you have?

80
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
What do you have?

81
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Why is it Komu?

82
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I don't know.

83
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
They're very close.

84
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Komu.

85
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Yes.

86
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
He was right next to me.

87
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
There's only one wasabi in this.

88
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Wasabi cream puff.

89
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Wasabi cream puff.

90
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
It's common.

91
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
It's a common pattern.

92
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
If the god is in this, you'll know.

93
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I know.

94
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:02,000
If the wasabi comes out, we'll be able to record it.

95
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
That's right.

96
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
If the god comes.

97
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Let's go.

98
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Let's go.

99
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
What's wrong?

100
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
It's sweet.

101
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
It's a common one.

102
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
It became like this.

103
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Did you laugh with this?

104
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Did you laugh with this?

105
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
You didn't laugh at all.

106
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I didn't laugh, but...

107
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
But it's one-fifth.

108
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Come on.

109
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Komu.

110
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Yes.

111
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
It's two.

112
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
It's two.

113
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I see.

114
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
This is different.

115
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
It's 50%.

116
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
This is...

117
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
What are you doing?

118
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Zaki.

119
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Really?

120
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Are you serious?

121
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Are you stupid?

122
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Are you serious?

123
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
He's laughing.

124
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
He's laughing.

125
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Should I stop?

126
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
That's...

127
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Well...

128
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
But...

129
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Today was bad.

130
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
It's just a little bad now.

131
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
It's the same as yesterday.

132
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
It's the same as yesterday.

133
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
It's always the same.

134
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Even if it's one-fifth, it's a failure.

135
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Did this man really get separated from God?

136
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I'm going to say some tongue twisters now.

137
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I'll say tongue twisters three times in a row.

138
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
What?

139
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
What did you say?

140
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Tongue twisters.

141
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Tongue twisters.

142
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
What's that?

143
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
What's that?

144
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Tongue twisters.

145
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I usually say tongue twisters and then bite.

146
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I've been doing it for a while now.

147
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
That's right.

148
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
That's true.

149
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
It's not the basis of comedy, is it?

150
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
That's right.

151
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
The time axis is strange.

152
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
There's a distortion.

153
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Distortion?

154
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Distortion.

155
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Distortion.

156
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
There's a distortion.

157
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Yes, distortion.

158
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Well, I'll do it.

159
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Tongue twisters.

160
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I'll say it three times.

161
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Bite.

162
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I'll do it.

163
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Tongue twisters.

164
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Tongue twisters.

165
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I was going to say it three times.

166
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
That's why it's stuck.

167
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
That's why it's stuck.

168
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
This is funny.

169
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:10,000
This is funny.

170
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Hey, Endo.

171
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Yes.

172
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
You try it.

173
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Me?

174
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Yes.

175
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I'm pretty good at it.

176
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Try it.

177
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I'll do it in the middle.

178
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Cut.

179
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Cut.

180
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I'm pretty good at it.

181
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Did you hear that?

182
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Your ears.

183
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Everyone was laughing.

184
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
To be honest.

185
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
To be honest.

186
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Yes.

187
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
They were clapping.

188
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Why?

189
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Is there something wrong with me?

190
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Am I just pretending?

191
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
In the end.

192
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I'll do it at the end.

193
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Cut.

194
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Yama-chan will do it.

195
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Please.

196
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Okay.

197
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Please.

198
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Okay, I'll do it.

199
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Tongue twisters.

200
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
It's funny.

201
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
It's really funny.

202
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
It's funny.

203
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
You said something that wasn't written anywhere.

204
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Yes.

205
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
That's right.

206
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
It wasn't written anywhere.

207
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Hey!

208
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
What is it?

209
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
What is it?

210
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
If it was live.

211
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
If it was live.

212
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
What will happen to me?

213
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
If it was a live broadcast.

214
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I'm done.

215
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
But it was funny.

216
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
It's not about being funny.

217
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
If it was a live broadcast.

218
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I'm done.

219
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Hey.

220
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I'm done.

221
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Tongue twisters.

222
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Tongue twisters.

223
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:52,000
You used your tongue.

224
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Yes.

225
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
This time.

226
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Tongue twisters.

227
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Please bring the tongue twisters.

228
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
The person who hits the roulette will be hit by the tongue twisters.

229
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Yes.

230
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Everyone, stand up.

231
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Yes.

232
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
This is easy to understand.

233
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
It's easy to understand.

234
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Is that so?

235
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
This is easy to understand.

236
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Why is there a gun?

237
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Just in case.

238
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Yes.

239
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Are you ready?

240
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Yes.

241
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Let's go.

242
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Yes.

243
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
It's me.

244
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
You almost hit it.

245
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
It's coming.

246
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,000
It's coming.

247
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
It's me again.

248
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
It's me again.

249
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
It's coming in a row.

250
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
What are you doing?

251
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
What are you doing?

252
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
It's coming in a row.

253
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Come back again.

254
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Come quickly.

255
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Mr. Oda.

256
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Come quickly.

257
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
It's just a coincidence.

258
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
It's just a coincidence.

259
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
It's just a coincidence.

260
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Yes.

261
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
This is completely random.

262
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
It's just a coincidence.

263
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
It's just a coincidence.

264
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I don't care about it.

265
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I don't care about it.

266
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
The next one is a different person.

267
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Yes.

268
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
What's next?

269
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Let's change the spot.

270
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Shall we change the spot?

271
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I want to go to the endo.

272
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Oh, I see.

273
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
If you come to the endo, I'll hold you.

274
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
No, no, it's fine.

275
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I'll take it.

276
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Oh, really?

277
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Yes, it's totally fine.

278
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
It's different.

279
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
This is the endo.

280
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
This is the endo.

281
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I'm here!

282
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Look.

283
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
What, what, what?

284
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I'm here.

285
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I'm here at the endo.

286
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I'm not happy at all.

287
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Why?

288
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I'm not happy at all.

289
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
No, it's the endo.

290
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
That's why I laughed.

291
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I laughed because I wanted to go to the endo.

292
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
It's hot!

293
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
There's still one left.

294
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I don't know.

295
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Wait.

296
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
So...

297
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
What is this?

298
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
What are you going to do with this?

299
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
This is a blower.

300
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Yes.

301
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
What are you going to do?

302
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I'll have you blow it with a blower.

303
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
And I'll stop it with my butt.

304
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Oh.

305
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
And there's a needle in it.

306
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
It hurts.

307
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Just one.

308
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

309
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
This is a good reaction.

310
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Right?

311
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Yes.

312
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Are you ready?

313
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
What are you doing?

314
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Yes.

315
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
This.

316
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Number two.

317
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Number two.

318
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
This hurts.

319
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
That's right.

320
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
It's a needle.

321
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
It's a good reaction.

322
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Here we go.

323
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Ready.

324
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Yes.

325
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
It's stuck.

326
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
It's stuck.

327
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
It's stuck.

328
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
It's stuck.

329
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Do you have a chance?

330
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I have a chance.

331
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I have a chance.

332
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I have a chance.

333
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
You.

334
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
That was close.

335
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
It was close.

336
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
It was close.

337
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
It was one, two.

338
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I was going to blow it.

339
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
It was a little better, wasn't it?

340
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
That's right.

341
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
The flow.

342
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
That's right.

343
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Next.

344
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Bam, bam.

345
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Bam.

346
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Finally, the people smiled.

347
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
If we could make it to Chucrim, it would be a great success.

348
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
What was this?

349
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
What was this?

350
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Which one should I choose?

351
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
That's right.

352
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I think I know.

353
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
It's okay?

354
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Which one should I choose?

355
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Yes.

356
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I know what it is.

357
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Which one is a machine phone and which one is different?

358
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
It's different.

359
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Oh, I see.

360
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Sigh...

361
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Right!

362
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
The right is the machine.

363
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I see.

364
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
You can do it, Yama-chan.

365
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I can make a good reaction.

366
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I'll do a good reaction.

367
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Even if I don't like it.

368
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Here I go!

369
00:12:52,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Hurry up!

370
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
This is terrible!

371
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Why?

372
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I don't know if I can do this.

373
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I'm going to die.

374
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
This machine is totally messed up.

375
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
It's really messed up.

376
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
This is good.

377
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
One of them has Taiki-kun's dad.

378
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
One of them has an old man.

379
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Here it comes.

380
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Here I go.

381
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Here I go.

382
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I'm counting on you!

383
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
It's good!

384
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
It's good!

385
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
It's good!

386
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
It's good!

387
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
It's good!

388
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
That was close!

389
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Zaki-san!

390
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I almost got it.

391
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I was almost there.

392
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
That was close!

393
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
That was close!

394
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
It's hard to get a laugh.

395
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
So Yamasaki-san has a suggestion.

396
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
What should I do?

397
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I think it's much better than before.

398
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
The first half was good.

399
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
The kick was good.

400
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I was talking to Yamasaki-san.

401
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
The wind...

402
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
You did it when you jumped, right?

403
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
When you did the wide jump.

404
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
From that time, I thought the wind was going to Heipo-san.

405
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I did it!

406
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I did it!

407
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
This little middle-aged man is not only good at jumping.

408
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
The fact is interesting.

409
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Certainly, at this moment, the god of laughter is coming down to Heipo.

410
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Certainly, it was interesting.

411
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Well, there are times when it's interesting.

412
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Yamasaki-san is an interesting guy.

413
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
That's why he's aiming for the ball.

414
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
There are too many balls.

415
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Who is it?

416
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Who is it?

417
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Who is it?

418
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I'm not coming out.

419
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
It would be great if I could return it here.

420
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Please let me have a match with Heipo-san.

421
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Really.

422
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
What do you mean?

423
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
What kind of match?

424
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Actually, today...

425
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Shinjuku and Ikebukuro...

426
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
There are two stadiums.

427
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,000
One is a huge fan.

428
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
The other one is a normal small fan.

429
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
We have each of them ready.

430
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
We have them ready.

431
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
And then...

432
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Heipo-san and I...

433
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
You know...

434
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Pants.

435
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Pants and parachutes.

436
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Pants and parachutes.

437
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
We'll go to one of them.

438
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I don't know.

439
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
We'll go to one of them.

440
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Downtown-san.

441
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Kokoriko-san.

442
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I'm not coming out.

443
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I'm not coming out.

444
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Not at all.

445
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
You get it, right?

446
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Yes, I get it.

447
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Please tell me.

448
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Shinjuku or Ikebukuro? Which one?

449
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
It's not which one.

450
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
We'll go to a huge fan.

451
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Let's do that.

452
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
It's only natural for Yama-chan to go there.

453
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
That's for sure.

454
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Right?

455
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
If Heipo-san comes...

456
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
If the god of comedy comes...

457
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Then I'll ask later.

458
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I'll ask which one is bigger.

459
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
You can do it.

460
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
You can do it.

461
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
You can do it.

462
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
It stinks.

463
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
It stinks.

464
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
There are too many flowers.

465
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
In that sense, we want to go to a huge fan.

466
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Please let us go.

467
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Please let us go.

468
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:34,000
From now on, Downtown-san and Kokoriko will go to a huge fan.

469
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I got it.

470
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Shinjuku or Ikebukuro?

471
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
It's one of them.

472
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Which one will you choose?

473
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
It's up to Yama-chan.

474
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
This is really up to me.

475
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
If Saito-san takes me there...

476
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Which one will you choose?

477
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Ikebukuro.

478
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Are you going to Tobiko?

479
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
It's about the same distance.

480
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
About the same distance.

481
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
I got it.

482
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Then I'll go to Shinjuku.

483
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Are you sure?

484
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I'm leaving it to Yama-chan.

485
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I'll go to Shinjuku.

486
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I got it.

487
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
It's a match.

488
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
It's a match.

489
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Why did you decide to go to Ikebukuro?

490
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Well, I've always...

491
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,000
When I first moved to Tokyo,

492
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I went to Ikebukuro.

493
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
It's a big city in Tokyo.

494
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
It's a very popular place.

495
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I see.

496
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I think everyone is waiting for me.

497
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I'm scared.

498
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
I'm scared.

499
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I'm so sad.

500
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Well,

501
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
it's up to Yama-chan.

502
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
We've been waiting for you.

503
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
That's right.

504
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I want him to come.

505
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
You want him to come, right?

506
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Yes.

507
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
If he doesn't come,

508
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I think it'll be fine.

509
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I'm not going to win.

510
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I'm going to be a normal person.

511
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
There might be people who think that.

512
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I think he's calling.

513
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Hello?

514
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Hello?

515
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Yamazaki?

516
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Yes.

517
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Are you here?

518
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Yes.

519
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Yama-chan is quiet.

520
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Yamazaki-san seems to be in a bad mood.

521
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
No, I'm fine.

522
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Really?

523
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Everyone is laughing at me.

524
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Really?

525
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Of course,

526
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
if you come in,

527
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
you'll be able to laugh.

528
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Thank you.

529
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
There's a bigger fan.

530
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
That's good.

531
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
The fan is really big.

532
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
What about HEPO?

533
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
HEPO?

534
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Hello?

535
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Yes.

536
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
I'm HEPO.

537
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Sato-san.

538
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I'm HEPO.

539
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
You're HEPO.

540
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
You're wearing underwear.

541
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Yes, I'm wearing it.

542
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
That's right.

543
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
HEPO, are you ready?

544
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Yes, I just arrived.

545
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
You're really slow.

546
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Are you two okay?

547
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
What's going on?

548
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
What did you two do?

549
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I don't know what's going to happen,

550
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
but we're waiting for you.

551
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Please come to the entrance.

552
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Yes.

553
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
I'm a little nervous.

554
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,000
I don't want to be nervous about something like this.

555
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Have you arrived at the entrance?

556
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Please come.

557
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
What about HEPO?

558
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
I'm here.

559
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Yes.

560
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I'll count from 5 seconds ago.

561
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Open the door at 0 and come in.

562
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Let's go.

563
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
5 seconds.

564
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,000
4, 3, 2, 1.

565
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Go!

566
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
What are you doing?

567
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
What are you doing?

568
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Here, here, here.

569
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Here, here, here.

570
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
You have to get to this point.

571
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
That was close.

572
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I got it.

573
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
I got the feeling.

574
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
I got it normally.

575
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
I'm not going to fly.

576
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
I got it normally.

577
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
So Yamada-san is alive now?

578
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
That's right.

579
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Zaki-san.

580
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Really?

581
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
We can't see the picture over there.

582
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
We can't see it.

583
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
We have to see it.

584
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
We have to see it.

585
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
We'll show you.

586
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Over there, there's only one digital screen.

587
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Thank you.

588
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:12,000
I cried because I didn't want to say anything.

589
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
It's cold.

590
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:36,000
