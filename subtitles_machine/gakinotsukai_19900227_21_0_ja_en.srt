1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
A T H I C C S of it

2
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:27,340
Why are you suddenly alive?

3
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:31,340
Ma'am, Ma'am, Ma'am,

4
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:34,340
I don't think I can finish the water!

5
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:36,340
No! No!

6
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:38,340
I don't want my body!

7
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:44,340
What are you doing?

8
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:46,340
No!

9
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:51,340
No! I don't want my body!

10
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:53,340
If you don't want your body, can you get rid of it?

11
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:54,340
No!

12
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:56,340
No!

13
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:58,340
My nose is clean!

14
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:01,340
Are you kidding me?

15
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:05,340
I don't want my body!

16
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:08,340
What are you doing?

17
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:10,340
You came in earlier than me!

18
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:12,340
What are you waiting for?

19
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:13,340
No!

20
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:15,340
No!

21
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:16,340
Where are you going?

22
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:17,340
I don't want my body!

23
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:20,340
If you do that, you can't come in early.

24
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:23,340
What time did I wake you up?

25
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:25,340
I came in earlier than you!

26
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:26,340
Don't die!

27
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:29,340
You're dressed like this, and you've been waiting in that cold place all the time.

28
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:34,340
Did you know that?

29
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:37,340
I was wondering what it was.

30
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:39,340
I looked over there.

31
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:41,340
I saw the wall.

32
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:43,340
I thought you were a strange woman.

33
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:44,340
Shall we continue?

34
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:45,340
Shall we go home?

35
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:46,340
Yes.

36
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:49,340
If I work 30 more minutes, I'll be on time.

37
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:53,340
I don't want my body!

38
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:55,340
Who are you talking to?

39
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:56,340
He's a virgin!

40
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:00,340
It's on the 7th floor.

41
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:01,340
Yes.

42
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:02,340
It's on the 7th floor.

43
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:03,340
Yes.

44
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:04,340
It's on the 7th floor.

45
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:05,340
Yes.

46
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:07,340
I'd like to ask you how you're doing.

47
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:28,340
Yes.

48
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:33,340
This program is brought to you by Sunluck.

49
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:38,340
Ooyama International Products.

50
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:42,340
This program is brought to you by these sponsors.

51
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:51,340
Ladies and gentlemen.

52
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:53,340
Hello.

53
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,340
I'm Hamada from Down Down.

54
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,340
Nice to meet you.

55
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:56,340
Hey.

56
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:58,340
Oh, mama.

57
00:02:58,340 --> 00:02:59,340
It was so quiet.

58
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:00,340
I was scared.

59
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:03,340
I was scared.

60
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:05,340
I thought I'd do my first episode of Apocryphal.

61
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:06,340
That's true.

62
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:07,340
You're not laughing.

63
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:08,340
Apocryphal.

64
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:09,340
You're not laughing.

65
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:10,340
You're not laughing.

66
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:11,340
You're not laughing.

67
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:12,340
This is too much.

68
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:13,340
Yes.

69
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:14,340
This morning,

70
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:15,340
Yes.

71
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:16,340
This morning,

72
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:17,340
Yes.

73
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:18,340
This morning,

74
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:19,340
Why?

75
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:20,340
This is the first time we're shooting in Japan.

76
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:22,340
Don't say such things.

77
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:24,340
I can't hide it.

78
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:26,340
This is the first time.

79
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,340
This is the first time.

80
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:29,340
Yes.

81
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:35,340
The customers are not always in a high mood.

82
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,340
Really?

83
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:39,340
From now on, they will be in a high mood little by little.

84
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:41,340
It was raining a little.

85
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:43,340
When it rains, it's no good.

86
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:44,340
It will be like this.

87
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:45,340
No good.

88
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:46,340
Why is that?

89
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:48,340
What will it look like?

90
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:51,340
I'm a man of rain.

91
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:52,340
Really?

92
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:53,340
Yes.

93
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:54,340
Where did it rain when you went?

94
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:56,340
When I wanted to do a tournament, it was raining.

95
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:57,340
Really?

96
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:59,340
Yes, really.

97
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:00,340
I don't know.

98
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,340
I went to Saipan the other day.

99
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:05,340
It's a little different from the program, but I met you in my dream.

100
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:10,340
When I went to Saipan, it was raining when it rained so much.

101
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:12,340
Yes, it was raining for about an hour.

102
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:13,340
It was raining.

103
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:15,340
I'm really a man of rain.

104
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:17,340
It just happened to be that.

105
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:20,340
No matter what I do, it's always raining.

106
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:22,340
It was like that today, too.

107
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:23,340
It's so cute.

108
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:25,340
There's nothing special about it.

109
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:27,340
What's special about it?

110
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:29,340
There's nothing special about it.

111
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:30,340
That's right.

112
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:31,340
What is it?

113
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:33,340
That time and that time.

114
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:35,340
What time is it?

115
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:37,340
That time and that time.

116
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:39,340
That time and that time.

117
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:41,340
There are only two.

118
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:43,340
I'm a man of rain.

119
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:45,340
There's only Saipan in Kyoto.

120
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:46,340
Yes.

121
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:47,340
Really.

122
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:50,340
I couldn't say much when I went to Saipan.

123
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:53,340
It's no good if it rains so much.

124
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:55,340
I thought so, too.

125
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:58,340
It's said that the current comedy is the third generation.

126
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:00,340
Everyone is serious.

127
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:02,340
Everyone is serious.

128
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:04,340
You don't really play with women, do you?

129
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:05,340
That's right.

130
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:09,340
Saipan is a bread of bread.

131
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:11,340
Why can't you play more?

132
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:13,340
Everyone.

133
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:16,340
But I don't know if you're abnormal.

134
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:18,340
I was jealous of one person.

135
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:21,340
Everyone, you, Nan-chan, U-chan,

136
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:23,340
It's cold.

137
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:26,340
Women are very serious.

138
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:27,340
Serious.

139
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:30,340
That's why I went to the disco in Saipan.

140
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:33,340
There are only men.

141
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:35,340
What is it?

142
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:36,340
What is it?

143
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:38,340
What is it?

144
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:40,340
Tell me.

145
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,340
What is it?

146
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,340
I don't know.

147
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:45,340
It's strange.

148
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:47,340
There are only men.

149
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:48,340
I don't think so.

150
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:54,340
The staff brought five or six women to the floor.

151
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:57,340
They brought them here for us.

152
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:59,340
They separated them.

153
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:01,340
Men and women, men and women.

154
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:03,340
They put them in properly.

155
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:05,340
U-chan and I were sitting here.

156
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:08,340
We sat in our own seats.

157
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:11,340
U-chan, sit down.

158
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:12,340
Sit down.

159
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:14,340
U-chan.

160
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,340
No way.

161
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:18,340
I said, no way.

162
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:20,340
I sat down.

163
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:22,340
I was talking to myself.

164
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,340
U-chan, what do you think?

165
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:27,340
U-chan sat down with a woman on both sides.

166
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:29,340
The woman next to me.

167
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:30,340
What is it?

168
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:33,340
U-chan and Nan-chan are like this.

169
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:35,340
They are like soldiers.

170
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:38,340
They are sitting with their backs to each other.

171
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:39,340
Right?

172
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:41,340
This is not good.

173
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:43,340
I was like that.

174
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:46,340
I didn't have to say anything.

175
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:49,340
But the producer, Sato-chan.

176
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:51,340
Nan-chan, you are newly married.

177
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:53,340
Please be patient.

178
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:56,340
If you get excited, come in.

179
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:58,340
I said, okay.

180
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:00,340
I sat down and looked around.

181
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:02,340
They were like this.

182
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:04,340
There were two women.

183
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:07,340
I aimed at one of them.

184
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:09,340
You were fast.

185
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:14,340
They were like this.

186
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:16,340
I like them.

187
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:18,340
You like them too much.

188
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:20,340
I aimed at one of them.

189
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:22,340
You like them too much.

190
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:25,340
I was making a joke like a machine gun.

191
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:28,340
They were like this.

192
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:30,340
I didn't like them.

193
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:32,340
I came to the court early in the morning.

194
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:35,340
They were tired.

195
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:37,340
They were tired.

196
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:39,340
Don't laugh.

197
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:41,340
I want to say it alone.

198
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:45,340
They were tired.

199
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:47,340
They were tired.

200
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:50,340
I couldn't talk to them.

201
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:52,340
What?

202
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:54,340
It was bad.

203
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:56,340
I thought I had to go.

204
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:58,340
I will change my room.

205
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:01,340
I will change my room.

206
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:03,340
You know my room, right?

207
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:05,340
I don't know.

208
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:07,340
I know my room.

209
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:09,340
I went home, too.

210
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:11,340
I came back to my room.

211
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:16,340
Your face is long.

212
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:18,340
You were in a toilet.

213
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:21,340
You were in a shower.

214
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:23,340
You were in a shower.

215
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:25,340
That's right.

216
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:30,340
I'm sorry.

217
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:31,340
I'm sorry.

218
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:34,340
If you want to read, you have to wait.

219
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:36,340
That girl can't wait.

220
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:37,340
That's strange.

221
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:38,340
It's strange.

222
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:39,340
There must be something.

223
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:42,340
Yeah, but it's not cool to play around like that.

224
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:44,340
So I just calm down.

225
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:47,340
I change into Yukata.

226
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:50,340
You change into Yukata and wait.

227
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:51,340
What a setup.

228
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:55,340
I'm not aware of that at all.

229
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:57,340
At that point, you're already aware of it.

230
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:59,340
I thought I was going to sleep.

231
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:03,340
When I fell asleep, I was like, ahhh.

232
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:06,340
I don't want to be like that.

233
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:08,340
I was sleeping normally like this.

234
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:10,340
I was sleeping for a little while.

235
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:13,340
I don't know why, but something was bothering me.

236
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:15,340
I woke up right away.

237
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:18,340
It's been about an hour and a half since then.

238
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:19,340
It's strange.

239
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:20,340
It's strange.

240
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:23,340
It's strange.

241
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:25,340
I'm wearing a jeep again.

242
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:26,340
Why?

243
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:27,340
Be careful.

244
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:29,340
I'm wearing a jumper again.

245
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:30,340
You're going down again.

246
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:32,340
I'm going down again.

247
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:35,340
The disco is covered with glass.

248
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:38,340
It's like a stone wall.

249
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:42,340
The outside is covered with glass.

250
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:43,340
It's a stone wall.

251
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:45,340
I can't see the inside.

252
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:48,340
What's going on?

253
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:51,340
I can't get into the disco.

254
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:53,340
The people in front of the disco are foreigners.

255
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:55,340
They don't understand English.

256
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:57,340
I thought I shouldn't look at the situation inside.

257
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:59,340
At about 1 o'clock in the morning,

258
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:02,340
I climbed up the stone wall.

259
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:06,340
Turn around the entrance.

260
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:10,340
I wanted to do that much.

261
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:12,340
I climbed up the stone wall.

262
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:14,340
No one was there.

263
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:17,340
No one was in the disco.

264
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:19,340
I thought I shouldn't do that.

265
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:22,340
I thought I should go to bed.

266
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:26,340
I put the card key in my pocket.

267
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:27,340
I can't open it.

268
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:28,340
It's broken.

269
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:30,340
The key is broken.

270
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:33,340
It's broken and I can't open it.

271
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:35,340
I'm sleepy in this situation.

272
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:38,340
I can't open the key at about 1 o'clock.

273
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:39,340
I don't know what to do.

274
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:41,340
The people in front of the disco are foreigners.

275
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:42,340
I don't know what to do.

276
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:43,340
I don't know.

277
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:44,340
I can't speak English.

278
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:45,340
I can't speak English at all.

279
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:48,340
I thought I should look for Nitta.

280
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:49,340
Nitta's room.

281
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:50,340
Nitta's room.

282
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:51,340
Nitta's room.

283
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:52,340
Nitta's room.

284
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:55,340
Open the door.

285
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:58,340
I talked to Nitta.

286
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:00,340
Nitta, I can't open the key.

287
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:01,340
Do something.

288
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:06,340
I'll be there in a little while.

289
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:08,340
Kill me.

290
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:11,340
Really.

291
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:13,340
Nitta didn't like it.

292
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:15,340
I was having fun.

293
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:17,340
I came here thinking about this kid.

294
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:20,340
I went to the front door and opened the door.

295
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:22,340
It was the night of the trial.

296
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:24,340
I read a magazine about Yuya.

297
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:26,340
I went to the trial.

298
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:31,340
It was a world of father and son.

299
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:32,340
That's not true.

300
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:35,340
Everyone is serious.

301
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:37,340
The members who were there were.

302
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:38,340
I was away from them.

303
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:40,340
I was watching.

304
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:43,340
I was thinking about Yuya and Nanta.

305
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:47,340
There was a staff at the table over there.

306
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:49,340
I went there.

307
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:51,340
Nanta came on the way.

308
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:52,340
What are you doing?

309
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:54,340
Everyone was there.

310
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:55,340
What about that woman?

311
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:58,340
It's okay.

312
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:02,340
You're doing a wasteful thing.

313
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:03,340
Let's go to karaoke.

314
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:06,340
We all went to karaoke.

315
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:12,340
Nanta was in the room.

316
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:14,340
I closed the yukata and waited for him.

317
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:16,340
Really.

318
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:20,340
I can't hold it.

319
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:22,340
What is this?

320
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:27,340
Let's go to the back of the bar.

321
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:29,340
Foreigners are bad.

322
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:31,340
Foreigners don't get along with foreigners.

323
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:34,340
That's true.

324
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:37,340
Japanese people work hard.

325
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:39,340
That's true.

326
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:45,340
Especially in warm countries.

327
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:47,340
They are lazy.

328
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:48,340
They are lazy.

329
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:51,340
They don't move much.

330
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:53,340
The people who built houses were like that.

331
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:56,340
They didn't use cement.

332
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:59,340
It took about 10 years to build a house.

333
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:02,340
It was like a competition with Alizuka.

334
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:04,340
It's amazing.

335
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:08,340
I went to the cafeteria.

336
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:14,340
Everyone in the 14th place was like an old woman.

337
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:16,340
I'm getting angry.

338
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:19,340
I want to see her soon.

339
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,340
But my body doesn't listen to me.

340
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:23,340
Everyone is hungry.

341
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:25,340
Japan is fast.

342
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:29,340
There are people who get angry at work.

343
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:31,340
They are different.

344
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:37,340
I went to a Chinese restaurant.

345
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:40,340
They are fast.

346
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:42,340
They are fast.

347
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:44,340
It takes about a minute.

348
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:45,340
Especially in Oshawa.

349
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:46,340
Especially in Oshawa.

350
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:48,340
It was terrible.

351
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:51,340
Everyone was thirsty.

352
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:53,340
They wanted to drink coke.

353
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:57,340
Everyone was like this.

354
00:13:57,340 --> 00:14:02,340
Everyone was like this.

355
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:04,340
Everyone was like this.

356
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:08,340
Everyone was like this.

357
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:10,340
Don't move.

358
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:11,340
Don't move.

359
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:14,340
I opened the refrigerator.

360
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:16,340
It's hot, so I opened the refrigerator.

361
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:20,340
I enjoyed the cool air.

362
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:24,340
I opened the refrigerator.

363
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:27,340
It was cool.

364
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:29,340
I put it on the glass.

365
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:32,340
I was surprised by bubbles.

366
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:34,340
I was surprised by bubbles.

367
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:42,340
Please bring it to me.

368
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:45,340
What kind of assistant is she?

369
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:50,340
I want to be cute.

370
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:54,340
I have received many fan letters from Nitta.

371
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:55,340
Really?

372
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:57,340
First of all, I want to meet Nitta-san.

373
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:58,340
Who is it?

374
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:01,340
Let me introduce him.

375
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:03,340
This person...

376
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:05,340
I haven't written his name yet.

377
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:12,340
Please tell me about your Valentine's day.

378
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:13,340
Valentine's day.

379
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:15,340
Valentine's day...

380
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:19,340
Well, nowadays, I get chocolates for doing this kind of work.

381
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:24,340
But I didn't get chocolates when I was a student.

382
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:27,340
When I was in the first year of junior high school,

383
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:32,340
I remember that I gave chocolates to a very annoying guy.

384
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:36,340
Did you give chocolates to him?

385
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:39,340
Everyone hated me.

386
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:42,340
Everyone called me Machamachi.

387
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:45,340
Everyone called me Machamachi.

388
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:49,340
I was a very strong pig.

389
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:51,340
I was not a normal pig.

390
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:52,340
You were a 100-kant pig.

391
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:55,340
I was a 100-kant pig.

392
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:57,340
I was even better than that.

393
00:15:57,340 --> 00:16:00,340
When I walked on the streets, I would make noise like a bird.

394
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:01,340
You are a fool.

395
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:02,340
You are a fool.

396
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:04,340
I was such a scary guy.

397
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:07,340
I would make noise like a bird because I was in danger.

398
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:09,340
Really?

399
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:10,340
Really?

400
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:12,340
I was very strong like a bull.

401
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:13,340
I was a pig like that.

402
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:16,340
I would run around and something would happen.

403
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:17,340
Something would happen.

404
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:20,340
I was very strong like an electric jellyfish.

405
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:22,340
Really?

406
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:23,340
Where did you live?

407
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:25,340
You were an electric jellyfish.

408
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:26,340
I was a pig like that.

409
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:28,340
This is my feeling.

410
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:31,340
You had a great feeling.

411
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:33,340
I was wearing a scarf.

412
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:36,340
Everyone was laughing at me.

413
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:38,340
Everyone was laughing at you.

414
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:40,340
Everyone was laughing at you.

415
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:41,340
That was also a hand-knitting.

416
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:42,340
That was also a hand-knitting.

417
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:43,340
That was a hand-knitting.

418
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:45,340
I am sorry on that.

419
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:48,340
I was sad.

420
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:51,340
Since everyone was watching, you should get the offering.

421
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:53,340
Yes, I will.

422
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:54,340
I will say thank you.

423
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:56,340
I will say thank you.

424
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:59,340
I will, but you have a rice fields in front of your house.

425
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:00,340
So, I will go to the rice fields.

426
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:06,340
What a bad guy.

427
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:09,340
I don't know why you were so fat.

428
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:13,340
But, with all your heart, you don't care about that kind of thing, do you?

429
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:16,340
It's a lie.

430
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:17,340
It's a lie!

431
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:20,340
You're going to turn into a fire!

432
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:23,340
Are you taking a walk?

433
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:26,340
The frog looks a little cold.

434
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:27,340
Ah, I see.

435
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:31,340
I'll tell you another wonderful story.

436
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:32,340
Really?

437
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:33,340
I think this story will be very popular.

438
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:35,340
What kind of story? Tell me, tell me.

439
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:38,340
Well, it's an interesting story.

440
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:41,340
It's from Kanagawa Prefecture.

441
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:45,340
I want you to come to the Fujisawa Labor Council building in the neighborhood.

442
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:48,340
Don't mess with me!

443
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:52,340
Write something else!

444
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:54,340
There's a lot of things to write!

445
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:56,340
It's not like this.

446
00:17:56,340 --> 00:18:00,340
You can say that there was something like this in the question.

447
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:02,340
Right?

448
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:03,340
Kanagawa Prefecture.

449
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:04,340
Kanagawa Prefecture...

450
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:07,340
Speak properly!

451
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:10,340
It's quite far from here.

452
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,340
It's close.

453
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:13,340
It's close.

454
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:16,340
I don't really know where this is.

455
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:18,340
This is...

456
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:21,340
It's called Kinshicho.

457
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:24,340
When you say Kinshicho...

458
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:27,340
What do you eat?

459
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:30,340
Suginami.

460
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:32,340
Neri-maki.

461
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:34,340
Sumida-kun.

462
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:36,340
I don't know anything about that.

463
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:38,340
Ah, but it's already...

464
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:39,340
It's in Chiba, isn't it?

465
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:40,340
If you go a little further.

466
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:41,340
What?

467
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:44,340
Don't make such a dirty face.

468
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:46,340
It's close to Chiba.

469
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:49,340
It's quite far from here.

470
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:51,340
It's in the countryside, isn't it?

471
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:53,340
It's in the countryside, isn't it?

472
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:55,340
When I was filming earlier,

473
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:56,340
everyone was like,

474
00:18:56,340 --> 00:19:00,340
Dabe-dabe!

475
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:05,340
You don't need to say that.

476
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:09,340
Someone who lives at this time on a weekday like this...

477
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:11,340
Isn't he a good-looking person?

478
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:15,340
Say you want to come,

479
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:16,340
and bring your letter.

480
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:17,340
Come on, say it.

481
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:18,340
Say something like that.

482
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:19,340
It doesn't have anything to do with the program, but...

483
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:21,340
What do you usually do?

484
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:23,340
Are you a student?

485
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:24,340
Do you have anyone working?

486
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:26,340
What do you usually do?

487
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:28,340
I work part-time.

488
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:29,340
Eh? Are you from the Philippines?

489
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:30,340
Idiot!

490
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:32,340
Aren't you from Japan?

491
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:35,340
When are you coming back?

492
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:38,340
I work part-time.

493
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:39,340
What do you usually do?

494
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:40,340
I work part-time.

495
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:42,340
What's the name of the restaurant?

496
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:43,340
Tamori.

497
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:45,340
Tamori?

498
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:46,340
Call me that!

499
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:50,340
Say it's San-to! San-to!

500
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:52,340
Well, that's about it.

501
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:53,340
Shall we go home now?

502
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:54,340
That's right.

503
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:56,340
It's really hard to go home.

504
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:58,340
I wonder how they wrote it.

505
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:00,340
Let's have them write again.

506
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:01,340
That's right.

507
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:05,340
You want to see this again, don't you?

508
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:07,340
What are you doing?

509
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:10,340
I don't know.

510
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:12,340
Well, that's all for today.

511
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:13,340
Thank you for coming.

512
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:16,340
Shall we do a Q&A?

513
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:20,340
What is it?

514
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:28,340
There's only one thing I can do.

515
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:30,340
Think about it.

516
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:31,340
There must be something.

517
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:32,340
Tell me.

518
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:35,340
There's only one thing I'm really good at.

519
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:37,340
Dad, can I ask you something?

520
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:39,340
Don't laugh.

521
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:41,340
It's really funny.

522
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:42,340
Try it on me.

523
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:43,340
I can't even do it.

524
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:45,340
I'm Masakatsu Tamura.

525
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:48,340
Dad, can I ask you something?

526
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:55,340
I want to eat curry with you.

527
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:57,340
What is that?

528
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:03,340
That's all for today.

529
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:04,340
Thank you very much.

530
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:05,340
That's all for today.

531
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:07,340
Thank you very much.

532
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:09,340
Thank you very much.

533
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:14,340
Today's opening was a failure.

534
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:16,340
Hey.

535
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:17,340
Yes?

536
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:19,340
What is it?

537
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:20,340
Today's opening was a failure.

538
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:21,340
That's right.

539
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:24,340
It was hard to shoot at the place where Hamada wasn't there.

540
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:25,340
Is that so?

541
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:29,340
I've been shooting for three or four days.

542
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:33,340
When you came in, everyone was talking about something else.

543
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:36,340
I was trying not to be noticed by Hamada.

544
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:39,340
There was a time when I was late for this program.

545
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:43,340
I was doing all that for Hamada.

546
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:44,340
Don't lie.

547
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:46,340
I wasn't really late.

548
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:50,340
I'm looking for an idea for a costume.

549
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:51,340
I see.

550
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:52,340
What kind of costume do you want?

551
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:53,340
That's right.

552
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:58,340
Especially, I want to hear the opinion of the person who went to a good place with a costume.

553
00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:01,340
How can I get into the fans?

554
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:03,340
Advice.

555
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:04,340
Advice.

556
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:06,340
What kind of costume do you want?

557
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:07,340
That's right.

558
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:09,340
I want to hear the opinion of the person who went to a good place with a costume.

559
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:10,340
Yes.

560
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:14,340
And, the Fuzusawa Labor Association.

561
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:15,340
Please come.
