1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hello.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Hello.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Yes, yes.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I was just thinking...

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
No, no, no.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
This is a long intro.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
It's long, isn't it?

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
It's long, isn't it?

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
It's long, isn't it?

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
This program is brought to you by these sponsors.

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Yes, yes.

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
You...

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Your heart isn't here.

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Well, you know...

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Are you okay?

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
No, I can't go home.

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
In public shows,

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
there are people who lose their motivation.

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
They don't all smile.

20
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
No, no, no.

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
They're the type who are brought here.

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
It's probably luck.

23
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I think it's definitely luck.

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I didn't want to see anything.

25
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
You didn't raise your face, did you?

26
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
No, I didn't raise my face.

27
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
You were like this the whole time.

28
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
It was like the morning of a school trip.

29
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
It was just a pillow.

30
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I was holding a pillow like this.

31
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
That's terrible.

32
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Didn't you say you were going on a trip?

33
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
What kind of trip?

34
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
You said you were going on a trip when it was over.

35
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
If there wasn't a regular show, I'd like to be on it.

36
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I'll be there.

37
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
So I was wondering what to do.

38
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Go somewhere.

39
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Thank you for your help in the drama.

40
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
You don't have to say it like that.

41
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Thank you very much.

42
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Well, I don't know what to do if I'm told this is a school trip.

43
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
It's better to say it like this.

44
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
There was some weird atmosphere.

45
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
In places like this, there's usually a lot of people.

46
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
But when you're in that kind of atmosphere,

47
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
it's like, wow, who's this guy?

48
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
It's Hamada! It's Hamada from Dandan!

49
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
That's disgusting.

50
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
No matter what they say.

51
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Really.

52
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Well, I don't care.

53
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
If I'm told to dress like this,

54
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
they'll be like,

55
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Oh, really?

56
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Really, it was kind of amazing.

57
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
But, you know...

58
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
What?

59
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
The drama is so tiring!

60
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Shut up!

61
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I've been doing it for three months.

62
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
That's true.

63
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
The last scene I was filming,

64
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
what was it?

65
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
It was a mess.

66
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
The last scene, the last cut,

67
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I thought it would be a little more moving.

68
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I had a bouquet of flowers and asked for a word.

69
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
That was the situation.

70
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
But that...

71
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Right behind that,

72
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
there was a clerk.

73
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
The clerk's location was like,

74
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Get out of the way!

75
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
It was like, gah!

76
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
It was starting.

77
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
And I was like, I don't care about you guys.

78
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
And the clerk was like,

79
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Thank you very much!

80
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
It was the worst way to end it,

81
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
to make it look like he was running away.

82
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
You should've moved to a different location.

83
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Really.

84
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I didn't know what to do.

85
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
But that's how it was.

86
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I want to go on a trip.

87
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I really want to.

88
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
You should go!

89
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I don't have time.

90
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I have to go once a week.

91
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
This is...

92
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
This is going to be a hot topic, right?

93
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
That's true.

94
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Wherever you go,

95
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
this is going to be a hot topic.

96
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
It's like the old Itom.

97
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I don't know about that.

98
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Didn't you take a break from Itom?

99
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
You said you were going on a trip with your family.

100
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I didn't take a break at all.

101
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
You didn't take a break?

102
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
No.

103
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I remembered the story of how I got really angry.

104
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
The story of how I felt sorry for Mach-chan.

105
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
This guy...

106
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
It's New Year's Day, right?

107
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
It's New Year's Day!

108
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
You always take a break on New Year's Day.

109
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
On New Year's Day,

110
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
this guy...

111
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I don't know what he said.

112
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
He said he was going overseas.

113
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
He doesn't take a break on New Year's Day.

114
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
New Year's Day is three or four days, right?

115
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
You said you wanted to go on a trip with your family.

116
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
If I wanted to go, I would go every year.

117
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I can't go for three days.

118
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
He said he wanted to go.

119
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
He said he wanted to take a break.

120
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I said, okay, I'll go.

121
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I thought I'd take a break too.

122
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
He said, no, just Matsumoto should go.

123
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I said, no, just the two of us.

124
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Please take care of me.

125
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I said it many times.

126
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
You said it many times?

127
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I said it many times.

128
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Please take care of me.

129
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
No, no, no.

130
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I said, no, no.

131
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
He said, no, no, no.

132
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Abba-chan has a family too.

133
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I was wondering what he meant by that.

134
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
He said, okay, then, please take a break on New Year's Day.

135
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
That's right.

136
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I said I'd go for three days.

137
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
That's right.

138
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I said, okay, then, please take a break on New Year's Day.

139
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
If you say so, I'll go.

140
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
He said he would.

141
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I said, okay, then, please take a break on New Year's Day.

142
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I wanted to take a video.

143
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I wanted to take a video of myself.

144
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
The schedule couldn't be filled in in that video.

145
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
If I didn't have a good friend...

146
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
You could go.

147
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I could go.

148
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I wanted to use the time I had at that time.

149
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
That's right.

150
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
It's work, it's work.

151
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I said, please let me use it here.

152
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
He said, it's okay.

153
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
He said, it's okay.

154
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Did he really say, it's okay?

155
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I was filming a video.

156
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I used the time I had at that time.

157
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I was in Kyoto.

158
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I was filming there.

159
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
It was time for a good friend.

160
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I happened to be able to watch it.

161
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I watched it on TV.

162
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Tamaguchi-san came out.

163
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
He came out in glasses.

164
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I think it's okay.

165
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
He came out.

166
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
He came out.

167
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
It's okay from there.

168
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
It's okay after that.

169
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I don't know what to say.

170
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Mach-chan suddenly got a fever and collapsed.

171
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
What?

172
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Your family trip is going well.

173
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Even if I take a break from work, if I have a fever, I have to lie.

174
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
What kind of fever is this?

175
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Who has a fever?

176
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Who has a fever?

177
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I don't know about that.

178
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
That's how you do it on Uji TV.

179
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
It was really bad.

180
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I felt a little better.

181
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Now I have a fever.

182
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Well, let's go home.

183
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I want to go home.

184
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I want to go home.

185
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Why?

186
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Is someone waiting for me?

187
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
It sounds good.

188
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Wow!

189
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I have something I want to ask you.

190
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
What?

191
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
What do you want to ask me?

192
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Stop pretending.

193
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
What?

194
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Someone is waiting for you.

195
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
It's the first time I've said that.

196
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I don't like it.

197
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I don't like it.

198
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I'm so excited.

199
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I want to go home soon.

200
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
No, no.

201
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
It doesn't matter if it's another show.

202
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:21,000
When a female guest comes, she says she's been a fan for a long time.

203
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I don't know what to do when I'm told that.

204
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
That's why my face turns red.

205
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I want to do something about it.

206
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
It's okay to be surprised.

207
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
It's a close save.

208
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
And when she comes back, her face will be strange again.

209
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Why?

210
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Really.

211
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Why?

212
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
There are some female guests who come and touch me strangely.

213
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
If you do that, your face will turn red.

214
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
It's getting worse.

215
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I used to be fine.

216
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Why is that?

217
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
What's wrong with you?

218
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Who are you talking to?

219
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Your face won't turn red.

220
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Who are you talking to?

221
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I want to go home.

222
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Let's go home.

223
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Let's go home.

224
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
You said it perfectly.

225
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
In your hot underwear.

226
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I don't remember such an old story.

227
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I have a question for you.

228
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Yes.

229
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
What should I do if someone takes my back?

230
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
It's said that you're the most free.

231
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
If someone takes your back?

232
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
If someone takes your back.

233
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
No matter how good you are, no one can take your back.

234
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
As long as it's me, it's okay.

235
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Even if someone takes it?

236
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Even if someone takes it.

237
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
What will happen if someone takes your back?

238
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
That's right.

239
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
For example, like this.

240
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
If you do this, you can't move.

241
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:20,000
If you do this, you can't move.

242
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:26,000
In an instant, I thought I was in the end.

243
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
When that happens, you don't know what to do.

244
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I see.

245
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
You can't move.

246
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
You can't move.

247
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
In your case, it's okay.

248
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
As long as it's me, it's okay.

249
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
What is it?

250
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Let's take your back.

251
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Like this, right?

252
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Are you suddenly going to do that?

253
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I don't think you can take my back.

254
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Oh, really?

255
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Yes.

256
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Then what should I do?

257
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
What?

258
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Take your back.

259
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
What?

260
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Take your back.

261
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Take my back.

262
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Wait a minute.

263
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Wait a minute.

264
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Wait a minute.

265
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Let go of me.

266
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Let go of me.

267
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
It hurts here.

268
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
That's why I don't feel like doing it anymore.

269
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
In that situation, you lost.

270
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
That's not it.

271
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
That's not it.

272
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
That's not it.

273
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
You're not like that.

274
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
How does a fight start?

275
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
The water hits your shoulder.

276
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
That's fine.

277
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
You hit me, right?

278
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
You hit me, right?

279
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Shut up.

280
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Shut up?

281
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Where did you find that?

282
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Listen to me.

283
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I was surprised.

284
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I was surprised.

285
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
The most important thing for me is not to go wild.

286
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I see.

287
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
If I go wild, I'll avoid it.

288
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I see.

289
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I have to have love for the other person.

290
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I have to have love for the other person.

291
00:10:52,000 --> 00:11:00,000
This is the rhythm of a rambutan.

292
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
My butt has been here all this time.

293
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I'm sorry.

294
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I'm sorry.

295
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I told you to let go.

296
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Let go.

297
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
If you keep doing this.

298
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
You're only using your upper body.

299
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,000
You're only using your lower body.

300
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
You will really let go.

301
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
You will have another love.

302
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
That's how it is.

303
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Are you serious?

304
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
This is why I'm getting 800,000 yen.

305
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
That's the best for me.

306
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,000
It's a question for you, Mr. Matsumoto.

307
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
You were at the bar and was in the bathroom for a long time and people would think you were taking a dump.

308
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
When you were returning to the seat, you were a little embarrassed.

309
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Why did you have to put on a show that you're not taking a dump?

310
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Well, there are.

311
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
There are?

312
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Yes, there are.

313
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
But I don't care.

314
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Whether it takes long or short.

315
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I'm going to the toilet, so I don't care.

316
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
There are quiet toilets.

317
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I'm curious about the sound at those times.

318
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
If it takes a long time, I don't care.

319
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Or if I have to endure until the last minute.

320
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
While talking at the coffee shop.

321
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
When I get to the entrance,

322
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I say, sorry, I need to go to the toilet.

323
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Then I immediately go out.

324
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I immediately go out.

325
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
That's what I...

326
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
That's what you use.

327
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
That's what I think is best.

328
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Even that can be seen.

329
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
The way you move your face.

330
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Also, when you drink coffee at the coffee shop,

331
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
once...

332
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
What is it?

333
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
No, no.

334
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
If you decide on that, it's no good.

335
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
No matter what you do, you'll die.

336
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
What should I do now?

337
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
This is really...

338
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I think this is a really good method.

339
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
You can do it as many times as you want.

340
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
What do you mean?

341
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
You can do it as many times as you want.

342
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
That's fine.

343
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
During that time, maybe that person is pooping.

344
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
That's what I think.

345
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
That's what you think.

346
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
You can think about it.

347
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Just think about it.

348
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
If you can make it look like it was different later,

349
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
then the result is alright.

350
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
That's right.

351
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
It's a way to come back.

352
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
If you can make it look like it was different.

353
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
That's the best.

354
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
That's what I mean.

355
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I can do it properly.

356
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I really can.

357
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
You go like this, right?

358
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Should we go out?

359
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Where?

360
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Let's go out to the toilet.

361
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Okay.

362
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Wait for me.

363
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
This is a really good method.

364
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Okay.

365
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I can do it.

366
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
That's the best.

367
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
That's the best.

368
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I don't think it'll end like this.

369
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
No, no, no.

370
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
You can't go in from here.

371
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I just think it's cool.

372
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
The other woman will probably think,

373
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I don't care about that.

374
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
She'll definitely think that.

375
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I think this is the best.

376
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Really?

377
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
You don't think so because your boyfriend did that, right?

378
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
What's with you?

379
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I feel like I can go home.

380
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
What's that?

381
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
This is the best.

382
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Really?

383
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
You can use either of them.

384
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Until the entrance.

385
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
No, I can't use the entrance.

386
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Why not?

387
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I'll definitely go out.

388
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
You won't?

389
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I'll go out.

390
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I'll go up and before I crouch,

391
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I'll go like this.

392
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Idiot.

393
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
You have your own will.

394
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
You can leave your grandma here.

395
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
You have something else.

396
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
You have something else.

397
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
It's impossible.

398
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
It's just this.

399
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
It's impossible.

400
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
It's just this.

401
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
It's just this.

402
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
It's impossible.

403
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
It's impossible.

404
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
It's definitely impossible.

405
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
When you go out a little, it's fine.

406
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
But it's okay.

407
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
You're crouching.

408
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
When you go like this, you go like this.

409
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
It's okay.

410
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
You have a lot of willpower.

411
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Until then, you won't be able to crouch.

412
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
If you're not good at it, you'll just come out like this.

413
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
It's definitely impossible.

414
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
It's impossible.

415
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
It's impossible.

416
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
It's okay.

417
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Even if you have a lot of panties,

418
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
it's better than nothing.

419
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
If you don't want to get caught.

420
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Even if you have a lot of panties,

421
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
it's better than nothing.

422
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
It's better than nothing.

423
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Even if you have a lot of panties,

424
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
it's better than nothing.

425
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
What are you talking about?

426
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Senpai Nuguru

427
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Matsumoto-san says that he was a baby for about 10 years after he was born.

428
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
The baby suddenly starts crying,

429
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
but there must be a reason for it.

430
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Matsumoto-san, please solve the mystery of the baby suddenly crying.

431
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
This is a pretty deep story.

432
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I'm sure there's a reason for everything.

433
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I'm sure there is.

434
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I'm sure there is.

435
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Normally babies cry when they're hungry, right?

436
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
No, they don't cry.

437
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Even if you give them food, they suddenly start crying.

438
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
You didn't like it, did you?

439
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
That's right.

440
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
That's a stupid story.

441
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
It's because it's so annoying.

442
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
No one says it's annoying.

443
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
There's a reason for it.

444
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
There's a reason for it.

445
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
There's a reason for it.

446
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Yes, there is.

447
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Please tell me.

448
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,000
The baby cries on the train, right?

449
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
That's because he thinks about a lot of things and gets excited.

450
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
He has a father, a mother, a lunch box,

451
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
tea,

452
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
the scenery on the train is beautiful,

453
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
the mountain is over there,

454
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
That's because he's happy, right?

455
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
That's right.

456
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
That's the reason.

457
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
That's why he gets more and more excited.

458
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,000
That's why he thinks about a lot of things while he's crying.

459
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
He thinks, I feel good now.

460
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I feel comfortable now.

461
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
My father was good too.

462
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I want to live like this forever.

463
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I want to live like this forever.

464
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
But I want to grow up to be an adult one day.

465
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I have to study in elementary school.

466
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I have to leave elementary school.

467
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I have to take part in part-time jobs.

468
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I have to take part in part-time jobs.

469
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
You're a cute boy!

470
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
What the hell are you thinking?

471
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Who said I can't think?

472
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
There's a reason for it.

473
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
He thinks about a lot of things.

474
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
He's like a dog.

475
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
He's like a firefly.

476
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Everyone is like that.

477
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
You think he's crying all of a sudden, don't you?

478
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
But he's not crying all of a sudden. He's crying for a reason.

479
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
No, he's not.

480
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Well, of course, when a strange guy comes, he cries.

481
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Who is this guy? Who is he?

482
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
That's right.

483
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Say it! Say it!

484
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I have to say it?

485
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
What are those pants? What are they?

486
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
So he cries.

487
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
The pants are long!

488
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
He doesn't hate it.

489
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
When he gets hated around here, he gets very angry.

490
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Well, that's how it is.

491
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
That's how it is.

492
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
There are things like that.

493
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Is that so?

494
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Yes.

495
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Please tell us a professional reaction to the moment a black beard came out in a black beard machine game.

496
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Huh?

497
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
It's Kase.

498
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:22,000
This is...

499
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
This is...

500
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
But...

501
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
This is... I want to know too.

502
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Even if you tell me a professional reaction.

503
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
But this is...

504
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I don't know which one will win.

505
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,000
No, I don't care. I want to know your reaction.

506
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Can I do this?

507
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Sure.

508
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Even if you tell me a professional reaction.

509
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Well, it's different from an amateur.

510
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
That's true.

511
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
If you're an amateur, you go like this.

512
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
For example, if you put this in...

513
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
You can't do it with this.

514
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
It's a talking pattern, so it gets in the way.

515
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
But I don't understand it.

516
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I think he'll say something when it goes bang.

517
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
He'll laugh at you.

518
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I don't know.

519
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
It's dangerous.

520
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I don't know what to do.

521
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I think I know what to do.

522
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
This...

523
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
See? I just took it off.

524
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
This is bad.

525
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
You have to do it better.

526
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
That's right.

527
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Even if you tell me, what should I do?

528
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
It's okay. You can use this.

529
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I can use it?

530
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
For example...

531
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
For example...

532
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Let's say you stick it out.

533
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Okay.

534
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
And when you stick it out...

535
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
When it goes bang...

536
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
What kind of reaction will it be?

537
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Let's do it slowly.

538
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
When you stick it out...

539
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
What should I make for dinner tonight?

540
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
You're the one in front of the fish.

541
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
That's too much.

542
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
This is normal.

543
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I'm a professional at reactions.

544
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
But I want to be kind to black beards.

545
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Is it okay to have black beards?

546
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I want to express my feelings.

547
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Is that dangerous?

548
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Let's do it normally.

549
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Let's do it normally.

550
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:44,000
I don't like this.

551
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
This is...

552
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:53,000
This is a professional reaction.

553
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Do you understand?

554
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Black doesn't even make a sound.

555
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
He only pulls his body.

556
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I'm tired!

557
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
It's too early!

558
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
You should have black beards for the third one!

559
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
I don't care! I'm tired!

560
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Please do it properly.

561
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,000
I've done it before.

562
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Like this.

563
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:34,000
But that was the snow Matsumoto Hitoshi.

564
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I want you to see the difference.

565
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
You should have said it first.

566
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
That was the snow Matsumoto Hitoshi.

567
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I felt like I was playing with my family.

568
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
That's why I did it.

569
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,000
I'll do it properly.

570
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I'm scared.

571
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
You should have said it.

572
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Are you okay?

573
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
It's too early!

574
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
That was the snow Matsumoto Hitoshi.

575
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I've done it before.

576
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
That was the snow Matsumoto Hitoshi.

577
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
This time I'll do it with my legs.

578
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Even if I do this...

579
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
I can't do anything.

580
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
It's too early!

581
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
What are you doing?

582
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
It's too early!

583
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
It's strange.

584
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Do it again!

585
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
I want to do it properly.

586
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
That's right.

587
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I'll do it.

588
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
This is scary.

589
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I hate this.

590
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Thank you very much.

591
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Why?

592
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,000
