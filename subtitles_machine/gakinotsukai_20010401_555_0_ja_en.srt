1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Thank you very much!

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Today, the other day...

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
It was the worst!

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
It was the worst project!

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I don't think there's anything worse than this.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
It was short.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
But it was shot diagonally.

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Really!

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
It means that they watched it a lot.

10
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
It seems that they were moved.

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I think my frame will be used up.

12
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Who uses it?

13
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
That's right.

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
When she found out that she was pregnant,

15
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
She finally decided to marry a 33-year-old man.

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Comedian Hosei Yamazaki

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
The other day, a touching performance was held with only relatives.

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Today, we will show you the whole picture!

19
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Let's have the main character, Hosei Yamazaki, come on stage!

20
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Hello!

21
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Hosei Yamazaki

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Why do you have such a face?

23
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Thank you very much!

24
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Why do you have such a face?

25
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Thank you very much!

26
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Are you going to cry?

27
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
If you don't cry,

28
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Human skin...

29
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
It's human skin.

30
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
It's human skin.

31
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
If you cry like this.

32
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
You don't understand, do you?

33
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
It's human skin.

34
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Give me back my frame!

35
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
It's okay, Hamada-san.

36
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
You'll definitely cry.

37
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
It's a human skin.

38
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
It's a human skin.

39
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The size is different.

40
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
It's not a human skin.

41
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
It's about the same size.

42
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
It's definitely not a human skin.

43
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
If you don't cry like this.

44
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
It's so touching.

45
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Today, there are four of us and 25 staff members.

46
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Let's see if it's moving.

47
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
After we're done, let's do the math.

48
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I see.

49
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,000
We'll give Hosei a special gift.

50
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I see.

51
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I think it's this.

52
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
It's a gift for 5 people from 0.

53
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
It's for 5 people.

54
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
That's about it.

55
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
It's for 6 to 10 people.

56
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
It's this.

57
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
It's a gift for 5 people from 0 to 5 people.

58
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
It's a gift for 5 people from 0 to 5 people.

59
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
It's a gift for 5 people from 0 to 5 people.

60
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
You're always like this.

61
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I don't like it.

62
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
11 to 15 people can enjoy a bike with three people.

63
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
16 to 20 people can enjoy a luxury car.

64
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
21 to 24 people can enjoy a luxurious chandelier.

65
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I don't need this.

66
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
It's a wonderful gift.

67
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
It's a gift for 5 people from 0 to 15 people.

68
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
If it's perfect for 25 people, it's this.

69
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
It's a gift for 12 people.

70
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
It's a gift for 12 people.

71
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
It's a gift for 12 people from anywhere in the world.

72
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Really?

73
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Yes.

74
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
You're going to give me all of this?

75
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
This is amazing.

76
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I'm the only one who gets to give you money for a trip to Shizuoka.

77
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Is that true?

78
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
This program is brought to you by the sponsors.

79
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Now we will start the grand opening of Yama-chan's happy wedding.

80
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I can't go down one more time.

81
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I can't go down one more time.

82
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I can't go down one more time.

83
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I can't go down one more time.

84
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
This is the way to do it, right?

85
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Something like this.

86
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:51,000
This is the way to do it, right?

87
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
No one laughs.

88
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Please laugh at the one behind you.

89
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Please.

90
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
No one laughs.

91
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Heisei 13 years old, October 21st.

92
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Husband, Hyousen Yamasaki.

93
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Wife, Aya.

94
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
You talked, didn't you?

95
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I can talk.

96
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
You can't talk.

97
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I can talk.

98
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
What is this?

99
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
It's like crying.

100
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
This is like a wedding how-to video.

101
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
What is this?

102
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
It's a very beautiful image.

103
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
This is a video that looks like this even if you play it in a song.

104
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
It's a lie.

105
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
This is a lie.

106
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
This is a lie.

107
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
This is a lie.

108
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
This is a lie.

109
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
This is a rare scene.

110
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Why?

111
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
You don't cry that much.

112
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I don't cry.

113
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I'm crying, so I can't cry.

114
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Why are you crying?

115
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
You don't cry, do you?

116
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Why are you crying?

117
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
The bride and groom will enter.

118
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
What is this?

119
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
You don't cry, do you?

120
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Why do you enter with such a sound?

121
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:32,000
The bride and groom will enter.

122
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
You are laughing.

123
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:40,000
The bride and groom will enter.

124
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Are you ready?

125
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
The bride and groom will enter.

126
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Congratulations.

127
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
You are laughing.

128
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:02,000
The bride and groom will enter.

129
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,000
The bride and groom will enter.

130
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
The bride and groom will enter.

131
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I'm looking at the bride and groom.

132
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Please pay attention to the screen on the right.

133
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
This is a picture of you two when you were young.

134
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Let's go.

135
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I don't want to see it.

136
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
There was a genius comedian in Nishinomiya City, Hyogo Prefecture.

137
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I told you myself.

138
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Thank you.

139
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:46,000
There is a great symbol of a genius comedian in the lower center.

140
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I'm laughing.

141
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
The bride and groom will enter.

142
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:00,000
The bride and groom will enter.

143
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
This costume is enough.

144
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I'm laughing.

145
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:20,000
The bride and groom will enter.

146
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Congratulations.

147
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
The bride and groom will enter.

148
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:36,000
The bride and groom will enter.

149
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Congratulations.

150
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
The bride and groom have arrived.

151
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
What is this?

152
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I wanted to see this.

153
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Congratulations.

154
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
This is strange.

155
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
What is this?

156
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I don't know what this is.

157
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I think this is a little different from the previous one.

158
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
No, no, no.

159
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
This is fine.

160
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
This is fine.

161
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Wait.

162
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
This is hard for us, too.

163
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
This is really hard for a person who shot at the scene.

164
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
This is hard.

165
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
This is fine.

166
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
What is this?

167
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Who is this?

168
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
What is this?

169
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
You can see it now, right?

170
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Thank you.

171
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
This is a little different from the previous one.

172
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
This is a little different from the previous one.

173
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Why are you wearing this?

174
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I don't care about that.

175
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Dad, mom.

176
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Thank you for raising such a selfish child.

177
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
And mom.

178
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Until I met my current father,

179
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I have been a woman for the rest of my life.

180
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Our father.

181
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
He took care of me.

182
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
What are you talking about?

183
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Mom, thank you for your hard work.

184
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,000
From now on, I will do my best as a mother and a baby.

185
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Mom.

186
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
From the bottom of my heart,

187
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I was born as a mother's child.

188
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I was born as a grandfather.

189
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I am grateful that I was born as a grandmother.

190
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Thank you very much.

191
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
And Hosei's father and mother.

192
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
It's a long story, but

193
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I will do my best as a wife of Hosei Yamato.

194
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Thank you.

195
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Thank you very much.

196
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Congratulations on your birthday.

197
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Please give a round of applause to Hosei Yamato.

198
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Congratulations on your birthday.

199
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,000
That's all.

200
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,000
He is crying alone.

201
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Please tell us what you think.

202
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Hama-san, do you have anything to say?

203
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I think it was a typical wedding ceremony.

204
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
He is smiling.

205
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I don't know.

206
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I don't know if you are impressed.

207
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Please tell us what you think.

208
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
If you are impressed, please turn on the switch.

209
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
It's zero.

210
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Zero?

211
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Really?

212
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Zero?

213
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I didn't think it was zero.

214
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Zero?

215
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
But there is a product, right?

216
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
This is toilet paper.

217
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Unfortunately, it was zero.

218
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Really?

219
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Yes.

220
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I was a little impressed.

221
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:12,000
He is crying on the other side.

222
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:33,000
It's hard.
