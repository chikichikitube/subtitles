1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
It all started from here.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
The genius boy, Yamasaki's idea.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
A match between Wasabi Sushi and Russian Roulette.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
The person who eats the Wasabi Sushi out of the 100 sushi will be penalized.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
The game will continue until one of the downtown people eats the Wasabi Sushi.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Until then, if Yamasaki Kokoriko doesn't eat the Wasabi Sushi, he'll be safe.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Safe!

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
And then, Yamasaki's 6th turn.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Come on.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Don't shoot in the middle.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
What?

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
That's enough.

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Tanaka, choose.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Safe?

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Safe.

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It's probably safe.

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
It's safe.

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
What are you doing?

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Don't be stupid.

20
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
What?

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
What?

22
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
It's safe!

23
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
It's safe!

24
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
It's safe!

25
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
First, Yamasaki, the inventor, is eliminated.

26
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
After that, the rules are changed.

27
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
The four of them will eat the sushi at the same time.

28
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Ready, set, go.

29
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Okay.

30
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
What?

31
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
What?

32
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Safe?

33
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Safe.

34
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
It's safe.

35
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
It's safe.

36
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
What?

37
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Tanaka?

38
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
What?

39
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Finally, Tanaka is eliminated.

40
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Ready, set, go.

41
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I don't know.

42
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
What?

43
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
What?

44
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I'm safe.

45
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
End safe?

46
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
End safe?

47
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Matsumoto is safe.

48
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Wait.

49
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
It's safe.

50
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
It's safe!

51
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Yes!

52
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Now, Hamada, Yamasaki, and Tanaka

53
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
The punishment game for the threeæ‰¾ are decided.

54
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
What the contents are

55
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Last time, the commercial home that they suffered

56
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
It's more difficult than the hot springs that Z prosperity

57
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Is great.

58
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
It's a 5 minute car wash!

59
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
In the midst of a harsh situation where they can't laugh at all, the comedians are attacked.

60
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
If they laugh, a severe punishment will be executed.

61
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I was really looking forward to it.

62
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
This hellish punishment game will be even more scale-up under the management of Matsumoto Produce.

63
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
A one-night, two-day trip to a hot spring that you should never laugh at, in Yugawara.

64
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Tonight, we'll show you the highlights.

65
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
On the day of the punishment game, the three of them arrive at the hot spring town of Yugawara.

66
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
In this town, a harsh punishment game will be executed.

67
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
And soon, the first trial of the punishment game will begin.

68
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Everyone in the town is welcoming us.

69
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Look.

70
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
This is bad.

71
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
They're raising the town.

72
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
This is amazing.

73
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
What exactly did the three of them see?

74
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
What exactly did they see?

75
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Furthermore, a mysterious wrestler appears as if to chase them.

76
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
What? We've arrived in Yugawara.

77
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
One, two, three.

78
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Disqualified, disqualified, disqualified, disqualified, disqualified.

79
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Disqualified, disqualified, disqualified.

80
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
This is amazing.

81
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
What exactly did the three mysterious wrestlers see?

82
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
As soon as they took a rest, the three of them got on a taxi and moved.

83
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Of course, on the way...

84
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Yamasaki.

85
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
This is bad.

86
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Who's going to get on the taxi?

87
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
They'll laugh at this.

88
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
They'll definitely laugh at this.

89
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,000
On the way to the inn, the three of them visit a temple.

90
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:54,000
On the way to the inn, the three of them visit a temple.

91
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:02,000
On the way to the inn, the three of them visit a temple.

92
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
What exactly did the priest say?

93
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Finally, the three of them arrive at the inn.

94
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:23,000
The three of them are attacked by other wrestlers.

95
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Hamada, you're out.

96
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Stop it. Stop it.

97
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I can't do this. I'm a grown-up.

98
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Hamada is addicted to comedy.

99
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
This time, a large number of guests appear as a role model for comedy.

100
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
That popular young duo.

101
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
What is it?

102
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
What is it?

103
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I'll do my best.

104
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
And that gravure queen.

105
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,000
And that gravure queen.

106
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:40,000
And that gravure queen.

107
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:51,000
And that gravure queen.

108
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
And that gravure queen.

109
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Black glasses.

110
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:10,000
And that gravure queen.

111
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Actually, Hollywood stars are staying here today.

112
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
What?

113
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
They want to say hello to people like you, so I'll be surprised.

114
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Here you are.

115
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Is it a secret date until that big Hollywood star comes?

116
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I'm getting goosebumps.

117
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
At the New York Times, which soothes the tiredness of the day, comedy traps attack.

118
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
What exactly happened to the three of them?

119
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:27,000
And this time, Matsumoto himself is the strongest candidate.

120
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:39,000
And this time, Matsumoto himself is the strongest candidate.

121
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Hamada, Yamasaki, Tanaka, out.

122
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:49,000
And this time, Matsumoto himself is the strongest candidate.

123
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Hamada, Yamasaki, Tanaka, out.

124
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:02,000
And this time, Matsumoto himself is the strongest candidate.

125
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
What the hell are you doing?

126
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Get out of here!

127
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
At the night show, which was held at midnight, comedy traps attack.

128
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
What are you doing?

129
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:31,000
The big star of the Showa era came to Yugawara.

130
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:48,000
In addition, the nostalgic brother Ryo is also enthusiastic.

131
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
The comedy traps attack one after another.

132
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Can the three of them stand it?

133
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:01,000
At the bedside, which was finally about to fall asleep.

134
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Hamada, Yamasaki, out.

135
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
What happened to Yamasaki, who was attacked by a cat?

136
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Can the three of them successfully complete the punishment game?

137
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
What the hell are you doing?

138
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:01,000
This show will be on air for two hours from 9.30 pm on December 28th.

139
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
That's amazing.

140
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
That's amazing.

141
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
It's been a long time since we talked.

142
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I went to a place like a cherry blossom garden by myself.

143
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
By yourself?

144
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Yes, I went there by myself.

145
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
What's the smell?

146
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
It's an elevator.

147
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I'm aiming for the first floor.

148
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
That's right.

149
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I'm alone from the 7th floor.

150
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I went to the 6th floor.

151
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
A woman like the back of a child came.

152
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
A woman like the back of a child and a woman like the front of a child came.

153
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I've never seen the back of a child.

154
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I saw it when I was running.

155
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
A woman like the back of a child and a woman like the front of a child came.

156
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Separately?

157
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
They're friends.

158
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
A woman like the back of a child and a woman like the front of a child came.

159
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
A woman like the back of a child...

160
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I don't know which one.

161
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
A woman like the back of a child.

162
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
If I push the button.

163
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
A woman like the back of a child will say no.

164
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I said it's the 4th floor.

165
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:36,000
A woman like the back of a child will say yes and so the button has already been pressed.

166
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I can't help you, can't I?

167
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
It was too hard because I was feeling in a relationship with the back of a child.

168
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
in the 4th, 3rd, and 6th time

169
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I don't care about that

170
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Apologize!

171
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,500
I don't care about that

172
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,000
Why do you apologize?

173
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
In the end, I'm always the idiot

174
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Who's the idiot?

175
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Who's the idiot?

176
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,500
It's just a little thing

177
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,500
There are idiots

178
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,000
I don't care about that

179
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
There are idiots

180
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
There are idiots

181
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I've been hearing that for a while

182
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
What kind of idiot?

183
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I've been hearing that for a while

184
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Behind me

185
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
There were two girls and two boys

186
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
There were four of them

187
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
They were talking like a bunch of idiots

188
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
That's good

189
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I thought they were idiots

190
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
But that was good

191
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I'm so full!

192
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
You should say that

193
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I'm so full!

194
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I can't bear it

195
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I'm so full!

196
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
All four of them

197
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
But don't you want to eat ojiya?

198
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I thought I wanted to eat ojiya

199
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I want to eat it

200
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Do you want to eat ojiya?

201
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Let's eat it!

202
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Excuse me

203
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Can you prepare ojiya?

204
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I can make ojiya

205
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I can do it

206
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
How many people should we serve?

207
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Let's see

208
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Four people

209
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Four people

210
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
That's impossible!

211
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
One person can only serve one person

212
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
One person can only serve one person

213
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
What kind of world is ojiya?

214
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
It's not a family restaurant!

215
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Shut up

216
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I'm full!

217
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Shut up!

218
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I'm so full!

219
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
You should say that

220
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I'm so full!

221
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,000
But my ojiya and the ojiya at the restaurant are the same

222
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I'm so full!

223
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I'm going to start walking

224
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I'm going to start walking

225
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
What's that?

226
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I'm going to start walking

227
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I'm going to start walking

228
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Come on

229
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:10,000
He is a man of the sea who was fishing for octopus and squid

230
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
He is a man of the sea who was fishing for octopus and squid

231
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:19,000
The other day you met something unexpected while scuba diving in Okinawa

232
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Tell me about that

233
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
You don't do scuba diving, do you?

234
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I don't

235
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
When you do it you encounter many things

236
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Really?

237
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Yes

238
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
That's amazing

239
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Why don't you do scuba diving?

240
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Because my ears hurt

241
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
You're fast

242
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
You're quick

243
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Really?

244
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I don't understand unexpected things

245
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
You don't do scuba diving

246
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I saw almost everything

247
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
What did you see?

248
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I saw almost everything

249
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
What did you see?

250
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Everything

251
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Are you going to tell me everything?

252
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
For example

253
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
For example, a supermarket

254
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
What does it say?

255
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Aisai-go

256
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Aisai-go? A washing machine?

257
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
A washing machine

258
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
A washing machine is fine

259
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
What?

260
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
A washing machine

261
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I knew that it was Aisai-go

262
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I could say it was a washing machine

263
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
You should have told me

264
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
All of it

265
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
What I'm saying is

266
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Don't put everything in the sea

267
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I see

268
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I see

269
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Don't put everything in the sea

270
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Where are you diving?

271
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
In Okinawa

272
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I'm in Okinawa

273
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I'm in Okinawa

274
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I'm in Okinawa

275
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Really?

276
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
What else did you see?

277
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I'll tell you everything

278
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
You could have told me 3 or 4 things

279
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
A lid

280
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
A lid?

281
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
You're so annoying

282
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
You're so stupid

283
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
You have so many lids

284
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
You have so many lids

285
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I don't like going into the sea

286
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
What do you mean?

287
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
If a kid sees you, he'll be surprised

288
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Really?

289
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I like the tropical fish

290
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
There are so many tropical fish in Okinawa

291
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
What?

292
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
There are so many tropical fish in Okinawa

293
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I'm walking on two legs

294
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I'm walking like this

295
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
What is this?

296
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I'm growing up

297
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
You're about the same age as me

298
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Run away

299
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Run away?

300
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
What are you doing?

301
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
What are you doing?

302
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
There's more over there

303
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,000
There's a blue one over there

304
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
It's yellow

305
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
That's funny

306
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
It's amazing

307
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
It's yellow and it's growing

308
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Tell me

309
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
There's a blue one over there

310
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:20,000
It's the same blue one as me

311
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I heard that the human body has a part called the human body

312
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
What part of the human body is that?

313
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Around here

314
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:47,000
From here to here

315
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
That's a lot of space

316
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
That's a lot of space

317
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
No, don't put it here

318
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Put it here

319
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Like this

320
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Why is it like that?

321
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
If you say it like this

322
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Like this

323
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
It's like this

324
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
It's like this

325
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Why is it called the human body?

326
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Do I have to talk about that?

327
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Of course

328
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
This is the first time everyone knows

329
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
This is called the human body

330
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Don't say it like this

331
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Like this

332
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
This is the human body

333
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Like this

334
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,000
No, if you go that far it's called the human body

335
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Even Wakisaka-san is included

336
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
This is the human body

337
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
If you say it like this it's Wakisaka-san

338
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
This is the human body

339
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Just a little bit of Wakisaka-san

340
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
It's usually the human body

341
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Why is it called the human body?

342
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,000
You think it has my name on it right?

343
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Yes

344
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
That's strange

345
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
This is from the name of Matsumoto-san

346
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
You're wrong

347
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Before I was born

348
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:11,000
The human body part was from the name

349
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
That's shallow

350
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
So my father

351
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Told me to become like this

352
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
To become a child like this

353
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
That's why it's called the human body

354
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
You don't understand why it's called the human body

355
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I don't understand that

356
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I understand that

357
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
That's right

358
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
There are many theories

359
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Don't say that

360
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
There are many theories

361
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
What about this one?

362
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
What do you call this one?

363
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Does it have a name?

364
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
It's the face on the left

365
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
This is the only one

366
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
That's right

367
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Didn't you say something about it?

368
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
What did I say?

369
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
This is a question for Matsumoto-san

370
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Who lives in a mysterious world

371
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Matsumoto-san, one morning

372
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
When you woke up, you were Matsumoto-san

373
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
What were you like before you became Matsumoto-san?

374
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
There are things like that

375
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
How old were you?

376
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
When I was 4

377
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
When I met you, I was already Matsumoto-san

378
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
That's right

379
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
What did you do before you were 4?

380
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
That's right

381
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
But when I talk about this

382
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
It takes a long time

383
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
What did you do before you were 4?

384
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
It's a simple question

385
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
It's not long

386
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Before I was 4, I did this

387
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
After I say this, it's over

388
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
It's not a story that takes that long

389
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
That's right

390
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Why are you talking like that?

391
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
It was that morning

392
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
That morning, I became Matsumoto-san

393
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
It wasn't until Wednesday

394
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I became Matsumoto-san on Thursday

395
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I see

396
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
It's not, it's Monday

397
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Monday is fine

398
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Wait a minute, was it Monday?

399
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
No, it's Thursday

400
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Then it's Thursday

401
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
It's Thursday

402
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Let's be surprised, it's completely different from Wednesday

403
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
That's right

404
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Then it's Monday

405
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Monday is fine

406
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
It's the next Monday after Thursday

407
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
It's fine, either way is fine

408
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
I don't know

409
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Then it's Thursday

410
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Then what did you do until Wednesday?

411
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
I became Western

412
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Ah, it's not

413
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
It's Monday

414
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
It's Monday, what did you do?

415
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
What is Western?

416
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,000
I don't know, you said Western

417
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Do you know laughing?

418
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
What do you mean?

419
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
If you say something that is too far away, it won't come right away

420
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
This is a good example of Western

421
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I don't know

422
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
There is a sense of humor

423
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Whether you can see it or not, it's just right

424
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
That's the best way to laugh

425
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
If it's too close, it will be blurry

426
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
If it's too close, it will be blurry

427
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
It will be like that

428
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
If it's too far away, it will be like that

429
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
It's best to be in a position that you can see

430
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,000
It's best to be in a position that you can see

431
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
It's best to be in a position that you can see

432
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
It won't float

433
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
You can drink it if you want

434
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
The 3 people's punishment game will be released

435
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
The two-day trip to the onsen that you can't laugh at

436
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
This time it's amazing

437
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Matsumoto stands in the way of the punishment

438
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
That's why I'm laughing

439
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:40,000
