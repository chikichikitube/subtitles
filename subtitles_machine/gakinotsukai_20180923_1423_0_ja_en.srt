00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
This week's guest is...

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Nadal's 24 hour long interview, the final episode!

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
During my break, I run around like this

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
And I see my shoes running off my feet

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I run like this

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
In his childhood, he was bullied

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I would go to the toilet and find my shoes

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I was really famous

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
The school days when he was a student who wanted to be a school nurse

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I wanted to be a fishmonger, especially in the aquarium

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Speaking of your father, what is the thing that you have in your house?

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I said it's impossible

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I said it's impossible

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
You're scared?

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I said it's impossible

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Tonight, the bad comedian, Konochi-kun Nadaru, is naked!

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Eh, he's so red!

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
He's dead!

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
It's 8.26pm.

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
He takes his tired-looking Nadaru to a restaurant to have dinner.

21
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Nadaru-san, this is your favorite restaurant, right?

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Yes, I always bring my juniors here.

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Ah, really?

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:15,500
Yes.

25
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,000
What kind of restaurant is it?

26
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:17,500
Link.

27
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:18,900
Yes?

28
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:22,200
Link.

29
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:24,800
What do you recommend?

30
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Mentaiko pasta.

31
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,000
Mentaiko pasta is really good.

32
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,200
Is it an Italian restaurant?

33
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:33,800
Well...

34
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:36,600
European.

35
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,200
European?

36
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:39,900
What?

37
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:41,100
I don't know much about it.

38
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,800
It's not that special.

39
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,000
There's also a French restaurant.

40
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:44,900
Yes.

41
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:48,900
It's a European style Western food.

42
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:56,900
I want to tell the viewers that they can expect anything.

43
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,900
I understand.

44
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:00,900
Please wait a moment.

45
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:02,900
I don't know what to say.

46
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:06,900
What should I say?

47
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,900
It's pasta.

48
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,900
It's a half-baked pasta.

49
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,900
It's like Capricciosa.

50
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:18,900
Capricciosa...

51
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,900
Well, that kind of...

52
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,900
It's a bar.

53
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:26,900
A bar?

54
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:28,900
A bar like Capricciosa?

55
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:35,900
And then, NADAL arrives at the Italian bar in Nakameguro, Rink.

56
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,900
It's a very fashionable place.

57
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,900
Yes, it is.

58
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:46,900
Let's try the recommended Tarako pasta.

59
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:51,900
This is the back side menu for the regular Nadal.

60
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:54,900
This is really delicious.

61
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:55,900
Really?

62
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:56,900
I'm sure.

63
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,900
You're a special person, Nadal.

64
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:01,900
The way you eat is like a tea.

65
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,900
It's so hard to cut it

66
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,900
The shape is so hard

67
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:09,900
It's better to cut it like this

68
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:13,900
If you were to describe this, it would be like a crepe

69
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,900
First of all, the texture is completely different

70
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:18,900
It's chewy

71
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,900
This is raw pasta right?

72
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:21,900
It's not raw

73
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:22,900
It's different

74
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,900
Why is it like this?

75
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:30,900
Of course, the interview continues here.

76
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:34,900
I think that the comedians are also respected.

77
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:37,900
Do you think Nadal is winning here?

78
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:40,900
I think he is winning in terms of the humor that comes down.

79
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:46,900
He is not winning in terms of sense and self-expression.

80
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:50,900
That's cool as a comedian, but when it comes down to the humor,

81
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:55,900
Sometimes, something terrible happens.

82
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,900
What about you, Mr. Hamada?

83
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:01,900
I think everything Mr. Hamada says is funny.

84
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,900
That's why I'm not good at it.

85
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,900
I'm not good at it.

86
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:07,900
I can get both answers.

87
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,900
I can get both answers.

88
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,900
I can get both answers.

89
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:19,900
I think there are few people who can simply laugh at me.

90
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:21,900
You're making fun of me.

91
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:23,900
I'm sorry.

92
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:27,900
I saw Hama-chan.

93
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,900
Hama-chan was shopping.

94
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:31,900
I bought it.

95
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:35,900
Naderu appeared in the shopping video of Hama-chan.

96
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:39,900
He bought a certain product in the program with his own money.

97
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,900
What is it?

98
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,900
What did you buy?

99
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:47,900
This is an iron. It's very good quality.

100
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,900
You're using it now too.

101
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,900
What? You're using it?

102
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:00,900
Iron.

103
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,900
It's very good quality.

104
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,900
Do you use it often?

105
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:05,900
Yes, I do.

106
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,900
I got it from Hamada.

107
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,900
It's called iron.

108
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:15,900
Naderu ordered carbonara

109
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,900
What is this? Look at the camera

110
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:23,900
That's dirty

111
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:26,900
I don't like this

112
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:27,900
You're losing

113
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:30,900
He was very serious

114
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:31,900
You're losing

115
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:33,900
What is this?

116
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,900
You're losing

117
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:38,900
You're making a difference

118
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:42,900
Like a beast, he swallows up the pasta.

119
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,900
I'll finish the food.

120
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:50,900
It's huge.

121
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,900
It's not as deep as in Shibuya.

122
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,900
The pasta is really good.

123
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,900
I'll finish it at the end.

124
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:12,900
The place was moved to the theater in Shibuya and we heard the story of the situation two years ago.

125
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:17,900
How did you feel when you actually came to Tokyo?

126
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:23,900
I think it was good to come. I didn't have any job at all.

127
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:28,900
I came to Tokyo and did a lot of work. I think I gained a lot of experience.

128
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:33,900
Among all the jobs you've done, which one was the most enjoyable?

129
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:38,900
There might not be any shows I enjoyed.

130
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,900
Why is that?

131
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,900
Because they're all battles.

132
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:56,900
And the comedian who is active in private, was chosen by the audition and formed the Nadaru army.

133
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:57,900
Yes.

134
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:04,900
He listens to what I say a lot, he is kind.

135
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:06,900
He is kind.

136
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:11,900
The NADAL army was chosen based on kindness.

137
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:14,900
Actually, there was a member who was in the first group.

138
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:19,900
Originally, it was Yurian and Assei who were in the NADAL army.

139
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:24,900
I didn't listen to them much, so I just took the initiative.

140
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:27,900
You got so popular?

141
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,900
You got so popular that you didn't have time.

142
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:34,900
It was 11.45 pm.

143
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:38,900
After returning to the hotel, he continues his interview.

144
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:43,900
13 hours have passed. How do you feel about looking back at this time?

145
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:48,900
I want to do my best.

146
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:53,900
Yes, the battle is still at the turning point.

147
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:57,900
He is trying to regain his energy and answers the interview.

148
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:00,900
By the way, what is the NG item?

149
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,900
I think it's about family.

150
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:04,900
And...

151
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,900
I don't want to be a laughing stock.

152
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:10,900
You've heard of the Japanese word for a Japanese person, right?

153
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,900
What do you remember it as?

154
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:15,900
I think it's something like, I said something good.

155
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,900
Like, you're a good person?

156
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:18,900
Yes.

157
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:21,900
I think it's something like that.

158
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:25,900
I think it's something about my ability.

159
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:27,900
Something interesting.

160
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:30,900
Is that impression good?

161
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:35,900
I want to talk but I really don't have anything.

162
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:37,900
I only have this much.

163
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:40,900
I've only been in the toilet and talked to Nicoyaka.

164
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:45,900
Even so, the interview doesn't end.

165
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:48,900
For Nanaru-san,

166
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:50,900
You're getting excited.

167
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:59,900
It's not something that you can't do without, but it would be nice if it existed.

168
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:02,900
If it existed.

169
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:05,900
It's annoying.

170
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:06,900
Amazing!

171
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:12,900
That's cool!

172
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:22,900
At 1 am, he moves to a hotel bar and approaches Nadal's love.

173
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:27,900
Love, huh?

174
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:29,900
How do you drink it?

175
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:31,900
I'll just drink it as I like.

176
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:32,900
What are you drinking?

177
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,900
How can you be cheating?

178
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:37,900
How can you be cheating?

179
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,900
You can't say something cool.

180
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,900
If I become a city...

181
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,900
If your heart moves a little...

182
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,900
Is your girlfriend here now?

183
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:49,900
She is.

184
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,900
How did you meet her?

185
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:53,900
We were just talking.

186
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:56,900
While looking at the cherry blossoms on Meguro River...

187
00:09:56,900 --> 00:10:00,900
I have something to say to you.

188
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:04,900
I like you a little.

189
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:08,900
I would be happy if we could date.

190
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:13,900
If we could go to the same place again...

191
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:16,900
Don't drink it here.

192
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:18,900
I would be happy.

193
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:01,780
You're a bit of a

194
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,900
You're a bit of a

195
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,900
It's a bit too much.

196
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:30,900
Madaru is happy with his love story.

197
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:32,900
You drank a lot.

198
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:33,900
Are you okay?

199
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:34,900
I'm fine.

200
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:35,900
You look different.

201
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:36,900
Are you okay?

202
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:39,900
He drinks up the cocktail at once.

203
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:47,900
The next day, he's drinking a cocktail like a tea.

204
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:51,900
He's drinking like a tea.

205
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:55,900
You've been drinking cocktails like tea.

206
00:10:55,900 --> 00:11:00,900
He's drinking like a tea.

207
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:04,900
I'm not drinking.

208
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,900
It's scary!

209
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,900
Why do you say that?

210
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:14,900
What's wrong?

211
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:17,900
That's how humans are.

212
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,900
This is scary.

213
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:21,900
What's wrong?

214
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:23,900
What?

215
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,900
Hey, come back!

216
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:35,900
It's 2 o'clock in the evening.

217
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,900
It's still 2 o'clock!

218
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:42,900
After enjoying the bar, he had an interview in his room.

219
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:47,900
15 hours have passed since you started.

220
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:48,900
Yeah, really.

221
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,900
How do you feel?

222
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:56,900
I was a little drunk, but I was able to drink.

223
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:58,900
Thank you.

224
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:11,900
Is there an ideal way to leave the group?

225
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:15,900
If I don't accept it, I want to quit.

226
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:20,900
I don't want to do it while being told that I don't like the jokes.

227
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:25,900
It's the ideal way to go.

228
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:28,900
Please tell me about the ideal way to go.

229
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,900
If I don't accept it at all.

230
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,900
It's the ideal way.

231
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:37,900
This is the ideal way to go.

232
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:41,900
The ideal way to go.

233
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:45,900
Is it because of the alcohol?

234
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:49,900
The interviewer's question and Nadal's answer are not the same.

235
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,900
And...

236
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:57,900
What do you want to do after retirement?

237
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:59,900
This is bad.

238
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:04,900
Nadal-san?

239
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:11,900
I want to make you a real man in 24 hours.

240
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,900
Can you answer me more seriously?

241
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:15,900
It's SFX.

242
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:22,900
Nadaru-san.

243
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:24,900
Hey.

244
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:27,900
I thought I was going to die.

245
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:28,900
Nadaru-san.

246
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,900
Nadal-san.

247
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:35,900
What do you want to do after retirement?

248
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,900
Nadal-san?

249
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:49,900
Nadal-san?

250
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,900
Scary, scary, scary.

251
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:53,900
Scary, scary, scary.

252
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,900
Scary, scary, scary.

253
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,900
You're a devil, you're a devil.

254
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:58,900
You're a devil.

255
00:13:58,900 --> 00:13:59,900
You're a devil.

256
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:00,900
You're a devil.

257
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:01,900
You're a devil.

258
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:10,900
What?

259
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:12,900
Did you get it?

260
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:13,900
Now?

261
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:17,900
16 hours from the start.

262
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:21,900
A body screaming.

263
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,900
It's so sad.

264
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:27,900
Mr. Nadal?

265
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:31,900
Finally, he's attacked.

266
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,900
Mr. Nadal, please keep your eyes open.

267
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:40,900
His eyes are red.

268
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,900
He's bleeding.

269
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,900
He's bleeding.

270
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:46,900
How will Nadal survive?

271
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:50,900
What is the most memorable moment after the foundation of this company?

272
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:53,900
I think it's winning the King of the World Cup.

273
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:57,900
What is the thing you are most grateful for?

274
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:00,900
When I said I wanted to quit, he stopped me with all his might.

275
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,900
If he hadn't stopped me, I wouldn't have said it.

276
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:08,900
And in the shower, he witnessed a unique way of washing his hair.

277
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:11,900
What are you doing? Stop it!

278
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:13,900
Stop it!

279
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:15,900
You're the one who should stop it!

280
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:21,900
When did you get your first prize?

281
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:25,900
Yesterday, at the first live show.

282
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:27,900
It was two years ago.

283
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,900
Pikachu, who shoots 100,000 volts.

284
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:33,900
Pikachu!

285
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:36,900
It's a gyro-type...

286
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:37,900
This is a gyro-type?

287
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:38,900
What is this?

288
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:39,900
What is this?

289
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:40,900
What is this?

290
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:42,900
I'm going to win.

291
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:48,900
Nadal fights against Suima and continues to fight.

292
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,900
Hello.

293
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,900
Thank you for coming.

294
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:19,900
We have some questions for you, so please answer them.

295
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:25,900
Questions for Nadal!

296
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:33,900
Please ask them!

297
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,900
Me?

298
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:40,900
Your face is so puffy

299
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,900
I'll take it

300
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:48,900
What do you think is the rank of Yappezo in the gag ranking?

301
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:52,900
Also, what is the gag that is just above and below?

302
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,900
It's really below Yappezo

303
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,900
I really can't take it

304
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,900
You have a temper, right?

305
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:07,900
It's about 200 yen. The top is Hi Oppa Pee. The bottom is... What is it?

306
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:09,900
What is it?

307
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:12,900
You won for that.

308
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:13,900
Let's go to the next question.

309
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,900
Everyone will draw anyway.

310
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:22,900
What do you pay attention to when you drink with a woman?

311
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:25,120
I definitely check if the underage is a

312
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:27,120
I'll check the air.

313
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:29,120
Thank you.

314
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,120
Let's go.

315
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,120
Don't be so nice.

316
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,120
Please tell me about the Inaba's relics.

317
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,120
I don't want to.

318
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,120
Why are you so mean?

319
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,120
I don't want to.

320
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,120
Please tell me about the Inaba's relics.

321
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,120
I don't want to.

322
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,120
I told you.

323
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,120
I'm scared.

324
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:54,120
I said no.

325
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,120
I said no.

326
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,120
What is this?

327
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,120
I said no.

328
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:04,120
I said no.

329
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:07,120
The remaining time is 2 hours and a half.

330
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,120
The staff is exhausted.

331
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:13,120
And of course, Nadal.

332
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,120
That's amazing.

333
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:16,120
NADARU-SAN

334
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,120
Huh?

335
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:22,120
Please analyze the reason why Japan is called the Belgium.

336
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,120
Yeah.

337
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,120
NADARU-SAN

338
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,120
NADARU-SAN

339
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,120
NADARU-SAN

340
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:31,120
Hey, your voice is too loud!

341
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,120
NADARU-SAN

342
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,120
What's that?

343
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,120
You sound like a Japanese.

344
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,120
What's that?

345
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,120
NADARU-SAN

346
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,120
Huh?

347
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,120
NADARU-SAN

348
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,120
NADARU-SAN

349
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,120
What's going on?

350
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,120
NADARU-SAN

351
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:57,120
NADAL-san, please analyze the reason why Japan lost to Belgium.

352
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:02,120
Mr. Nadal?

353
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:10,120
Mr. Nadal?

354
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,120
Mr. Nadal?

355
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,120
One more person?

356
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:22,120
Let's do the last part.

357
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,120
What the hell is this interview?

358
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:30,120
The goal of the 24 hours of battle is right there

359
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:36,120
Megwin awakens the body with the AO drink

360
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:43,120
And the time of fate is coming

361
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:46,120
24 hours have passed

362
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,120
Thank you

363
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,120
Have you done anything?

364
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,120
Nothing

365
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,120
I don't have any.

366
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:59,120
NADARU answers 3126 questions in 24 hours.

367
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:02,120
This is the last question.

368
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:06,120
What was your life like?

369
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:11,120
I think I had a lot of ups and downs.

370
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:15,120
But I think I had a good life.

371
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:23,120
I want to work harder to have a better life.

372
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:30,120
You have completed the 20 hours.

373
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,120
Thank you.

374
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,120
I'm glad.

375
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,120
I'm happy.

376
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:40,120
What kind of reaction do you have?

377
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,120
I'm not happy at all.

378
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,120
I'm really...

379
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:46,120
I'm really...

380
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:50,120
I can't do it anymore

381
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:53,120
Good morning

382
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,120
We have a 24 hour interview

383
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,120
We have a 24 hour interview

384
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:58,120
There is a line that is interesting in Nadal's answer

385
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:00,120
There is a line that is interesting in Nadal's answer

386
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,120
Please

387
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,120
Who is it?

388
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,120
Hello

389
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,120
Thank you

390
00:21:08,120 --> 00:20:55,120
I'm a man who was

391
00:20:55,120 --> 00:21:00,120
I'm calling this person because there is something that interests him about the answer.

392
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,120
Please.

393
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,120
Hello.

394
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,120
Thank you very much.

395
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:00,140
He is a man who was

396
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:15,120
Absolutely not allowed to laugh. American police 24 hours.

397
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:21,120
DVD and Blu-ray will be released on November 28th.

398
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,120
Was there a lie?

399
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,120
There were lies.

400
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,120
I thought there were lies.

401
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:33,120
But the first thing that shocked me was the story.

402
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:36,120
I really did everything.

403
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:38,120
You didn't say that?

404
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,120
You said half and half.

405
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,120
I said half and half.

406
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:46,120
I've never done a story in the 7 years of Nadaru.

407
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:51,120
I'm doing half and half for the story.

408
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:54,120
We talked and did it together.

409
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,120
You said you were half-half.

410
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,120
I did.

411
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,120
What? I didn't say I was half-half.

412
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,120
You did.

413
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,120
I did.

414
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,120
I'll confirm it again. I said I was half-half.

415
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,120
You did.

416
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,120
I thought you were being conscious.

417
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:13,120
You said it in the beginning.

418
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,120
When I answered it correctly.

419
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:19,120
And Hamada-san's Hama-chan.

420
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,120
You said you bought an iron, right?

421
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,120
I remember you had an empty box.

422
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,120
Yes, I did.

423
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:28,120
You bought another item besides the iron.

424
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:30,120
A washlet.

425
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:37,120
You bought a washlet that cost about 24,000 yen.

426
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,120
I'm sorry, Hamada-san.

427
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:41,120
I was really surprised.

428
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:44,120
You have a toilet outlet, right?

429
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:46,120
I don't have one at home.

430
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:48,120
I couldn't use a washlet because you bought it for me.

431
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:50,120
So I said, let's change the iron.

432
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:52,120
And it happened.

433
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,120
Change the iron?

434
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:58,120
I bought the iron and the oshiret, but I don't know what the iron change is.

435
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:00,120
What happened?

436
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:06,120
I returned it, and the new iron...

437
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:08,120
I got it.

438
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:10,120
You got it?

439
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:12,120
You changed it to iron?

440
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,120
I changed the oshiret to iron, but I didn't say anything.

441
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:19,120
E? E? E? E? E?

442
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,120
You are scary

443
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:27,120
Very scary

444
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:30,120
Scary

445
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:35,120
Scary

446
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:39,120
You are Cream

447
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,120
I'm a bit different from Porto.

448
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,120
He's a bad guy.

449
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:46,120
I don't know if you can see it, but we're both a bit...

450
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:48,120
Porto is scary.

451
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:50,120
No, it's a one-night trip.

452
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,120
It's a hot spring.

453
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:58,120
If you go in the hot spring, you'll get a bubble.

454
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:00,120
You can do it!

455
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,120
You can do it!

456
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,120
You can do it!

457
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,080
Ah, ah, senpai!
