1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Girls! Come in!

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:11,000
For the last episode of Downtown, Yamazaki was going to ask the yakuza to play with him

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
But the yakuza came out

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:27,000
The yakuza didn't like the way he looked, but Yamazaki prepared a new setup

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Where are you going?

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm really sorry about the other day

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
You didn't like it the other day

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Where are you going?

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Today we have young people

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
It's a disco

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
You're going to play disco?

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Is it fun?

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
It's fun, come in

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Really?

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
It's really fun

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Downtown Senpai, Dancing with Disco Gals

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
This program is brought to you by these sponsors

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
There's no audience

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
It's okay

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
There's no audience

21
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Do you want to play?

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Show us

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
There's no audience

24
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I don't like this

25
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
It's okay, we've called them

26
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
It's like this

27
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
You're lonely

28
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'm not lonely

29
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
You're an idiot

30
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
What are you talking about?

31
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Are you thirsty?

32
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I'm not thirsty, I'm fine

33
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Hey! Nocchi!

34
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Let me go, you idiot

35
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
You have a bad mouth

36
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Don't call me an idiot

37
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm sorry

38
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I'm sorry too

39
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Thank you

40
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Let me go

41
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
He's definitely drunk

42
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Let's toast

43
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Cheers!

44
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Let's have fun today

45
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
It's about time

46
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Today too

47
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
This side

48
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
You called me an old lady the other day

49
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I did

50
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Today too

51
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Come on

52
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
There are four girls

53
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
There are four girls?

54
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Ikeike?

55
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Ikeike has four girls

56
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Ikeike has four girls

57
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I'm looking forward to it

58
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
You can't say harsh things

59
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
More than 50 points

60
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I only say 60 to 70 points

61
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
That's good

62
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I'll dance

63
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Please watch my reactions

64
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Hey everyone!

65
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Young girls, come on!

66
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Come on, come on, come on, come on, kick it!

67
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
She's here

68
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
She's a witch

69
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
She's laughing

70
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
She's a witch

71
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
She's a witch

72
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
The glasses behind her are really ugly

73
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Her glasses are really ugly

74
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Okay

75
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
She's a ***

76
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Hey!

77
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
What's this? 60 to 70 points?

78
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Yes, 60 to 70 points

79
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Her body is really big

80
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
You're a life-threatening woman

81
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Today, since Dan-dan is here

82
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Let's have fun!

83
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
What's your name?

84
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
What's your name?

85
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Mitsuyo

86
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Mitsuyo

87
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
What's this?

88
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
It's candy

89
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
This is bad

90
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
This is bad

91
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Candy is bad

92
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
This is...

93
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
What is it?

94
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
This is...

95
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
You dropped something weird

96
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
It's not weird

97
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I'm Hiroko

98
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Oh, you changed your hairstyle

99
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I'm a player

100
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
It's your first time

101
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
You look like a housewife

102
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Okay, let's start

103
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
The game is over

104
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I can't say anything

105
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
It's okay

106
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Okay, let's start with Hamada

107
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Okay, Matsumoto

108
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Who will be the king?

109
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Everyone, pull

110
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Everyone, pull

111
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Who is the king?

112
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Me!

113
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
The 8th gyaru and...

114
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Matsumoto will kiss

115
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Who is the 8th gyaru?

116
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Who is the 8th gyaru?

117
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Please forgive me

118
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
This is hard

119
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Go to the side

120
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I'm going to take a bath

121
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I'll just die

122
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I'll take off my glasses

123
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
It's over

124
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Really?

125
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
This is a game

126
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I'm sorry

127
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
2

128
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
3

129
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
It's over

130
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
It's over

131
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Go to the side

132
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
He dances really well

133
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
He dances really well

134
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
He dances really well

135
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I think so

136
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
There are many other gyaru

137
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
He dances really well

138
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I think so

139
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I think so

140
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I think so

141
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I can't believe I was born

142
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
There are many other gyaru like that

143
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Okay

144
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Music, start

145
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I'm sorry

146
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Stop the music

147
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
What are you doing?

148
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
You can't do this

149
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
What?

150
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
You can't do this

151
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
What are you doing?

152
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
You can't do this

153
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
What are you doing?

154
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Don't fight

155
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Wait

156
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
You can't do this

157
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Someone is coming

158
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Queen

159
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Queen

160
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
He's laughing

161
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Queen

162
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Queen

163
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I'm an idiot

164
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
What's going on?

165
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Queen

166
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Queen's voice is loud

167
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I'm an insect

168
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Is there anything more high?

169
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Is there anything more high?

170
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
What is it?

171
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
What is it?

172
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
What is this?

173
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Is this a queen's ball?

174
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
What?

175
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
It's higher than a queen.

176
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
It's not a big ball that's slow.

177
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
This is bad!

178
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Hey!

179
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
This is bad!

180
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
This is bad!

181
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Let's go home.

182
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Let's go home!

183
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I said let's go home!

184
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
What is this?

185
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
This is bad!

186
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
This is bad!

187
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I made a lot of similar shows with those two people.

188
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
What should I do?

189
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
My head is in the direction of the gold.

190
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I'm scared of that.

191
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
It's been a long time since you did a talk show.

192
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
It's been a long time.

193
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
If you think about it, it's been three weeks.

194
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Will it be that long?

195
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
It won't be that long.

196
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
It won't be that long.

197
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
It's been two weeks.

198
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
That's right.

199
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
It's been a long time since you did a talk show.

200
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Ah, you did it.

201
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I don't think that's good.

202
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
It's been a long time since you did a talk show.

203
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Why?

204
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
On Sunday, you did a talk show with Gotts for two hours.

205
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
And then you did a talk show with Gaki for two hours.

206
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
It's been four hours.

207
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
This is really bad.

208
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
It's not like that.

209
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I'm doing it on the side.

210
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
No, it's not like that.

211
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
You don't know the general process.

212
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
For example, you're watching Gotts for two hours, right?

213
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Then you have to put up with it and watch it.

214
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
It's over.

215
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
It's over.

216
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Then you go to the bathroom and watch it again.

217
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
What are you doing?

218
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
You keep saying, Dan-dan, Dan-dan.

219
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
You're always saying Dan-dan.

220
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
You keep telling me to show you what my mom does.

221
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I can't help it.

222
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I can't help it.

223
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I don't understand why you keep saying Gotts and Gaki.

224
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
It's the same.

225
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Dan-dan, Dan-dan.

226
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
It's the same all the time.

227
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
That's right.

228
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I think it's the same thing.

229
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I think it's the same thing.

230
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
That's definitely a loss.

231
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
But the numbers are showing.

232
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
You're so mean.

233
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
You're becoming more and more like Suga-chan.

234
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
There's nothing to do with numbers.

235
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
There's nothing to do with numbers.

236
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
There's nothing to do with numbers.

237
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
You've really become a bad guy.

238
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Why?

239
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:26,000
You made a downtown calendar while I didn't know.

240
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
You're going to sell that next time.

241
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I can't help it.

242
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Even if you don't say anything, money will come in.

243
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
You really like money.

244
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Money, money, money, money.

245
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
That's not true.

246
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Dance with money.

247
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:55,000
You're a guy who dances with money.

248
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:01,000
You're always talking about money.

249
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
That's not true.

250
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I don't want to be fooled by you.

251
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
What are you talking about?

252
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
It's really good.

253
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Seriously.

254
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
What are you?

255
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
What are you?

256
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
What are you?

257
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
That's what I'm talking about.

258
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I'm scared.

259
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Don't say that.

260
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
What?

261
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,000
You made a character.

262
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
You made a character.

263
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Go away.

264
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Go away.

265
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Is curry rice cracker selling?

266
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
It's selling.

267
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I'm just kidding.

268
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I'm just kidding.

269
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Oh, really?

270
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
It's only in Kansai area.

271
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I can't give it to you.

272
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I can't give it to you.

273
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
There's a lot of questions.

274
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Who are you?

275
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Who are you?

276
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
You're stupid.

277
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
You're stupid.

278
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:09,000
It's dirty.

279
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I don't want to say it.

280
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I want to ask you something.

281
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
What do you say in English?

282
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I want to ask you something.

283
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
What do you say in English?

284
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Is there an English word for this?

285
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Of course there is.

286
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
There's an English word for everything.

287
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
When you go to New York, for example,

288
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
when you go to America,

289
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
when you want to eat this,

290
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
what should you say?

291
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
That's right.

292
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
What should you say to communicate with foreigners?

293
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
That's right.

294
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
But there's an English word.

295
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
There's nothing to communicate with foreigners.

296
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Is there an English word for this?

297
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,000
There's an English word for this.

298
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Basically.

299
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
You're a sticky Japanese.

300
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Should I say something in reverse?

301
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Basically.

302
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
What did you say?

303
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Basically.

304
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I can communicate with foreigners.

305
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
You're annoying.

306
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I was surprised.

307
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I was surprised.

308
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Can you communicate with foreigners?

309
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Of course I can communicate with them.

310
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
But I can't communicate with foreigners.

311
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
But you can't say you're a foreigner, right?

312
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Of course I can't say that.

313
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I've been in New York for a long time.

314
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Please tell me that.

315
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I'm a Russian.

316
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
What?

317
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I'm a Russian.

318
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Please.

319
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Please?

320
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Please.

321
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Please.

322
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I'm a Russian.

323
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I don't understand the first part.

324
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I don't understand the first part.

325
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I don't understand the first part.

326
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
What did you say?

327
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I'm a Russian.

328
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
You're so stupid.

329
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I'm really sorry.

330
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
You don't understand English at all.

331
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I'm sorry.

332
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
That's why I can communicate with foreigners.

333
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I can communicate with foreigners.

334
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I know that.

335
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I can communicate with foreigners.

336
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I know that.

337
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
But if you dare to say it...

338
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I don't understand.

339
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
It's a small tone.

340
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Why can't you say it in the first tone?

341
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
You said it.

342
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Yes.

343
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
In that tone.

344
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
In that tone.

345
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Don't say it.

346
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I'm sorry.

347
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
In that tone.

348
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I can communicate with foreigners.

349
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
But if you dare to say it...

350
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I don't understand.

351
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Thank you very much.

352
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
That was a commercial.

353
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I was explaining why I said it in a small tone.

354
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I'm sorry.

355
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,000
If you don't say it in a small tone, it won't work.

356
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
If you say it in a loud tone...

357
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
You're really...

358
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Let me do it, you bastard!

359
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
You're really...

360
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Let me do it, you bastard!

361
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
The meaning changes completely.

362
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
In a small tone.

363
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
In a small tone.

364
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Say it in a loud tone.

365
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
If you say it in a loud tone, the foreigners will misunderstand.

366
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
What are you talking about?

367
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
What are you talking about?

368
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I was really scared.

369
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I was scared.

370
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I was scared.

371
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:44,000
If you work hard, you'll be able to fit into an empty bottle like Matsumoto-san.

372
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
You'll be able to fit into an empty bottle.

373
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Yes.

374
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Umm...

375
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I said yes.

376
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Where did you fit in?

377
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
There are many kinds of bottles.

378
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
It's really hard.

379
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
What do you mean it's hard?

380
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
What do you mean it's hard?

381
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Are there bottles that are easy to fit in or ones that are hard to fit in?

382
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
There are.

383
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
What kind of bottles are easy to fit in?

384
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Umm...

385
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Bickle is the hardest to fit in right now.

386
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
You have a big mouth.

387
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
It's better to have a big mouth.

388
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
On days off, Bickle is the hardest to fit in.

389
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
On days when there's nothing in the morning.

390
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Why?

391
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:37,000
On the next day, when you're at work, Bickle is the hardest to fit in.

392
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
That's true.

393
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
It's really small.

394
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
It's really small.

395
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I think this kind of thing...

396
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
You think about it from a negative perspective, right?

397
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I think it's okay to fit in.

398
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
It's okay to fit in.

399
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:00,000
It's okay to fit in.

400
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Can I ask you something?

401
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Yes, yes.

402
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
How do you fit in?

403
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
How do I fit in?

404
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,000
If you fit in your mouth, your Bickle will be full.

405
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
As long as it's normal.

406
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
As long as it's normal.

407
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,000
What kind of state are you in when you're in Bickle?

408
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I usually break my legs.

409
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Like this?

410
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
It's not that bad.

411
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,000
At first, it was always like this.

412
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Yes.

413
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
It was like that.

414
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Yes.

415
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I broke my legs.

416
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Who told you that?

417
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Who told you that?

418
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Please explain.

419
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,000
At first, it was the person who was wearing the sandals.

420
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Hey, bring me the Bickle!

421
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Bring it here!

422
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
What are you talking about?

423
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
What are you talking about?

424
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
It's okay, it's okay.

425
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
I'll explain it to you.

426
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I won't do anything.

427
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
It's okay.

428
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
What?

429
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
At first, it was like that.

430
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I broke my legs.

431
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
If I do it like this.

432
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,000
At first, there was a person who was wearing the sandals.

433
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Yes.

434
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
The person who was wearing the sandals was looking at you.

435
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Yes, and I...

436
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
And I told him not to look at me forever.

437
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Yes, yes, yes.

438
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Hey, please give me the Bickle.

439
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I don't know that person.

440
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I don't know that person.

441
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I can't go in with you, can I?

442
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Well...

443
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
You can't bring me to that old man, can you?

444
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I think I can.

445
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I think I can, but if it's that person, who is it?

446
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,000
It's okay if you explain it to me.

447
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I don't know if you think it's a good thing.

448
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
What?

449
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I don't know if that old man is you.

450
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
No, that's why you should explain it to me.

451
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I don't know if you think you're a celebrity.

452
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I don't watch TV.

453
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
When do I go in?

454
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I thought it would be okay to wear the Bickle for a while.

455
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I'm going to try the Ramune.

456
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Are you going to the bottom?

457
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I wonder if I did this inside.

458
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
That's the bottle you just happened to get in.

459
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
No one has ever tried to drink it.

460
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
That's okay.

461
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
This is just the right place.

462
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
The Ramune.

463
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I'm going to hold the Bickle like this.

464
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Master Matsumoto.

465
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Why do people laugh when they're tickled?

466
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Well...

467
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Don't laugh!

468
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Listen.

469
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
I'll tell you this.

470
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I don't laugh when I'm tickled.

471
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
You didn't laugh earlier.

472
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Everyone has a mission when they're born.

473
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
It's a difficult story.

474
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,000
I have a mission to entertain people.

475
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
That's why I don't laugh.

476
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
No way.

477
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
I'm the one who makes people laugh.

478
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
While you were talking earlier, you were laughing like this.

479
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
I've seen it many times.

480
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
What?

481
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
It's just my imagination.

482
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
That's why...

483
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I'm the one who...

484
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Huh?

485
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
What?

486
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,000
I'm the one who makes people laugh.

487
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Huh?

488
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
What?

489
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
You were angry earlier.

490
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Shut up.

491
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
I'm the one who makes people laugh.

492
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
You can't stop laughing.

493
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,000
It's impossible for me to laugh.

494
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Really?

495
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Yes.

496
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Shut up!

497
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Seriously.

498
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
This is the most embarrassing thing I've seen today.

499
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
What?

500
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Huh?

501
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
No!

502
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Listen.

503
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I'm the one who makes people laugh.

504
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Oh my god!

505
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I'm the one who provides.

506
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Huh?

507
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
I'm the one who provides.

508
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
I'm the one who...

509
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
I'm the one who makes people laugh.

510
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:38,000
It's just like that.

511
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
I didn't do anything wrong.

512
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I'm the one who makes people laugh.

513
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Why are you making such a scary face?

514
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
It has a different meaning.

515
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:04,000
I'm the one who makes people laugh.

516
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:18,000
It can't be helped. It's your mission.

517
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Why are you doing this?

518
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
It's already 4 o'clock.

519
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Huh?

520
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Why are you laughing?

521
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Why are you laughing?

522
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,000
You're making me cry.

523
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Stop laughing.

524
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:16,000
This program is brought to you by these sponsors.
