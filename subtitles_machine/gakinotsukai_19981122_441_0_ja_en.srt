1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The first episode of the Gaki no Tsukai Arai-hen,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Tsukitsuki Demai o Warakase,

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Gainin-Orai Bakushou Hengei Daisakusei!

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Mr. Matsumoto, how was it today?

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
This is exactly like the title of the previous episode.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
You know, we often ask for delivery food, right?

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
At that time, we don't know if it's a delivery man, an old man, or an old woman.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I'll bring it, but they don't laugh much.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
That's right.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Well, it was funny, wasn't it?

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I really hated that.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
After all, I'm a comedian.

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I want you to laugh at times like that.

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
That's right.

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
That's why I'm going to do some action today.

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm going to make a delivery man laugh.

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Let's do it.

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
If you do it once, it's 500,000 yen.

19
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
500,000 yen?

20
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I'll give it to you.

21
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
What?

22
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
That's cool.

23
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
If you do it once, it's 300,000 yen.

24
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
This program is provided by the sponsor you are watching.

25
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Even if it's downtown, I'm thinking of doing it.

26
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Well, we're still going to be there.

27
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
It's still you guys.

28
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I can't get downtown out.

29
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
If we do it and make us laugh,

30
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'll give you 500,000 yen.

31
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
It's hard.

32
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
500,000 yen?

33
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
You three, collect the money.

34
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
It's almost time.

35
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Can you laugh at times like that?

36
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Excuse me.

37
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Yes.

38
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I'm Kanda.

39
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
What about you?

40
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I'm a comedian.

41
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Do you have a size M?

42
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Do you have a size M?

43
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
But this is slippery.

44
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
It's 1,100 yen.

45
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:26,000
This is...

46
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
It was very sticky.

47
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I don't have a bad hand.

48
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
It's a little bad.

49
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
This is...

50
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I can't say I got it.

51
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
It's 8,000 yen.

52
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Please take it.

53
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Thank you very much.

54
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
It's a business payment.

55
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:57,000
This is not a normal 100 yen.

56
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Do you want me to call you?

57
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Let's all get together.

58
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Let's all get together.

59
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I was smiling.

60
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
But that's...

61
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
It's a business payment.

62
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
That's right.

63
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
If you get it, you'll smile.

64
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
That's right.

65
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
If you get it, you'll smile.

66
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
There's nothing wrong with this.

67
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Do you know the story of the three of us?

68
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
The story of the three of us?

69
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
One will break right away.

70
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Three won't break.

71
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Let's talk about it.

72
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Let's talk about it.

73
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
The three of us are together.

74
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Let's do it one more time.

75
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Let's do it one more time.

76
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
May I?

77
00:03:50,000 --> 00:04:10,000
It's a completely different pattern.

78
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:22,000
76 times.

79
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I'm laughing a little.

80
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I'm laughing a little.

81
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I'm laughing a little.

82
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I'm laughing a little.

83
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I'm laughing a little.

84
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
It's funny.

85
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I'm watching the video.

86
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I don't know.

87
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Wait a minute.

88
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I'm laughing a little.

89
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I'm laughing a little.

90
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I'm watching the video.

91
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I don't know.

92
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Let's all gather.

93
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I'm laughing a little.

94
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I'm laughing a little.

95
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I'm laughing a little.

96
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Did you laugh?

97
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I laughed a little.

98
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Did you laugh?

99
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
No, I didn't laugh.

100
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
My face is dead.

101
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I'm laughing a little.

102
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I ate it.

103
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
You ate it.

104
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
You ate it?

105
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Your face was more proud than the pizza guy.

106
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
It was fun.

107
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
It was fun.

108
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
But you should praise the delivery guy.

109
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
What?

110
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
You don't understand.

111
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I don't understand at all.

112
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
You should praise him.

113
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
There's a way to say that.

114
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Let's go.

115
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I have an idea.

116
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
What?

117
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
There's a way to say that.

118
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Let's do it.

119
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
You're late.

120
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
You're late.

121
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Did I do it on time?

122
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
No.

123
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
How many times did you do it?

124
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I did it twice.

125
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
You did it three times.

126
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
You did it three times.

127
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
You did it naturally.

128
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I did it three times.

129
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Sorry.

130
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
You should have done it naturally.

131
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
You should have done it naturally.

132
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I'm sorry.

133
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Sorry.

134
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I don't understand.

135
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Wait.

136
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
He's showing a joke.

137
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I'm scared.

138
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I don't want to pull it.

139
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
It's 4,095 yen today.

140
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I want to eat a little.

141
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I don't want to pull it.

142
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I want to eat a little.

143
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I pulled it.

144
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I pulled it.

145
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
What is this?

146
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
A comedian?

147
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Did you get a voice?

148
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I don't think I'll get a voice.

149
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
No matter how funny it is.

150
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I was able to put up with it.

151
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
But to be honest, I can't do it.

152
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:03,000
It's the worst place for a Kansai comedian.

153
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
And there's a dead man.

154
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
It's the worst place in Yoshimoto.

155
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Hey, go down.

156
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Please go down.

157
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
You two.

158
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
You two go down.

159
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Please go down.

160
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,000
You can't show us the difference in strength.

161
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
It's okay.

162
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
It's very difficult.

163
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
It's a dead man.

164
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
It's a dead man.

165
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Don't say that.

166
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
It's a dead man.

167
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Yes.

168
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Yes.

169
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Let's go home.

170
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I'm sorry.

171
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Let's go home.

172
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
What?

173
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Let's go home.

174
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Are you okay?

175
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Good morning.

176
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Good morning.

177
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I'm sorry.

178
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
That's right.

179
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
What are you doing?

180
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I'm scared.

181
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
What are you doing?

182
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
That's not good.

183
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
What are you doing?

184
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Don't cry.

185
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I'm not crying at all.

186
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Don't cry.

187
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I'm not crying at all.

188
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Don't worry.

189
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I'm not worried.

190
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Are you okay?

191
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Are you okay?

192
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
It's 1,800 yen.

193
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
What?

194
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
It's 1,800 yen.

195
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Damn it.

196
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
What's wrong?

197
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I can't stop crying.

198
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Bring it over here.

199
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Bring it over here.

200
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
It's okay.

201
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
It's okay.

202
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
It's okay.

203
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
It's okay.

204
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I'm scared.

205
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I'm scared.

206
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I'm scared.

207
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I'm sorry.

208
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
It's okay.

209
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
It's okay.

210
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Come on.

211
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
What's wrong?

212
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I should have been a calendar.

213
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I'm sorry.

214
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I'm sorry.

215
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I'm sorry.

216
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I'm sorry.

217
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I'm sorry.

218
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
It's the opposite.

219
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
He's making me laugh.

220
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I'm sorry.

221
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I'm sorry.

222
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I'm sorry.

223
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
It's okay.

224
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Shall we go home?

225
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Can I eat it?

226
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Thank you very much.

227
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Let's go home.

228
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
It's okay.

229
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I'm sorry.

230
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I'm sorry.

231
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Hey.

232
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Wait a minute.

233
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
It's the opposite.

234
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
It's the opposite.

235
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
It's the opposite.

236
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
He's making me laugh.

237
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
He's making me laugh.

238
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
He's making me laugh.

239
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I should have been a calendar.

240
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
What the hell are you talking about?
