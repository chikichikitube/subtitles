1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Good evening, everyone.

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Today, I have something to tell you.

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:33,000
As a regular of this program, Mr. Hosei Yamasaki, who has been working hard with us since the second time, will graduate from the program.

4
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Well, in the past, I was doing something like saying goodbye to Mr. Yamasaki like this.

5
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:50,000
At that time, I felt like I was having fun with a prank.

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Let's hear the truth from Mr. Hosei Yamasaki.

7
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Well, it's a sudden story, so the staff here are surprised.

8
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Well, let's start with Mr. Yamasaki's mouth.

9
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Well, this is the last time, but I don't want to have such a dark atmosphere.

10
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
So what kind of life story is it?

11
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I'm 36 years old and I'm an old man.

12
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I bought a house and I have two children.

13
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I feel like it's a big step.

14
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Yes, yes, yes, I understand that.

15
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I don't see much confidence.

16
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
My wife's name is Aya.

17
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I know.

18
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Well, as for me, it seems that the gala is going up a lot.

19
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Yes, yes, yes.

20
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:33,000
So, when I look at the budget of the children, it seems that it is becoming very cramped.

21
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:44,000
This is also a real problem that it is very difficult to say.

22
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Do you mean that there are places that you can't pay off?

23
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Well, it's not that I can't pay it off, but it's very cramped.

24
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
It's cramped?

25
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Yes.

26
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
It's cramped.

27
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Also, Hamada-san, after all, he only plays the endo.

28
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Isn't that a little too much to think about?

29
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I read the endo in the dressing room and talked about it secretly.

30
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I thought I would be called next time, but there was no drop at all.

31
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I also talked to my wife about it, but she said that the relationship between people is getting worse.

32
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:43,000
How much did the people who are watching TV understand what Yama-chan said now?

33
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
That's right.

34
00:03:44,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Actually, I think there is something more in the back that we can't measure.

35
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Well then, let's take a look at the famous scenes of Yama-chan that he chose in order to look back on Yagashi-kun's memories.

36
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Yamazaki Hosei, 36 years old.

37
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:48,000
He participated in the program from the second time he started as a child. He has been active for 15 years and has created many famous scenes.

38
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
He will graduate from the program with today's broadcast.

39
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:01,000
So I look back on the great miracles he left behind.

40
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:07,000
5th place Yoshimoto Combi vs. Synchro

41
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Yamazaki-kun, who has been saying that he is also a field in the water since Kanete.

42
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:19,000
He should have participated in the combination, but for some reason he teamed up with the director of Komurasaki without a partner.

43
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Yamazaki Hosei and Komurasaki Kozo

44
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Komu, thank you.

45
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Komu's smile is dirty.

46
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Komu's smile is dirty.

47
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Komu, thank you.

48
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,000
What?

49
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,000
What is this?

50
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,000
4th place High Tension Famous Scenes

51
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Please take a look at the acting of Yamazaki-kun, who was always full of life.

52
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I made a mistake.

53
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I made a mistake.

54
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I made a mistake.

55
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
If I make a mistake, I can't do everything.

56
00:06:47,000 --> 00:07:12,000
If I make a mistake, I can't do everything.

57
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:18,000
5th place Yamazaki Kozo

58
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Yamazaki Kozo

59
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Yamazaki Kozo

60
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Yamazaki Kozo

61
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Yamazaki Kozo

62
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Yamazaki Kozo

63
00:07:53,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Yamazaki Kozo

64
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,000
3rd place Goodbye Yamazaki Hosei

65
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Yamazaki-kun loves to tease people.

66
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:19,000
You've been telling me that you're going to graduate from this program at the same time as me for the past 3 years, and you've been lying to me.

67
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:28,000
But this time, it's really goodbye.

68
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Yamazaki Kozo

69
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Yamazaki Kozo

70
00:08:48,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Yamazaki Kozo

71
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Yamazaki Kozo

72
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,000
2nd place A moving wedding

73
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Yamazaki-kun, who was our idol, finally got married.

74
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:39,000
And we all saw that moving wedding ceremony.

75
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Yamazaki Kozo

76
00:09:50,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Yamazaki Kozo

77
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Yamazaki Kozo

78
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,000
1st place Will the god of laughter come down to Yamazaki?

79
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
The god of laughter doesn't come down at all.

80
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:46,000
You've tried a lot of things to make the god of laughter come down, haven't you?

81
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
It's delicious.

82
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
It's funny.

83
00:10:52,000 --> 00:11:03,000
There's a button connected here, and there's a firework coming out.

84
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
It's amazing that the god of laughter came down for the first time.

85
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Yamazaki Kozo

86
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Yamazaki Kozo

87
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Yamazaki Kozo

88
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Yamazaki Kozo

89
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Yamazaki Kozo

90
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Yamazaki Kozo

91
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Yamazaki Kozo

92
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Yamazaki Kozo

93
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Yamazaki Kozo

94
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Yamazaki Kozo

95
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Yamazaki Kozo

96
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Yamazaki Kozo

97
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Yamazaki Kozo

98
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Yamazaki Kozo

99
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Yamazaki Kozo

100
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Yamazaki Kozo

101
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Yamazaki Kozo

102
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:14,000
How was it, Ayano?

103
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I thought there were a lot of VTRs.

104
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
It's time to say goodbye.

105
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Please say goodbye to the producer.

106
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Thank you for your hard work, Yama-chan.

107
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I was told that it was hard to be a gyaru.

108
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Actually, I was thinking of uploading it again in April.

109
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I'm really shocked and disappointed.

110
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,000
But regardless of the gyaru, I came to Japan TV this time.

111
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Anyway, I was told to throw away everything I didn't need in Kojima.

112
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I never thought I'd throw Yamazaki away in Kojima.

113
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
That's also an order from the company.

114
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Thank you very much for your hard work.

115
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Let's talk to each other one by one.

116
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Thank you for your hard work.

117
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Yamazaki-san will be removed, but what he did as a kid will remain in everyone's hearts.

118
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Thank you for your hard work.

119
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Thank you for your hard work.

120
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:38,000
At first, I saw Ko-san on TV.

121
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I wanted to be an artist with a flower like Ko-san as soon as possible.

122
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I really don't have a flower.

123
00:15:52,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Thank you for your hard work.

124
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I've only met Yama-chan on the spot.

125
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:18,000
It was about three hours long.

126
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I don't have any regrets about this.

127
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Even if you graduate, please be healthy.

128
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Thank you for your hard work.

129
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:40,000
There was a talent maker in the dressing room.

130
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:50,000
There were so many people that I thought there would be so many changes.

131
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:57,000
If we were a family...

132
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I would hate a real family.

133
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Thank you for your hard work.

134
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Finally, let's say goodbye to everyone in front of the TV.

135
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Who do you think will be surrounded by such a large bouquet of flowers?

136
00:17:52,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I've been out since the second time I was a kid.

137
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:31,000
It's been 15 years since I've been out.

138
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I'm sorry.

139
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I'm sorry.

140
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I said I didn't cry.

141
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Goodbye, Yama-chan.

142
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Thank you for your hard work.

143
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:21,000
It's not like he's going to quit.

144
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:32,000
If you search for Yamanaki on DVD recorders, they'll record it for you.

145
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:37,000
I'm sure the recorders will be in trouble if you put it in.

146
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Who?

147
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Let's do it again next week.

148
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Let's go home.

149
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Yama-chan is a kid's worker.

150
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I can't do it.

151
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Viewers, are you surprised?

152
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I'm going to ask Kogoriko to do it again.

153
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
It's the first time I've seen it.

154
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Yama-chan is a kid's worker.

155
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:30,000
I can't do it.

156
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:44,000
We'll be waiting for the day we can see you again.

157
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I'll wave my hand and shout on the road of cherry blossoms.

158
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I can't stop crying.

159
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:09,000
It's my fate to go down a sad road.

160
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:17,000
I can't stop crying.

161
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:25,000
I can't stop crying.

162
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:32,000
I can't stop crying.

163
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:39,000
I can't stop crying.

164
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I can't stop crying.

165
00:21:47,000 --> 00:22:02,000
I'll wave my hand and shout on the road of cherry blossoms.

166
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
We're going to change our costumes again.

167
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:11,000
I hope it's the last one this year.

168
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:18,000
We're going to change our costumes again.

169
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:23,000
This is from Yamazaki-san.

170
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,000
It's a little low.

171
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
I only know for an hour.

172
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
It's terrible, isn't it?

173
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Let's go!

174
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:09,000
I can't stop crying.

175
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:21,000
I can't stop crying.

176
