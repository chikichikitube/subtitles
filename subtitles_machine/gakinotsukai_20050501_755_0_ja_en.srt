00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,000
The greatest fortune teller of this century, who was recently reported from Canada, Mr. Hikateri Umeda, has come to visit us tonight.

2
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I hope to witness a miraculous experience with you all.

3
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
And this time, we have gathered all of you here as witnesses of that miracle.

4
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Welcome. Thank you.

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Good evening.

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Do you know the person named Umeda Piccadilly?

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
No, I have no idea.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Really?

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Yes. I have no idea what is going to happen.

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Matsumoto-san told you?

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I've never been a fortune teller in a show like this.

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
To be honest, I'm half-hearted.

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I'm not sure how far I've gone.

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,000
In Canada, the average ratings are 27%.

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
And the average ratings are 35% in the 8 o'clock period.

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
It's a very famous fortune teller.

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I see.

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I don't think it's that important to me.

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I think you can understand this.

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,000
He is the person who guessed that Mr.Kazuko Hosoki would win.

21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I think you can guess that he is a tough guy.

22
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm looking forward to it.

23
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
We will now have each of you to tell us your story.

24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I would like to remind you that this is about Canada.

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:55,000
There was a TV show that you were in, and one of the guests was in a bad mood.

26
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
He was attacked by the show, so he left the studio and went to the airport.

27
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
He was then reported to the police.

28
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I'm sorry, but please don't be rude.

29
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
It's okay.

30
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
The next 4 games are 100% hit rate.

31
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
All the 3 games are the best.

32
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
The world's best 11 fortune tellers.

33
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Picaneri, Umeda, and Kamitsuki.

34
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Tonight, you are a witness of a miracle

35
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I will bite you more and more

36
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:45,080
Mr. Piccadilly, the members who will be

37
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,080
interviewed today are these people. What did you feel intuitively?

38
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:43,080
You and you and you too, you are no good too

39
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:48,080
I don't think I can do anything else but that.

40
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,080
I didn't get any work done.

41
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,080
I wonder what happened.

42
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:58,080
If 5 people and 14 people are not good enough, I thought I could just hire a good guy.

43
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:04,080
The first time they met was in the 14th year of the combination.

44
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,080
They were both in the same room.

45
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,080
What the...

46
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:15,080
How do you feel about the recent atmosphere between the two of them?

47
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:19,080
They are married and have children.

48
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:25,080
In that sense, I think they are calm.

49
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:36,080
It seems that Piccadilly wants to make a serious prediction about their relationship.

50
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,080
Yes, yes.

51
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:42,080
I wonder if it's okay to go to the wall?

52
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:55,080
At this rate...

53
00:04:55,080 --> 00:05:04,080
The combination is disbanded.

54
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,080
Why is that?

55
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,080
Do you want to know?

56
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,080
Yes.

57
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,080
I want to know.

58
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,080
Do you really want to hear it?

59
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,080
Yes, yes, I want to hear it.

60
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:40,080
You guys are having a big party this winter.

61
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:43,080
Both of you?

62
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:46,080
Both of us, and a big party?

63
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,480
Vertically, Okiss�hhh

64
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:52,900
Is it okasss hits absolutely the altro?

65
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:07,040
The suspicion for the introduction

66
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,600
If you have firmly for the introdugsion

67
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,600
向こう監督の全身塗るバットを取り出す

68
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,600
It's the same as before

69
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,600
Mountains get back to their places

70
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,600
The Merit will succeed

71
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,600
Yes.

72
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,600
Jet!

73
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,600
Ah!

74
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:42,600
I think you forgot the first line.

75
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:46,600
You didn't do the greeting.

76
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,600
To be honest, I didn't do it.

77
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,600
I thought, is that so?

78
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,600
Yes.

79
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:59,600
The next interviewee is Hosei Yamasaki.

80
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:04,600
He is a serious entertainer who is in trouble.

81
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:08,600
I'm doing a prank called, I won't quit.

82
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:12,600
I'm doing a show called, I won't quit.

83
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:21,600
When I was doing that, I heard that there were a lot of letters saying that I should quit.

84
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:27,600
I was thinking about what I should do to become the person that is needed more.

85
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:31,600
Is that true about the two of you?

86
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:35,600
Well, I heard about it.

87
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,600
Yes, I heard about it.

88
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:43,600
I don't have any complaints about it.

89
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:48,600
Then, please perform the miracle of the Ileva fortune teller, Hikariri-san.

90
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,600
You...

91
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:09,100
I've told you before, right?

92
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:13,100
I'm going to change my name.

93
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,100
Change your name?

94
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:18,100
You mean change your name?

95
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,100
Change your name?

96
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:21,100
I changed my name.

97
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:25,100
But I've never met you before.

98
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:32,100
You didn't change your name.

99
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:34,200
Dead箱?

100
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:40,360
Just go to hell!

101
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:51,120
Going...

102
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,120
I wonder if it's a good idea.

103
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:08,120
If you don't want to change it, today is over.

104
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,120
What should I change it to?

105
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:21,120
Please make it clear whether you can change it or not.

106
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,120
He's angry.

107
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,120
Yes, he's a bit nervous.

108
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:37,120
Yamazaki-san, I think it would be difficult for Piccadilly-san to answer if you don't make the explanation a premise.

109
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,120
Yes.

110
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:41,120
Is it okay to explain?

111
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:45,120
I'll change it.

112
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,120
Congratulations.

113
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,120
The next is...

114
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,120
Zyakiki!

115
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,120
Congratulations!

116
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,120
Zyakiki...

117
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,120
Monkiki...

118
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,120
I'm sorry.

119
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,120
I think that guy is...

120
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,120
Ahhhhhhhhhh!

121
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,120
I'm done.

122
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,120
Yamada-san, no, Zakkiki-san, please come over here.

123
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:43,120
Well, it's really complicated.

124
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,120
How about you, Tanaka-san?

125
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:53,120
Of course, I want to be called Mr. Zakkiki.

126
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,120
Then, could you call me Mr. Endo?

127
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,120
Ah, then, please.

128
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,120
Mr. Zakkiki.

129
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,120
I'm saying it properly.

130
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,120
Finally, Hamadan Masatoshi.

131
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:13,120
Piccadilly is in a private room.

132
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:17,120
Hamada-san seems a little uneasy.

133
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:24,120
Then, the fortune teller of the century, Piccadilly Umeda-san, please.

134
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,120
Hamada.

135
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,120
Yes.

136
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,120
Yes.

137
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,120
I think it's about time I bite into you.

138
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,120
What?

139
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:55,120
I'm going to divorce you this year.

140
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,120
What?

141
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:08,820
You...

142
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,520
You like collecting videos, right?

143
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:14,820
Wow.

144
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:16,820
Hey, I just heard Matsumoto-san saying,

145
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:17,820
that he's amazing.

146
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:18,820
What's the truth?

147
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:19,820
Well, it's just that...

148
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:21,820
I'm not really a collector.

149
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,820
Well, well...

150
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:25,820
I think so.

151
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:29,820
But the fact that she knows about it...

152
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:36,820
She doesn't think it well.

153
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:39,820
I see.

154
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:45,820
What should we do?

155
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:49,820
If we stop it, it's a different reason.

156
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:50,820
Gabbling.

157
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,820
I'm telling you.

158
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:55,820
There's no other reason.

159
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:57,820
I wonder if it's okay to follow the rules.

160
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:59,820
Oh, it's strange.

161
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:20,880
In ¿ mucha Sis première!

162
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,240
Who are you doing?

163
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,380
I'm coming.

164
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:51,900
You wrote your love driveway number go do psychologist

165
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:53,900
I see.

166
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:59,900
So, you're saying that it's okay?

167
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:04,900
You don't have to delete the video.

168
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:06,900
Just once a day...

169
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,900
Tell her that I love her.

170
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:11,900
I told her.

171
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:15,900
Hamahama-san, it's important.

172
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:17,900
You should tell her, right?

173
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,900
From the camera's point of view.

174
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:22,900
I'll tell you when I get home.

175
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:24,900
You go!

176
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:31,900
I'll tell you when I get home.

177
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:34,900
I'm not going to tell you here.

178
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,900
You go!

179
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:40,900
If you make him angry, he'll get angry.

180
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:44,900
He'll get angry and he'll be in trouble.

181
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:47,900
Does that mean there's no divorce?

182
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:51,900
Say that you love her.

183
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:54,900
Oh, he's saying it in a kind way.

184
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:59,900
Hamada-san, I'm sorry but you should say it.

185
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,900
You should say it.

186
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:05,900
I'll say it as I love her.

187
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,900
I love her.

188
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:11,900
Say it again.

189
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:14,900
He didn't like it.

190
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:16,900
I was found out.

191
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,900
I love you.

192
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:21,900
Is that okay?

193
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:35,900
I don't know why Masato-san is so serious about saying that he loves her.

194
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:48,900
I guess it's normal to be embarrassed, but I think it's a good thing that we overcame it and became Pika Deli.

195
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:53,900
I think everyone will be convinced by what I said.

196
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:58,900
I think it's better to tell the people who are in the line from Mr. Zakkiki.

197
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:02,900
I think it's better for us to tell Pika Deli.

198
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:04,900
You should say that.

199
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:07,900
What is it?

200
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:08,900
I love you.

201
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:09,900
Jacky.

202
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:12,900
I love you.

203
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:19,900
I love you.

204
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,900
What is it?

205
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:24,900
What is it?

206
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:25,900
You should say your name.

207
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,900
I don't have to say my name.

208
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:32,900
No, no, let's not talk about names.

209
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:35,900
No, no, let's not talk about names.

210
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:37,900
Kaneri-san, are you serious?

211
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:39,900
I'm serious.

212
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,900
It's not the same.

213
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,900
It's a fortune-telling.

214
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:51,900
You're asking if we want to break up.

215
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:55,900
Well, then...

216
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:59,900
I love you, Chiaki.

217
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:02,900
I love you!

218
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:04,900
It's a battle!

219
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,900
That was good.

220
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:10,900
The last one tonight is Hitoshi Matsumoto.

221
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:16,900
The prophecy that will affect his life will fly out of Piccadilly.

222
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:20,900
The last person to take the seat is Mr. Hitoshi Matsumoto.

223
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:26,900
Mr. Matsumoto, have you ever thought of what you would be called?

224
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:31,900
Well, what would it be? If I had to say there are many, there are many. If I had to say there aren't many, there aren't many.

225
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,900
I don't know.

226
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:38,900
Well then, Mr. Yumezawa Piccadilly, please.

227
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,900
I'll kill you.

228
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,900
I'll bite you.

229
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,900
I'll bite you.

230
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:03,900
You...

231
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:07,900
If you don't marry, you'll die.

232
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,900
I'll die?

233
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:13,900
No, no, this is...

234
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,900
And you'll be in the year-end.

235
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:19,900
Year-end?

236
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,900
Year-end?

237
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:25,900
Really?

238
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,900
Who are you talking about?

239
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:32,900
I am...

240
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,900
Piccadilly Umeda

241
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,900
Are you drunk?

242
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:49,900
No, I'm not

243
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:51,900
I am...

244
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,900
Piccadilly Umeda

245
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,900
I don't know.

246
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:05,900
I wonder what kind of person he likes.

247
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,900
Then, it's about time...

248
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,900
...to remove the lever.

249
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:13,900
No.

250
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:15,900
This is the first time.

251
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:16,900
This is the first time.

252
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:19,900
The first time I heard the word, I took it off.

253
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:26,900
Oh?

254
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:38,900
What should I do now?

255
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:43,900
What should I do now?

256
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:45,900
Are you reading the fortune now?

257
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,900
It's probably the one behind us.

258
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:48,900
That's right.

259
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:50,900
It's probably the one behind us.

260
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,900
It's completely out.

261
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:17,900
This is a bit...

262
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:21,900
We don't know what it is.

263
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:23,900
It's down.

264
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:27,900
It's really down.

265
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,900
It's over.

266
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:39,900
It's over.

267
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:44,900
Now, Piccadilly is coming back!

268
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:47,900
Piccadilly, thank you for the countless miracles!

269
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:49,900
Thank you very much!

270
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:52,900
This is a really amazing way to go back.

271
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:56,900
So tonight, we have an emergency special program.

272
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:59,900
Piccadilly Umeda's 100% accuracy rate,

273
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:04,900
the miracle of the best 11th-level fortune-telling in the century,

274
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:07,900
we have seen it. How was it?

275
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:12,900
The next person to be bitten is you in front of the TV!

276
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:17,900
Shut! On!

277
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:24,900
Ladies and gentlemen...

278
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:28,900
Good evening!

279
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:31,900
Good evening.

280
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:35,900
There are a lot of juniors here, right?

281
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:37,900
Yes, he is.

282
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:41,900
He is in Ooyama, right?

283
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:42,900
Yes, in Ooyama.

284
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:43,900
In Yoshimoto Shinji Station.

285
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:44,900
Yes, yes.

286
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:45,900
In Fukuyama.

287
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:46,900
Yes, yes.

288
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,900
He is a fool.

289
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:51,900
He is so little.

290
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:54,900
He is so little.

291
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:58,900
The child above is 2 years old, and the child below is still a baby.

292
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,900
He is so cute.

293
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:04,900
He is addicted to playing with a swing.

294
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:06,900
He said, I'm not going to the swing.

295
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:08,900
He said, Ma-kun, Ma-kun, are you going to the swing?

296
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:12,900
When I went, the girl was doing it first.

297
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:15,900
She was waiting for 2-3 minutes.

298
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:17,900
I couldn't stand it anymore.

299
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:19,900
Hey, I'm going to do it!

300
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:22,900
Actually, I did it the other day.

301
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:28,900
This time, Ma-kun is on the slide.

302
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:31,900
When I went, there were two children first.

303
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:35,900
I said, I have a friend who is like that, so I don't think he should be like that.

304
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:37,900
He said he played with Ma-kun.

305
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:39,900
He was a very good kid.

306
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:40,900
He said, yes.

307
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:42,900
He said, let's play together.

308
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:43,900
He said, let's play together.

309
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,900
It was like a competition.

310
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:51,900
He ran up the stairs and won the first one.

311
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:53,900
The other kids won.

312
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:56,900
I was the first.

313
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:58,900
Ma-kun said, I was the second.

314
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,900
Great.

315
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:02,900
I said, let's do it again!

316
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:07,900
And when I said that again, the 10,000 yen guy came again.

317
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:10,900
When I said, 10,000 yen again, he turned around.

318
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,900
That was too fast!

319
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:25,900
I said, let's do it again!

320
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:29,900
And when I went, he grabbed the pants of the guy who did the 10,000 yen.

321
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:31,900
I'm sorry, I was late for the start.

322
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:34,900
That's the worst!
