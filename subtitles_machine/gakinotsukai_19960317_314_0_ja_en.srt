1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Oh, oh, you can't miss this!

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
The two's free talk is the basis for the downtown kid's use and Arahen.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
The recording is actually close to an hour, so there are a lot of things that could not be broadcasted.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
So tonight, let's release the secret TV talk all at once.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Kid's Use Marugi Preservation Room Unpublished Talk Show

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Now, gotta check this out!

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
This program is brought to you by these sponsors.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
First, from this year's unpublished talk broadcasted on January 7th.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Matsumoto-san, it seems that you gave birth to a boy last month.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
How difficult was it? Please tell us your impressions.

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Hey, hey!

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Well, if you're going to give birth, you have to be a Yagizano kid.

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Was it a boy?

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Yes, it was a boy.

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
It was really difficult to reduce it.

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
How difficult was it? Where did it come from?

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
What?

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Where did it come from?

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Well, from the side of the ***.

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Where is the *** side?

21
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
From the side of this ***.

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Oh, so you had to cut it?

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
What?

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
What do you mean, what?

25
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
There's nothing open.

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
There was nothing open.

27
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
So when I was in high school, I hid it in my pocket.

28
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
You were hiding it in your ***.

29
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I didn't want to be found out.

30
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
You didn't want to be found out.

31
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:50,000
So I hid it in my ***.

32
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
You were a foreigner?

33
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Yes, I was a foreigner.

34
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Your partner.

35
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Yes, my partner.

36
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
What's your name?

37
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
What's your name?

38
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Stranger.

39
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
What are you doing now, stranger?

40
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I'm working.

41
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
What are you doing now?

42
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Well, I'm working at K-ON twice.

43
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,000
What?

44
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
That's the thing.

45
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
That's the thing.

46
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
It's strange.

47
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I can't do this.

48
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Next, the unspoken question of the day of January 21st and the unit of illusions.

49
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Matsumoto-san, please tell us one thing about Matsumoto-san, who played the role of the face of the entertainment world and the 80% of the entertainer couple actually had an affair behind his back.

50
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:55,000
It's a secret information that even Komuro Family's Awada-san doesn't know, but Komuro is going to form an imaginary unit this year.

51
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
It seems that he is one of the members that the whole of Japan is looking forward to. Does Matsumoto-san know about it?

52
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Yes, I know.

53
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I'm wearing it properly.

54
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
What are you wearing?

55
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
It's a cell phone.

56
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
A cell phone?

57
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Do you know about it?

58
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Yes, I know.

59
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
It's a new unit.

60
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Yes.

61
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I'm going to be surprised. I don't know if I can say this.

62
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Really?

63
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Yes.

64
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
How many people are there?

65
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Please don't be surprised.

66
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
It's quite unexpected.

67
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Is that so?

68
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Yes.

69
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:37,000
It's a Chiba Shinichi and a dog.

70
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Komuro-san, what are you going to do?

71
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:52,000
You brought a Chiba Shinichi and a dog. What are you going to do?

72
00:03:52,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I was surprised in a different way.

73
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Are you holding it?

74
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I'm holding it.

75
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Are you holding a dog when you sing a Chiba Shinichi song?

76
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
If you think of it as holding a dog, that's it.

77
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
But it's a unit.

78
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
But you have to do something. You have a role.

79
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I'm not going to avoid it.

80
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Are you going to avoid it?

81
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
No, it's like this.

82
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I'm not avoiding it.

83
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I'm standing up, but my feet are on the ground.

84
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I'm holding it like this.

85
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
If you're going to avoid it, you have to stay like this.

86
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
That's right.

87
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Every time I move, I'm like this.

88
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:53,000
But...

89
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Next, the three unopened talks.

90
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Matsumoto-san is active as a super model who can see the world.

91
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:10,000
He's going to take a break from the program.

92
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I'm going to have this party next month.

93
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Next month?

94
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Yes.

95
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Where did you see it?

96
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
The party.

97
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
What?

98
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I saw the party in me.

99
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
What are you talking about?

100
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I'm going to have a party next month.

101
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Is that so?

102
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I don't know if it's convenient for work.

103
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Do you work as a model?

104
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I do.

105
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
It says super model.

106
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
That's right.

107
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
90% of my income is model.

108
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
That's not true.

109
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
No, no, no.

110
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I've been looking at it.

111
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I've been looking at it.

112
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Where have you been?

113
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I've been looking at it.

114
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I've been looking at it on my nose.

115
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
That's harsh.

116
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I've been looking at it on my nose.

117
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
What kind of clothes do you wear?

118
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I can't tell you that.

119
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
It's hard to do that.

120
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Tell me a little bit.

121
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I'm going to get angry.

122
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I feel sorry for you.

123
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
It's been a long time since I've seen you.

124
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Really?

125
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Yes.

126
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
What do you mean?

127
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
It's hard to do that.

128
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I feel sorry for you.

129
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I'm going to get angry.

130
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
It's hard to do that.

131
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
It's hard to do that.

132
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
It's hard to do that.

133
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
It's hard to do that.

134
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Tell me a little bit.

135
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
What are you going to do?

136
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Do you know what's going to be popular this year?

137
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I don't know.

138
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Even if you're called the leader of the fashion world, you don't know.

139
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I'm sorry. Please tell me.

140
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Do you know what's going to be popular this year?

141
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I don't know at all.

142
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
You don't know that?

143
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Yes.

144
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
It's a popular food every year.

145
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Yes.

146
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
What was popular last year?

147
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I don't know.

148
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I don't know that either.

149
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I don't want to talk about this anymore.

150
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I'm telling you because I don't know.

151
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Last year, white was popular.

152
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
You're saying what?

153
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I don't know.

154
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
You didn't know?

155
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I don't know.

156
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I'm sorry.

157
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:27,000
This year, yellowish green is popular.

158
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Yellowish green.

159
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Yellowish green is popular.

160
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Really?

161
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Yes.

162
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
This time it's a jacket.

163
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I'll wear a jacket.

164
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
A white jacket.

165
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
No, no, no.

166
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
That was last year.

167
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
This year?

168
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
This year.

169
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Ninety-six.

170
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I'll ask you this.

171
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
If yellowish green is popular, is it all yellowish green?

172
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
No, that's not it.

173
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Wait a minute.

174
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
There's yellowish green.

175
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Of course there's yellowish green in it.

176
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I'm sorry.

177
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
First, a white jacket.

178
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
A jacket, right?

179
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
A white jacket.

180
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
And a pair of red pants.

181
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
A white jacket and red pants?

182
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Let's wear red pants.

183
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
You'll wear them, right?

184
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I'll wear them, right?

185
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
You'll wear them, right?

186
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:24,000
And a pair of black gloves.

187
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
And a white hat.

188
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I'll wear them.

189
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
It's all yellowish green.

190
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Well, that's fine.

191
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Will this story spread?

192
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Where did the yellowish green come from?

193
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
And then...

194
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
What's this?

195
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I have a bat.

196
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
It's yellowish green, so it's one point.

197
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I'll catch you.

198
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
And here it is.

199
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:08,000
What happens if a herbivore eats meat?

200
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I don't think about it.

201
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Well, to tell you the truth, they all want to eat meat.

202
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Right?

203
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
They all want to eat meat.

204
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Even rabbits really want to eat meat.

205
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
But they can't eat it.

206
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Why is that?

207
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
They don't have the means to catch prey.

208
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Even if their ears are this long, they won't die.

209
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Even if they come close.

210
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Well, they all want to eat it.

211
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
It doesn't matter.

212
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Well, for example, people who don't smoke.

213
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
If they suddenly start smoking, they'll go like this.

214
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,000
It's the same thing. It's a rejection reaction.

215
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
It's a bit of a PP.

216
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
That won't work.

217
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I've seen it once.

218
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:06,000
A deer eating meat.

219
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
A deer eating meat?

220
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
It's like a deer eating a cow.

221
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Really?

222
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
What happened?

223
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I was surprised.

224
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Who?

225
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I saw it and thought, I did it.

226
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
You did it?

227
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Yes.

228
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
What did you do?

229
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I think I did it.

230
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Why?

231
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I think it was happening.

232
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Happening?

233
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Happening.

234
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Happening? What?

235
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
It was happening.

236
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
What's happening?

237
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
It was happening.

238
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
It was happening, right?

239
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
What's happening?

240
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
It's happening.

241
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
What? Happening?

242
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
It's happening.

243
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
It's not happening.

244
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
What is it?

245
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
What if it didn't die?

246
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
The deer?

247
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,000
The deer was excited when it ate the meat.

248
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
What is it?

249
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:05,000
It's like, is there enough money?

250
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
What is money?

251
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
It's so happy.

252
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
It's so expensive.

253
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
It was opening its mouth.

254
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I was just kidding.

255
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
It was saying, I got the receipt.

256
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
It was opening its mouth.

257
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:31,000
It was saying, I'm going to the basement.

258
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:36,000
It was saying, I'm going to the basement.

259
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Furthermore, this talk.

260
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Can you tell us how to distinguish a woman from a man in one shot?

261
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I've learned a lot of things.

262
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:52,000
And I've finally reached that point.

263
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
You can distinguish a woman from a man in one shot?

264
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Yes.

265
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
It says, in one shot.

266
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Yes, you can distinguish.

267
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Really?

268
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
What would happen in this case?

269
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
What would happen?

270
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Would it be your girlfriend?

271
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Or would it be someone walking on the street?

272
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
This is something you don't see.

273
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
You don't see?

274
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Would you be able to tell that it's her when she walks by?

275
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Would you?

276
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Got it.

277
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Well, first, a woman in one shot.

278
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Doesn't wear a skirt.

279
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Oh, really?

280
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Doesn't wear a skirt.

281
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
It's something you don't like.

282
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
It's defenseless.

283
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
You want to keep it firm.

284
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
That's serious.

285
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Not everyone would say that, but that's how it's usually done.

286
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
First, remember this.

287
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
And then, pants.

288
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Some people like g-pants.

289
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
But even with pants, wearing white pants is absolutely impossible.

290
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I see.

291
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
It's like an old lady's laugh.

292
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Yes, yes.

293
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
And then, I observed various things.

294
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
For example, let's pick up a girl.

295
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
What about this guy? What about today?

296
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
First, pants or pants.

297
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I see.

298
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
All of these things are safe.

299
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Wear a skirt.

300
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
And it's not even a white skirt.

301
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
This is a pretty high percentage.

302
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I see.

303
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
80% is OK.

304
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
At that time, I'll do something a little mean.

305
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I see.

306
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I'll say, show me your bag.

307
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
And then, the girl...

308
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
And then...

309
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
If she sees it, it's bad.

310
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
If she sees it, it's bad.

311
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Is that OK?

312
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
And then, when I said, lend me the toilet.

313
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
She said, OK.

314
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I glanced at her.

315
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I can see almost everything.

316
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
That kind of person wears a mysterious small bag.

317
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
It doesn't matter if it's research.

318
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
It doesn't matter if it's research.

319
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
What's that?

320
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
No, no, no.

321
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I think I'm saying something pretty good.

322
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
It's not a good thing.

323
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
It's like, yes, yes.

324
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Well, I don't know about the small bag.

325
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
For example, today...

326
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,000
So, you're saying that you can see everything at once.

327
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Let's say how much of this is 100% correct.

328
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
This is a scene from my show, NINZA-BURO.

329
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
The person wearing black pants is correct.

330
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
So, for example, today, you're in the audience.

331
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Is that OK?

332
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
When you look around...

333
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Oh, there's a girl.

334
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
She's wearing black pants.

335
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
What a coincidence.

336
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Wait, wait.

337
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Why are you here?

338
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Oh, Otaku, by the way...

339
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Wait, wait.

340
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
You have to say it properly.

341
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Don't be shy.

342
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
If it's true, it's true.

343
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
If it's not, it's not.

344
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
You really have to say it.

345
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
What do you think?

346
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
It's not.

347
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
It's not.

348
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
She's wearing it with her boyfriend today.

349
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
What?

350
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
These are black pants.

351
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
A girl and a boy.

352
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
She doesn't have sex.

353
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
That's the other way around.

354
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
What do you think?

355
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
It's not.

356
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
What's not?

357
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
What do you mean it's not?

358
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I don't know if you know.

359
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I know.

360
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I'm not going to say it's not.

361
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
It came suddenly.

362
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
It's not.

363
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I don't know.

364
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
She's wearing black pants.

365
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:52,000
According to my research, if there are four people, one of them is like that.

366
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
What does that mean?

367
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
If there are four people, one of them is like that.

368
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
That's what the emperor said.

369
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
What did the emperor say?

370
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Because girls usually have sex for a week.

371
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
You're laughing too much.

372
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
They have sex for a week.

373
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,000
If they have sex for a week, that means they have sex for four times a month.

374
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
If you think about it, it's one-fourth of the probability.

375
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,000
If you think about it, if there are four women, there's one.

376
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
That's the calculation.

377
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
So you and you and you and you and you and you and you.

378
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
It's 25% probability.

379
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
That's the calculation.

380
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
And if she's wearing pants, it's 50%.

381
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
That's it.

382
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
And if she's wearing black pants, it's 80%.

383
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
And if she doesn't like the bag, it's 94%.

384
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
It's a mystery.

385
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I understand.

386
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
By the way, there are four or five women around here.

387
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Who's the manager?

388
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:04,000
It doesn't matter if I'm the manager.

389
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
It doesn't matter.

390
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Why doesn't it matter?

391
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
It's like, there's no problem!

392
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
But I understand.

393
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I understand.

394
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
What?

395
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I understand.

396
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
It's because the children are the best.

397
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,000
There are a lot of shows, but they're all useless.

398
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:39,000
But you always put them in the show.

399
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
You should say it on the spot.

400
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Really.

401
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I haven't watched TV recently. What's useless?

402
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
What's useless?

403
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
It's almost useless.

404
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
What's useless?

405
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I don't know what's useless.

406
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
What's useless?

407
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Which is useless?

408
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Which is useless?

409
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:08,000
But recently, I don't think it's decreasing.

410
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I think it's a good tendency.

411
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I see.

412
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
It doesn't matter if a weak person puts it on.

413
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
It's useless!

414
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
It's useless!

415
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:26,000
You've been telling me all the time lately.

416
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,000
You've been telling me all the time lately.

417
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Who's doing that?

418
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
What?

419
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Who's doing that?

420
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Who's doing that?

421
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Who's doing that?

422
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I don't know.

423
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
You don't know?

424
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
You don't know?

425
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I don't know.

426
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
You don't know?

427
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I'm going to say it!

428
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
You aren't telling the truth.

429
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
You aren't telling the truth.

430
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
You aren't telling the truth.

431
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
You didn't say that?

432
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
You're not saying something you didn't mean to.

433
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Say something.

434
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Say sorry to me.

435
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Ouch!

436
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Ouch!

437
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I didn't say that!

438
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
The voice of the government!

439
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,000
What are you doing here, Yo-san?

440
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
What are you doing here, Yo-san?

441
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
What do you mean?

442
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
What are you doing here, Yo-san?

443
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I don't know at all.

444
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
No, no.

445
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
What?

446
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Shall we take a look?

447
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Let's take a look.

448
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,000
What are you doing here, Yo-san?

449
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Please.

450
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Rolling stone.

451
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
What are you doing here, Yo-san?

452
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
What are you doing here, Yo-san?

453
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
An unreleased talk on February 11th.

454
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
What is the Iwafu Telephone Phrase?

455
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:08,000
A man named Masumoto-san, who once passed the Kyoto University, but chose to stay in Yoshimoto.

456
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:14,000
In the case of a college entrance exam, it is often said that a person who failed to pass the exam will receive a cherry blossom.

457
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
But I feel that it is a bit late, and it is a bit blue.

458
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Please think of a complaint that will not make a person who failed to pass the exam blue.

459
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Did you pass the exam at Kyoto University?

460
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
At that time, did you pass the exam with a cherry blossom?

461
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
At my university, I didn't do that.

462
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
You didn't do that?

463
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
I didn't do that.

464
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
It was a little more fashionable.

465
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Oh, really?

466
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Yes.

467
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Both the person who failed and the person who passed the exam did it properly.

468
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
What did you study at that time?

469
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
When I passed the exam...

470
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
When you passed the exam?

471
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Yes.

472
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Kyoto University, right?

473
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Kyoto University.

474
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Kyoto University.

475
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Yes, Kyoto University.

476
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
What did you study?

477
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Well...

478
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Ma-eba-kira.

479
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Kira is good.

480
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Kira is like, oh, I passed the exam.

481
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
What is Ma-eba-kira?

482
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Oh, I see.

483
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Ma-eba-kira is a joke that makes you happy.

484
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Ma-eba-kira.

485
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
I see.

486
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
How did you pass the exam?

487
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Uh...

488
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
I was a little jealous.

489
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Huh?

490
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
You don't really understand that.

491
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
I really don't.

492
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
You really don't understand that.

493
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Ma-eba-kira, I understand what you think.

494
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
But you don't understand that I was jealous.

495
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
You understand, don't you?

496
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
It's not something that makes you happy.

497
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
This is like, oh, oh, oh...

498
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
And then, you're like, shah! shah!

499
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
And then, you're like, bo!

500
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
You don't like it, do you?

501
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
I don't like it.

502
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
You don't like it, do you?

503
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
That's why.

504
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,500
You haven't become that blue yet, have you?

505
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,500
Of course you think that's okay, right?

506
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:43,000
Even if you say, Munagebon, I don't know what you're talking about.

507
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Excuse me.

508
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Kyoto University.

509
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Munagebon.

510
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,000
I'm hungry.

511
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,500
There's a lot of meaning to it.

512
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,000
It's when you pass the exam.

513
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
What?

514
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,500
It's when you pass the exam.

515
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:01,000
I'm hungry?

516
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
You're hungry.

517
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,500
Isn't there something good about it?

518
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,000
In the left-hand side.

519
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
What's that?

520
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Following that, on February 18th, Hama-chan's unknown past was discovered.

521
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,000
This is a question for the president of the Japan Animal Lovers Association, Mr. Mazo.

522
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:25,000
I don't like animals, but it's said that there are a lot of evil people who hate animals.

523
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:30,000
I also want to be seen as a person who hates animals, but what should I do? Please tell me.

524
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
I see.

525
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Are there a lot of evil people who hate animals?

526
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Everyone feels that, right?

527
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:42,000
When a woman says she hates children, it's like, wow, this woman is a terrible woman.

528
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
There's a fixed concept like that, right?

529
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
What kind of person says they hate animals?

530
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
I see.

531
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,500
Right? That's different, right?

532
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:51,000
It's different.

533
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
It's difficult to say that you like it or hate it.

534
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Even if you look like this, you like animals, right?

535
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
That's right.

536
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
You really look like you're going to kill them.

537
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
I really, really like them.

538
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Even if you don't like them, it's normal, right?

539
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Seriously, if I had a bag, I'd like to put a kangaroo in it.

540
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
I like it so much that I'd like to put a kangaroo in it.

541
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Even though you're going to put it in?

542
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Even though I'm going to put it in, I like it so much that I'd like to put it in.

543
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,000
I don't hate animals that much either.

544
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Why are you pinching my nose?

545
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Stop pinching my eyes.

546
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:33,000
I've seen a lot of you doing that.

547
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
You'll get in trouble if you do that.

548
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000

00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
