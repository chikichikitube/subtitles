1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000
After all, after winning, curry is the most important.

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
It's getting a little hard.

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Huh?

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I'm hungry!

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,000
What a husky voice.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I'm hungry.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I don't know anymore.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I should have watched it at the best time.

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Welcome.

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Uh-huh.

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Are you okay?

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I'm good.

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
What are you talking about?

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Here's the guest.

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Guest.

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I think you're better.

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Excuse me, it's dance time.

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
What's this?

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Excuse me.

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Oh, my God.

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Hi.

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Hi.

23
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Hi.

24
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Welcome.

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Hahaha.

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Hi.

27
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Hi.

28
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Hi.

29
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Hi.

30
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Hi.

31
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Welcome.

32
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Hi.

33
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Hi.

34
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Hi.

35
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Hi.

36
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Uh-huh.

37
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Welcome.

38
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Uh-huh.

39
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Hahaha.

40
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I'm hungry.

41
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Hahaha.

42
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Thank you.

43
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Oh, honey.

44
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Yes.

45
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Oh, thank you.

46
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Oh, yeah.

47
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Oh, thank you.

48
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Oh, me too.

49
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Yeah.

50
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Hahaha.

51
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Thank you.

52
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Thank you.

53
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Oh, yeah.

54
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Hahaha.

55
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Yeah.

56
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Oh, yeah.

57
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Oh, yeah.

58
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Yeah.

59
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Oh, I got my nose, didn't I?

60
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Hahaha.

61
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Oh, yeah.

62
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Hahaha.

63
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Oh, yeah.

64
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I've been kissing since then.

65
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Oh, yeah.

66
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Honey.

67
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Oh, yeah.

68
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Hahaha.

69
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Oh, yeah.

70
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Hahaha.

71
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Honey, I love you.

72
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Not yet.

73
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Not yet.

74
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Not yet.

75
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Not yet.

76
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Not yet.

77
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Not yet.

78
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Not yet.

79
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Not yet.

80
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Not yet.

81
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Not yet.

82
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I'm hungry.

83
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Not yet.

84
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Not yet.

85
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Not yet.

86
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Not yet.

87
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Not yet.

88
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Not yet.

89
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Not yet.

90
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Not yet.

91
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Not yet.

92
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,480
Not yet.

93
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Hey!

94
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Hey!

95
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Hey!

96
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,500
What's wrong with you?

97
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:25,500
It's hot. I'm hungry.

98
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,500
Let me sleep.

99
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,500
I'm hungry.

100
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:35,500
Let me sleep.

101
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:38,500
I'm hungry.

102
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:42,500
You're such a wimp!

103
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,500
You're good.

104
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,500
Thank you for your hard work.

105
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,500
25,000 yen.

106
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:07,500
Everyone is putting out a lot of money.

107
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,500
If there's someone else doing it, it'll be a lot of pressure.

108
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:15,500
Suzuki will be doing it next.

109
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,500
That's the worst part.

110
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,500
It'll be next week.

111
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,500
It hurts!

112
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,500
It's been a long time since I've been to Osaka.

113
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:47,500
I was so drunk that I had to go on a typhoon.

114
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,500
I took a plane.

115
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,500
It's scary to take a plane in a typhoon.

116
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,500
It shakes.

117
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:57,500
It shakes even if there's no typhoon.

118
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,500
It was shaking all the time.

119
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:02,500
I fell twice.

120
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,500
That was dangerous.

121
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,500
From the back.

122
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,500
That was dangerous.

123
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,500
I fell from my head.

124
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,500
That was good.

125
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,500
I fell from my back.

126
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,500
You've seen it.

127
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,500
The tire was on top and I fell.

128
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,500
I'll have to bring it back.

129
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,500
I couldn't move my legs.

130
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,500
I hit my head.

131
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,500
I have a little cerebral palsy.

132
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,500
But I can still move my legs.

133
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,500
It's scary.

134
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,500
There's no point in going in from the day before.

135
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,500
There is.

136
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:49,500
Why are you so desperate in a typhoon?

137
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,500
If you're desperate, you should go to Osaka.

138
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,500
I fell twice.

139
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:57,500
There's no reason for you to go to Osaka.

140
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,500
I'll go to Osaka.

141
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,500
Why?

142
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,500
I'll go to Osaka.

143
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,500
There's no reason for you to go to Osaka.

144
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,500
I want to cry.

145
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,500
Why are you crying?

146
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,500
Why are you crying?

147
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,500
Osaka has a lot of good food.

148
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,500
You went to Osaka at night.

149
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,500
I just wanted to eat something delicious.

150
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:22,500
I can't sleep in a hotel.

151
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,500
I sleep on the bed.

152
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,500
How do you sleep at home?

153
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,500
I sleep on a futon.

154
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,500
Do you sleep on a futon?

155
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,500
Yes.

156
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,500
I can't wake you up.

157
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,500
I don't sleep on a bed either.

158
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,500
But I can sleep in a hotel.

159
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:43,500
That's not true.

160
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:46,500
You can hear something, right?

161
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,500
What?

162
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:50,500
The sound of a refrigerator in a hotel.

163
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,500
Is that so?

164
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,500
You can hear it.

165
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,500
What are you worried about?

166
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,500
You can't say it all the time.

167
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,500
You don't know if you got the right answer.

168
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,500
You can calm down once.

169
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,500
This is it.

170
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,500
You don't know if you got the right answer.

171
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,500
You don't know if you got the right answer.

172
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,500
You are worried about the second question.

173
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,500
That's good.

174
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,500
I'm not sleepy.

175
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:19,500
You are not sleepy.

176
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,500
There must be something.

177
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,500
Is that so?

178
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,500
I was in Osaka the other day.

179
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,500
I thought I was going to sleep.

180
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,500
Suddenly my nose.

181
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,500
My nose started to say.

182
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:36,500
This is about your body.

183
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:39,500
It has nothing to do with the surroundings.

184
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:44,500
When I went to Hong Kong as a kid, you were sleeping.

185
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,500
I can't sleep in a hotel.

186
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,500
I got a dream.

187
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,500
When Jimmy came in.

188
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,500
I was close to home.

189
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,500
What?

190
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,500
I calmed down.

191
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,500
You were close to home?

192
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:06,500
What do you mean?

193
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,500
What are you talking about?

194
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:12,500
I was at the Nichio Theater.

195
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,500
Nichio Theater in Toshiba?

196
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,500
Nichio Theater in Toshiba.

197
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,500
I was there for a while.

198
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,500
I was there for a while.

199
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,500
Higashi.

200
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,500
The boy band.

201
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,500
That's cool.

202
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,500
That's right.

203
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,500
The legend of the big melon.

204
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,500
I don't like the song.

205
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:30,500
Higashi may be hard to understand.

206
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,500
Everyone knows Higashi.

207
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,500
It's easier to understand if you say the legend of the melon.

208
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,500
That's complicated.

209
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,500
It's not a legend.

210
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,500
It's not transmitted.

211
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,500
It's not transmitted to anyone.

212
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,500
He's the only one who says it.

213
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,500
It's a mess.

214
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,500
I was involved with Higashi.

215
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,500
I see.

216
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,500
We were rehearsing.

217
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,500
I went to see him for the first time.

218
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,500
I was involved with Higashi.

219
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:52,500
Everyone was looking at me.

220
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,500
I was wondering why.

221
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,500
Who were you looking at?

222
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,500
Itao.

223
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:56,500
Itao.

224
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,500
I took a taxi.

225
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,500
A shirt came out.

226
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,500
Like this.

227
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,500
That's why everyone was looking at me.

228
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,500
Why?

229
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,500
I looked closely.

230
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,500
There was poop on my shirt.

231
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,500
That's not good.

232
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,500
That's not good this year either.

233
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,500
It's not over.

234
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,500
That's what it is.

235
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,500
I touched my dick.

236
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:31,500
Have you ever touched your dick?

237
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,500
I'm sorry.

238
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,500
There are many beautiful stories.

239
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,500
Matsumoto's beautiful story.

240
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,500
Everyone in America knows it.

241
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:47,500
Please tell me the story of when you rescued a child from a building in New York.

242
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,500
That's...

243
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,500
Hey!

244
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,500
What do you think the timing is?

245
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:58,500
I rescued a person.

246
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,500
Yes.

247
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,500
Why is your face different?

248
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,500
Rescue.

249
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,500
Rescue.

250
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,500
What kind of situation was this?

251
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:10,500
I went on a trip to America.

252
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,500
I was walking.

253
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,500
I didn't see anything.

254
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,500
Where were you walking?

255
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,500
The station building.

256
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,500
What?

257
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,500
The station building?

258
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,500
It's in front of the station.

259
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,500
What is a station building?

260
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,500
I was walking there.

261
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,500
Where is the station building?

262
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,500
I was walking.

263
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,500
Happen! Happen!

264
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,500
Happening! Happening!

265
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,500
I'm sorry.

266
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:43,500
I looked up and saw something amazing.

267
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,500
What?

268
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,500
What?

269
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,500
What do you mean by amazing?

270
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:51,500
There was a child.

271
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,500
In front of the window?

272
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:57,500
Yes, in front of the window.

273
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:58,500
It was a miracle.

274
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:02,500
Why miracle?

275
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,500
Nothing has started and nothing has ended.

276
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,500
Why miracle?

277
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:10,500
I was told to help me.

278
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:14,500
I didn't come to America with that intention.

279
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:17,500
I told my mother that I would go.

280
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,500
What did you say?

281
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:22,500
Rescue! Rescue!

282
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:26,500
When I said rescue, the child said,

283
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:31,500
Power down! Power down!

284
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:34,500
It's all words.

285
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:40,500
Game over! Game over!

286
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:44,500
It's all words.

287
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,500
Hey boy! Hey boy!

288
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,500
Hey boy! Hey boy!

289
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:51,500
Why?

290
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:54,500
It's all words.

291
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,500
I was told to help me.

292
00:13:56,500 --> 00:14:00,500
It's all words.

293
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:03,500
It's all words.

294
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:06,500
It's all words.

295
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:15,500
I said, Oh, it's great!

296
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:21,500
Oh, cutie!

297
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:26,500
A fool can't help a fool.

298
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,500
It was amazing.

299
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:31,500
It was a three-story building.

300
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,500
You can't fall down!

301
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:36,500
The three-story building is the scariest.

302
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,500
It's not scary.

303
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,500
It's a real height.

304
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:44,500
You're living with a fake family, right?

305
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:49,500
Go away!

306
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:55,500
Where did you go to the station building?

307
00:14:55,500 --> 00:15:00,500
I've been stuck in the subway door in a stupid way.

308
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,500
It's best not to get stuck.

309
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:11,500
If you get stuck, please tell me how to escape.

310
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:14,500
You've never been stuck, have you?

311
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,500
I've never been stuck.

312
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:22,500
But if I get stuck, I can do this and that.

313
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:26,500
Please tell me how to escape.

314
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,500
How to get stuck.

315
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:31,500
Of course there's a cool way to get stuck.

316
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,500
Please tell me.

317
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,500
How do you get stuck?

318
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,500
If you go in like this...

319
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:39,500
Oh, like this?

320
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,500
I always get stuck.

321
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:43,500
I don't get stuck like this.

322
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,500
I have a hand.

323
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,500
I know.

324
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:48,500
You have to go in like this.

325
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:49,500
I know.

326
00:15:49,500 --> 00:16:02,500
You have to go in like this.

327
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:06,500
You don't even have to use a bow.

328
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,500
I think it's cool.

329
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,500
You're stuck and you're like this.

330
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,500
You're going to move like this, right?

331
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,500
That's right.

332
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:17,500
It's cool, but...

333
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:21,500
The people around you are crazy.

334
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:25,500
If you get stuck once, you'll be able to get out.

335
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,500
If you get stuck once, you'll be able to get out, right?

336
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:28,500
You'll be able to get out.

337
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:31,500
It's cool to get stuck.

338
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,500
That's right.

339
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:33,500
Because you're able to get out.

340
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,500
That's right.

341
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,500
It's a way to get out.

342
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:40,500
You have to be careful not to get stuck.

343
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,500
What the hell are you talking about?

344
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,500
Wait a minute.

345
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:46,500
If you're going to get stuck, let's be honest.

346
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,500
That's not cool.

347
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,500
You don't know that?

348
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,500
That's not cool.

349
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,500
It's the same with bugs.

350
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:54,500
If you put a bug in a basket and open it, it'll run away.

351
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,500
That's not cool.

352
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:59,500
If you're proud of that, you'll be like, what?

353
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,500
It's like a beetle.

354
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,500
But you really want to run away, right?

355
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,500
I really want to run away.

356
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:08,500
That's why I'm trying to go when it goes like this.

357
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,500
I can't close it.

358
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:13,500
I have to do it more.

359
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,500
Why does it hurt?

360
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:18,500
I'm fine like this.

361
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:21,500
You don't have to show it there.

362
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,500
You don't have to show it there.

363
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,500
If you get stuck, it'll open up.

364
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,500
It'll open up?

365
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,500
Yes, yes, yes.

366
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:32,500
It's better not to think you're stuck for the first time.

367
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:35,500
I'm like this.

368
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,500
Yes, yes, yes.

369
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,500
Do you understand?

370
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,500
Yes, yes, yes.

371
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,500
If you get stuck, it'll open up.

372
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,500
Yes, yes, yes.

373
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:46,500
It'll open up, so go around the door and don't go back.

374
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,500
What are you doing?

375
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:01,500
This is a question for Komuro Tetsuya's assistant, Matsumoto.

376
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:04,500
Please write the school's chime in Matsumoto style.

377
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:08,500
There are lyrics in the book.

378
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:12,500
I'm not saying it's part of the song or lyrics.

379
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,500
I'm just not saying it out loud.

380
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:17,500
All of the lyrics are included.

381
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,500
But the school's chime isn't included.

382
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,500
It is.

383
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:31,500
There's something like pride of the throat, right?

384
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,500
You are great.

385
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:36,500
Wait a minute.

386
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:39,500
It's a bit of a shame!

387
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,500
It's a bit of a shame to talk about youth!

388
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,500
Yes, yes, yes.

389
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,500
What is Chaim?

390
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,500
What is Chaim?

391
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,500
Chaim is a bit different depending on the school.

392
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,500
King Kong, Kong Kong, King Kong, Kong Kong, right?

393
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,500
Yes, yes, yes.

394
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,500
Yes, yes, yes.

395
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,500
Please teach me the C of this.

396
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,500
Ah, I will teach you.

397
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:06,500
You guys...

398
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:09,500
Why are you singing with a soft touch?

399
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,500
It's normal!

400
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,500
It's this kind of intonation, right?

401
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,500
Ah, well, yes.

402
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:20,500
You guys...

403
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:25,500
Right now...

404
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,500
What?

405
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,500
What?

406
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,500
What does it mean by, now?

407
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,500
What?

408
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,500
It's not even the part you'll sing yet?

409
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:34,500
King Kong Kong Kong Kong!

410
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:35,500
King Kong Kong Kong!

411
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,500
King Kong Kong Kong!

412
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,500
King Kong Kong Kong Kong!

413
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,500
It ends at King Kong Kong Kong, right?

414
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,500
King Kong Kong Kong!

415
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,500
King...

416
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,500
King...

417
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,500
King...

418
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,500
Right?

419
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:48,500
That's it!

420
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:49,500
Really, really.

421
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,500
Really?

422
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:51,500
Really, really.

423
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,500
Well, that's fine.

424
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:53,500
Yes, yes, yes.

425
00:19:53,500 --> 00:20:02,500
You guys, now is the time to go on a journey

426
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,500
Hey!

427
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,500
You're going to do the tatami, right?

428
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:15,500
Lupin is a man

429
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,500
Just like that

430
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:21,500
Fujiko is a woman

431
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,500
Just like that

432
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:27,500
Please explain it clearly

433
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,500
There's that

434
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,500
Lupin is a man

435
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:34,500
