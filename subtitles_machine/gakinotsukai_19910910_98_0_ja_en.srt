1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Chikichiki Akitani Kakuzan Hayaguni Ooguitaitai!

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Are you a monkey?

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Akitani Kakuzan Hayaguni Ooguitaitai

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Today we have prepared a box.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
We have prepared from 1 to 8.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Please choose a number you like.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Let's start with what's in the box.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Let's say it's 1 minute.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
The person who eats the fastest in 1 minute wins.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
And the person who wins last will get a wonderful prize.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
That's how it is.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
What should we do?

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
There are two rounds.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
There are two rounds?

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Yes.

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I want to choose number 1.

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
You choose number 1.

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I choose number 5.

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
You choose number 5.

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I choose number 8.

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Let's start.

22
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
The person who eats the fastest in 1 minute wins.

23
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
This is tough.

24
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
This is really tough.

25
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
It's noisy.

26
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Number 5.

27
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Noriyasu, please choose number 8.

28
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Wow!

29
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
What is that?

30
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
It's a jumbo rice ball.

31
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
The person who eats the fastest in 1 minute wins.

32
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Please eat as much as you can.

33
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Do you understand?

34
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You have 30 seconds to answer.

35
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Not 1 minute, but 30 seconds.

36
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
How do you calculate this?

37
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
If you drink 1 bottle cleanly, it's 1 bottle.

38
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Oh, I see.

39
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
It's no use even if you drink slowly.

40
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
By the way, how do you win and lose?

41
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I only drink milk.

42
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Is this 1 bottle?

43
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I don't know. I don't watch TV.

44
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
It's disgusting.

45
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Noriyasu, it's disgusting.

46
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I'm sorry.

47
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Don't spit it out.

48
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Don't spit it out, idiot.

49
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
It's over.

50
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Yamazaki, 1, 2, 3.

51
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Let's admit that it's 3.

52
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Noriyasu, it's 4.

53
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
It's half and 1 squid.

54
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Noriyasu wins.

55
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I don't know how much Matsumoto ate.

56
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
The first round is over.

57
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
My staff wants to drink a lot of milk.

58
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
What do you mean?

59
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
You're going to be killed.

60
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
You said you couldn't stand it.

61
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I remember.

62
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
You don't remember?

63
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
What's your name?

64
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Moriyama.

65
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Moriyama.

66
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Moriyama.

67
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Ready, start.

68
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Is my salary low?

69
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
It's over.

70
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

71
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
It's 5.

72
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Idiot.

73
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
It's amazing.

74
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
My throat is dry.

75
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Let's start the second round.

76
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:40,000
It's over.

77
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
It's over.

78
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Stop.

79
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
And then...

80
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
You did your best.

81
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
But it's not good.

82
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Noriyasu wins.

83
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Thank you.

84
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Noriyasu has won twice.

85
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
It's amazing.

86
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
There's something amazing.

87
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
What do you think?

88
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
You can give him the rights.

89
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I'm sorry.

90
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I don't know anything about it.

91
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
But please forgive me if I get it right.

92
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Okay.

93
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
If you get it right, I'll give it to you.

94
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
No.

95
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
No.

96
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Wait a minute.

97
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
It's a friendly product.

98
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
What's wrong with it?

99
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I'm sorry.

100
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
It's okay.

101
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Noriyasu.

102
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
The pig's face.

103
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
It's amazing.

104
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Yamazaki has got the rights.

105
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
You didn't get it right.

106
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
It's you.

107
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
It can't be helped.

108
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Come here.

109
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Open it.

110
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
What is it?

111
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
What is it?

112
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
What is it?

113
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
What is it?

114
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
What is it?

115
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
What is it?

116
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
It's alive.

117
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
It's Mutsugoro.

118
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Mutsugoro's Sugatayaki.

119
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
This is the real thing.

120
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I've cooked it.

121
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Please try it.

122
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
It's good.

123
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
What's wrong with him?

124
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Do you know that you're doing this in front of me?

125
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Yes.

126
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Can you do this?

127
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I can.

128
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I can.

129
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Can you do this?

130
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I can.

131
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I can.

132
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I can.

133
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I can.

134
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I can.

135
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I'm sure of it.

136
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
You should say that.

137
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Ladies and gentlemen.

138
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Don't you think it's a little strange?

139
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Last week...

140
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
As promised.

141
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Last week, I promised to change my clothes.

142
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I always wear a hat, and Masamune-kun wears a suit.

143
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
It's not funny.

144
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
That's right.

145
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I got a letter asking me to change my clothes.

146
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Today I'm wearing his clothes.

147
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
He's wearing my clothes.

148
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
What do you think?

149
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
It's crumpled.

150
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
It's nice.

151
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I'm wearing the same tie as usual.

152
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
It looks nice and long, doesn't it?

153
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
It's nice and long.

154
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
It's long, isn't it?

155
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
You're doing what you're supposed to do.

156
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
So I have to change my standing position, right?

157
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Let's change your standing position.

158
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I always change my standing position.

159
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
The person who turned on the TV just now might think it's strange.

160
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Is it okay?

161
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Can you show it to me when you forget?

162
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
That's right.

163
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
With a telop.

164
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
With a telop.

165
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
My costume is the opposite today.

166
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
It's the opposite.

167
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
If you don't show it to me, I'll think it's my hobby.

168
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
No, no, no.

169
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
When I do this, you should talk.

170
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
No, no, no.

171
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Before I talk...

172
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
No, no, no.

173
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
No, no, no.

174
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
That's strange.

175
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
You don't have to imitate that.

176
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I'm sorry, but I can't change my standing position.

177
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
No, no, no.

178
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
No, no, no.

179
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
No, no, no.

180
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
No, no, no.

181
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
No, no, no.

182
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
No, no, no.

183
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
No, no, no.

184
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
No, no, no.

185
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
No, no, no.

186
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
No, no, no.

187
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
No, no, no.

188
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
No, no, no.

189
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I can't talk if you touch me.

190
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
You're going to talk.

191
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I'm doing it 100 times more than you.

192
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
You're doing it.

193
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,000
But I'm always wearing a hat like this.

194
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Why?

195
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I feel strange.

196
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
It's strange.

197
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
This is a mistake.

198
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Then I'll wear it a little deeper.

199
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Wait.

200
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Wait.

201
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Wait.

202
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Why are you taking it off?

203
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Why?

204
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Why are you taking it off?

205
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Why are you taking it off?

206
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
That's right.

207
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
You're doing it.

208
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
But this is hot.

209
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
You're doing this.

210
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Well, that's fine.

211
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Well, let's get started.

212
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
That's right.

213
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Well, let's get started.

214
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
It's hot.

215
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
It's hot in this hall today.

216
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
The summer vacation is finally over.

217
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Yes.

218
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Do you have any fun memories of the summer vacation?

219
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
No.

220
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
No?

221
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
There's no vacation.

222
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Oh, really?

223
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
The only thing that's open is that I'm going to get my driver's license again.

224
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Yes.

225
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
All the time.

226
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Sayonara.

227
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
You're going to get your driver's license now.

228
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I'm worried if you say something real when you get your driver's license.

229
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Why?

230
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
You're going to get your license.

231
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I don't care.

232
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I don't care.

233
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I'm not going to let you get your driver's license.

234
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Don't say that.

235
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I'm not going to let you get your driver's license.

236
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I'm not going to let you get your driver's license.

237
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
If you don't have a driver's license, it's going to be hard.

238
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
That's fine.

239
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
If you suddenly ask me to get my driver's license.

240
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I went to the public school for two days for that.

241
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I treated you like a criminal.

242
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I'm going to get my license.

243
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
You shouldn't be a police officer.

244
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
You shouldn't be a police officer.

245
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Why?

246
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
You probably can't broadcast this.

247
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
But it's funny, so I'll say it.

248
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
There's a firework show.

249
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
It's going to be on the media.

250
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
You shouldn't be a police officer.

251
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
It's not on the media.

252
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
If there's a main character, we'll never do it.

253
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
There's a firework show.

254
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
There's a firework show.

255
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
That was the first time.

256
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
There were a few of them.

257
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
The first one was on fire.

258
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I thought it was beautiful.

259
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I thought I'd do it next time.

260
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I was preparing for the next one.

261
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I looked at it.

262
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
It was burning.

263
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I thought someone was burning it.

264
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I thought someone was burning it.

265
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I thought someone was burning it.

266
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
That's why you're aiming for it.

267
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
That's why you're aiming for it.

268
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
What?

269
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I didn't know that.

270
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Did you catch fire?

271
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
It's burning in the grass.

272
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
It's burning in the grass?

273
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
The grass is burning.

274
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
What should I do?

275
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
What should I do?

276
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Should I put it out?

277
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,000
When we all went, it was burning like this.

278
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
One of us was naked.

279
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I thought it wouldn't be funny.

280
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I did it with my clothes on.

281
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I couldn't cut it at all.

282
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,000
It's burning.

283
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I noticed it.

284
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
It's burning in this hole.

285
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
It's burning in this hole.

286
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Don't say anything.

287
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
It's burning in this hole.

288
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
In the grass?

289
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
In the grass.

290
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:22,000
What should I do?

291
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
It's like a lie.

292
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Really?

293
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
It's amazing.

294
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
What should I do?

295
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,000
What should I do?

296
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Five firefighters came.

297
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
What should I do?

298
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
It's dangerous if you run away.

299
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Everyone, look away.

300
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
It's burning like this.

301
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Everyone, look away.

302
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
The firecrackers are coming.

303
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Is there anyone who got hurt in this fire?

304
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I'm asking you.

305
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
No one got hurt, right?

306
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Or if there's a firework here, put a name right away.

307
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Everyone, let's go.

308
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.

309
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.

310
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I wanted to express the feeling of running away in a single car.

311
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Everyone ran away.

312
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Did you go after that?

313
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
No, I went to see the next morning.

314
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
What's going on?

315
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
The criminal returns to the scene.

316
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Don't tell anyone.

317
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
It's my secret after you.

318
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Oh, I'm going to the police station now.

319
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
When can I get it?

320
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
The next one is...

321
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I think it's a verification.

322
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Well, there's also a identification.

323
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Be careful.

324
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Why?

325
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I was dropped once by that.

326
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Why?

327
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I can't forget.

328
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000
If I get this last one, I'll pass.

329
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I was running.

330
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:54,000
When I was running, a sparrow stopped in front of me.

331
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
What's going on?

332
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I thought I shouldn't pull the sparrow, so I stepped on the brake.

333
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Then the instructor said,

334
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Why don't you stop meaninglessly?

335
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Now the sparrow is...

336
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Now the sparrow is gone.

337
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
That's right.

338
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I'm in front of you.

339
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,000
You stepped on the brake meaninglessly.

340
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
You're not going to stop, are you?

341
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
That's what he wrote.

342
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
And then I was dropped.

343
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
One verification?

344
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
That's what happens, so be careful.

345
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I see.

346
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,000
If I were a sparrow, I'd have a lot of guts.

347
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:36,000
If I were a sparrow, I'd have a lot of guts.

348
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
That's right.

349
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
When can I get it?

350
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,000
If you pass the verification, you have 10 hours left on the street.

351
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
That's what happens.

352
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I hope I can get it by September.

353
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I don't have time to go.

354
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
How about this?

355
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
What?

356
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I'm going to support your graduation with this viewer.

357
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
No way!

358
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Don't get in my way!

359
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Why?

360
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
No way!

361
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Why?

362
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Just do it quietly.

363
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:12,000
At the end of the street, when there are people on the crosswalk, the car won't stop.

364
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
They'll go all the way.

365
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:19,000
That's why all the people watching this show are on the crosswalk.

366
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Welcome.

367
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Hello.

368
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
You look like a professional today.

369
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Yes.

370
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:33,000
You have glasses like Hiroshi.

371
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
What's your name?

372
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I'm Michiru Tanioka.

373
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Do you have a job?

374
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Yes.

375
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
What is it?

376
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I'm an assistant in a TV show.

377
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
What kind of TV show is it?

378
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I don't watch it at all.

379
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,000
It's a TV show about the supermarket.

380
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
What?

381
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
That TV show?

382
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
What's that?

383
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
It's a TV show about the supermarket.

384
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,000
That's a TV show about the supermarket.

385
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
It's a TV show about the supermarket.

386
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
The producer is the same as the producer of this TV show.

387
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
The producer of this TV show and the producer of that TV show are the same?

388
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
They are the same.

389
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
What's your name?

390
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I'm Suga.

391
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Is Suga doing that?

392
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
He's doing it proudly.

393
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
What's the number of that TV show?

394
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:28,000
It's that one.

395
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Thank you very much.

396
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Is it okay like this?

397
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
It doesn't make sense to bring this and bring this home.

398
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
It doesn't make sense.

399
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:41,000
The other day, I opened a postcard.

400
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I read it every week.

401
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I'm looking forward to the 100th anniversary.

402
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Today, I have a question for you.

403
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Why do you call Kyoko Suizenji a cheater?

404
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
It's strange. I can't sleep at night. Please tell me.

405
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I read the postcard the other day.

406
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I don't know the answer.

407
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Why do you call Kyoko Suizenji a cheater?

408
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Let's see.

409
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Happiness doesn't come by walking.

410
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
That's why we walk.

411
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Hello.

412
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I'm happy to be able to walk.

413
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Thank you for your question.

414
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,000
It's written in this postcard that I'm quick-witted.

415
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
But it doesn't matter.

416
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
It's an old story.

417
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
He wasn't born yet.

418
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Even if I make my debut,

419
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
It's a nickname I got when I couldn't make my debut.

420
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Even if I make my debut,

421
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
My real name is Tamiko.

422
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I'll never forget the feeling of being a little Tamiko.

423
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
That's why I'm a cheater.

424
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
That's the real meaning.

425
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
This is me.

426
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
It's not Seiko Matsuda.

427
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
This is me.

428
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:05,000
This part is written in English.

429
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Young man, I'm counting on you.

430
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,000
That's why I'm working hard.

431
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
If you have any questions,

432
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I'll answer them right away.

433
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
It's really hot today.

434
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
This person's pen name is Hama-chan Saikou.

435
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Thank you.

436
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:38,000
You're a little crazy, aren't you?

437
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,000
He's angry.

438
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
He's angry, Hama-chan.

439
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Hama-chan Saikou.

440
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
What are you?

441
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Are you that amazing?

442
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
If it's this girl,

443
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
If it's this girl,

444
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:00,000
How can you call such an amazing person Hama-chan?

445
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Isn't it okay?

446
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
It's love.

447
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
What?

448
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Are you still angry?

449
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Don't read it.

450
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Matsumoto Hama, how are you?

451
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
What?

452
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I listen to Shizuka Kudo's radio every week.

453
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
On that radio, it was a downtown story.

454
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Kudo-san said,

455
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I like matcha.

456
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Because it's interesting.

457
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I'm going to wear a burma and play dodgeball.

458
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
It was a long time ago.

459
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:36,000
At that time, I thought I'd wear a purple burma and go.

460
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I was going to go to the studio next time.

461
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Please do an interesting project that will surprise Kudo-san, who is such a big fan.

462
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
I see.

463
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
If you wear it, I don't have money for this program.

464
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
A postcard carrier.

465
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
A postcard carrier?

466
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
That's right, but I don't have money.

467
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I don't know.

468
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Really?

469
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
If it's open, I'll wear it.

470
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
100th anniversary.

471
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
That's right.

472
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
100th anniversary.

473
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I don't know if that's possible.

474
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Live broadcast.

475
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
But the time is slow.

476
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
It's 740 minutes.

477
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
It's live.

478
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
100th anniversary.

479
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I'll do it live.

480
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
The time is slow in the morning, so it may be impossible.

481
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
It's 1 hour 40 minutes.

482
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Who else wants to go?

483
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
So let's ask.

484
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Ken Takakura.

485
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
He won't come.

486
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
He won't come.

487
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
What if he comes?

488
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
If he comes, I'll ask him to carry me.

489
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Ken Takakura.

490
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:41,000
I'm a martial arts master.

491
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
If he comes, I'll ask him to carry me.

492
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Don't ask Ken Takakura.

493
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I don't care.

494
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
I don't care if you ask him to carry you.

495
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
I went to Tetsuko's room today.

496
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Tetsuko's room.

497
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,000
I saw Tetsuko.

498
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,000
I didn't see Tetsuko.

499
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Let's go home.

500
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Yes.

501
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Let's go home.

502
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
He said yes.

503
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Why don't you two talk here?

504
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
I don't have anything.

505
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I'm sorry.

506
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
I was a little excited.

507
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
What are you talking about?

508
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Let's go home.

509
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,000
I haven't been here for a long time.

510
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
I don't know where to go.

511
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
It's already 9 o'clock.

512
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:43,000
I have to leave by 9 o'clock.

513
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Say something.

514
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Seriously.

515
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Let's go home.

516
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Let's go home.

517
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
If you have time, hurry up.

518
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Let's go home.

519
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,000
It looks delicious.

520
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Don't laugh.

521
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Goodbye.

522
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
It's dark.

523
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Really?

524
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Really?

525
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Really?

526
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Hello.

527
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
I have an announcement to make.

528
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
On Tuesday, September 24th,

529
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:24,000
we will have a live broadcast to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Gaki no Tsukai.

530
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
On Tuesday, September 24th,

531
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
we will have a live broadcast at 1.40 p.m.

532
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:34,000
The person who is doing this now is Honjamaka.

533
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
I like Honjamaka these days.

534
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
No, no, no.

535
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
It's true.

536
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
So it's either me or Honjamaka.

537
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
So I'll do it.

538
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
I'll do it.

539
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
If you want to watch it,

540
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I want you to send me a letter.

541
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:59,000
However, the broadcast will be from 1.40 p.m. to 2.10 p.m.

542
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
I'll leave it to the person who can buy it.

543
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Since it's a 100th anniversary, I want you to wear a 100-day outfit.

544
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
I'll leave it to the person who can buy it.

545
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
I see.

546
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
I want you to wear a 100-day outfit.

547
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
That's it.

548
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
I see.

549
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Please send me a letter.

550
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
I'll do it.

551
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
I'll do it.

552
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
After Honjamaka.

553
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
You're so persistent with Honjamaka.

554
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Honjamaka is good.
