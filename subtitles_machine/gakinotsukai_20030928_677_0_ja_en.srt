1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
What should we do?

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Excuse me.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Good morning.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Good morning.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Excuse me.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Yamasaki-san said,

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
If you can come, then come.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Who are you talking to?

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Who?

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
To everyone.

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
What are you saying?

12
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
If you can come, then come.

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Who cares?

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
What's with you guys?

15
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
What's wrong with you?

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Who are you talking to?

17
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Who cares?

18
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
If you can come, then come.

19
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Who are you talking to?

20
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
If you can come, then come.

21
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Don't tell me you remember the second one from before?

22
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Oh, really?

23
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
That's right.

24
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
There was one like Yamazaki Quest.

25
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
That's an illustration.

26
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
That's not Yamazaki Quest.

27
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Please come to the center.

28
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
It's been a long time since I've been here.

29
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,000
This time, I came to the Golden Land of Gizu, Jibang, rather than Harubaru France.

30
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I'll give you a chance to be lucky.

31
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
This is the first time I've been to the Golden Land of Gizu, Jibang.

32
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
It's been a long time since I've been to the Golden Land of Gizu.

33
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'll give you a chance to be lucky.

34
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You can meet the Golden Gold Coins from the Golden Land of Gizu, Jibang.

35
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,000
You can meet the Golden Gold Coins from the Golden Land of Gizu, Jibang.

36
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Golden...

37
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
You have to solve the mystery I thought of.

38
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I'll give you the first hint.

39
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I'll help you solve the mystery of the veteran ninja who is injured.

40
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
It's better to mix it up.

41
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
It's better to mix it up.

42
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
This program is brought to you by the sponsor you are watching.

43
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
You'll be surprised.

44
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Good morning.

45
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Good morning.

46
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I don't need money.

47
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I'll give you money.

48
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
It's warm.

49
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
It's warm, but it's hot.

50
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
The white thing that's been injured.

51
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
It's true.

52
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
It's a big deal.

53
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I don't know if it's that injured.

54
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
What's wrong?

55
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
He died because he was hit by a kappa.

56
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
What is it?

57
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
What is it?

58
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Oh, that's it.

59
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
There's a kappa.

60
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
My father was hit by a kappa and fell down.

61
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
That's what he said.

62
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
There's a kappa, right?

63
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
That's right.

64
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
That's right.

65
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Do you fly kappa?

66
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
It's a big deal.

67
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
It's a big deal.

68
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Are you okay?

69
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I'm in the mood to do this.

70
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Do you want to fly?

71
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
It's a big deal.

72
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
It's a big deal.

73
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
It's a big deal.

74
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
It's a big deal.

75
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
It's a big deal.

76
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Get on the kappa.

77
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
It's a big deal.

78
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
It's pretty cold.

79
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
It's cold.

80
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
That's hot.

81
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Get on the kappa.

82
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
It's very cold.

83
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
It's very cold.

84
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
It's a big deal.

85
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
It's a big deal.

86
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
It's a big deal.

87
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Get on the kappa.

88
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Get on the kappa.

89
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Did you do it?

90
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
It's a big deal.

91
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Let's go!

92
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Let's go!

93
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Let's go!

94
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Let's go!

95
00:04:42,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Let's go!

96
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Let's go!

97
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Let's go!

98
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
How many do you have?

99
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I have four.

100
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I have three.

101
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I'm sick of it.

102
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I want to go home.

103
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I can see the monitor.

104
00:05:40,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I'm sick of it.

105
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:16,000
It seems that the samurai got the first piece of the coin.

106
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I will tell you the way you should go.

107
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I will tell you the way you should go.

108
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I'm sick of it.

109
00:06:52,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I will tell you the way you should go.

110
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I will tell you the way you should go.

111
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I will tell you the way you should go.

112
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I will tell you the way you should go.

113
00:07:50,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I will tell you the way you should go.

114
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I will tell you the way you should go.

115
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I will tell you the way you should go.

116
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I will tell you the way you should go.

117
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Okay.

118
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Was it scary?

119
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:55,500
Yes.

120
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:56,500
Was it scary?

121
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,500
No, it wasn't.

122
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,500
This is teamwork.

123
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,500
The letters are probably different.

124
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,500
Right?

125
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,500
I'm scared.

126
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,000
No, stop it.

127
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I'm scared.

128
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
No, you can't do that.

129
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
You can't take the coin.

130
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,000
I'm scared.

131
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
How many are there?

132
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Four, right?

133
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Four.

134
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
It's the last one.

135
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
It's over.

136
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Go and get it.

137
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
It's the last one.

138
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
You're not going to do it, are you?

139
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I'm going for the third one.

140
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Look.

141
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
What?

142
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Children can also enjoy it, right?

143
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I'm scared.

144
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
What are you talking about?

145
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
What are you talking about?

146
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I'm not going to run away.

147
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Was it that scary?

148
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
It's like a horror movie.

149
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
That's right.

150
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
How long have you been waiting here?

151
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
How long have you been waiting here?

152
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
You're trying to make me do this.

153
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Stop it.

154
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I'm going to run away.

155
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I'm not going to run away.

156
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
It's going to take about 10 minutes.

157
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I'll follow you.

158
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Should I lie down?

159
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
That's right.

160
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Either way is fine, but lying down is faster.

161
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I can't run fast.

162
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
What are you doing?

163
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I don't like that kind of ad-lib.

164
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Please watch it.

165
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
It's coming.

166
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:54,000
It's coming.

167
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Don't run fast.

168
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
It's coming.

169
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Did you see it?

170
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Did you see it?

171
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
You saw it perfectly.

172
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Did you see it?

173
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
It's a pirate.

174
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
It's a pirate.

175
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
It's a pirate.

176
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
That's it.

177
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
It's definitely a pirate.

178
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I called you a pirate.

179
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I don't know.

180
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I don't know.

181
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I don't know.

182
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
It's a pirate.

183
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
It's a pirate.

184
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I don't know.

185
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I'm looking for coins like this.

186
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I don't know.

187
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
It's coming back.

188
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
It's a pirate.

189
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
It's a pirate.

190
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
It's a pirate.

191
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
It's a pirate.

192
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
It's a pirate.

193
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
It's a pirate.

194
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
It's a pirate.

195
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
It's coming.

196
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:39,000
It's a pirate.

197
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
The castle is full of rumors about you.

198
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I want to see you.

199
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,000
But I can't go out.

200
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I'm already 14 years old.

201
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I'm a great man.

202
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I'll tell you what's going on in the castle.

203
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,000
What's in the box?

204
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:12,000
There's a lot, but I wonder which one it is.

205
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
What's in the box?

206
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
There's a lot, but I wonder which one it is.

207
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Please put it in.

208
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Let's play the Chichi game with four people.

209
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:32,000
The loser will find the treasure box.

210
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
What do you mean Chichi game?

211
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Chichi no Ichi

212
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
That's amazing.

213
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Did you think about this game?

214
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Chichi no Zero

215
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Chichi no Ichi

216
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Chichi no Zero

217
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
End

218
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:04,000
The game is called Hayakidori.

219
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
That's the worst.

220
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:12,000
The game is called Hayakidori.

221
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
It's shaking.

222
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
That's great.

223
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I'm going to die if I get on it.

224
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
It's shaking.

225
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I'm going to die if I get on it.

226
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Are you okay?

227
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I'm not okay.

228
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Can you see anything?

229
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I can see it.

230
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Please do your best.

231
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I'm scared.

232
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
What's this?

233
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I don't want to go alone.

234
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Wait a minute.

235
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
It's raining a lot.

236
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Wait a minute.

237
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Wait a minute.

238
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:58,000
It's going up to a very high place.

239
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Wait a minute.

240
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I'm dead.

241
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Wait a minute.

242
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
What's this?

243
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:26,000
There's no end.

244
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:31,000
The game is over.

245
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
End is crying.

246
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Can you see it?

247
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Can't you see it?

248
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I saw it.

249
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
What was it?

250
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I'll take you there.

251
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Did you see it?

252
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
What did it say?

253
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Let's move to the place where we saw it.

254
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Did you really see it?

255
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I can see it.

256
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Are you sure?

257
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I'll tell you.

258
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,000
What did it say?

259
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I can't see anything.

260
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Please give me a hint.

261
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:12,000
It's a sparrow.

262
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I saw a sparrow.

263
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Please check it out.

264
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Why?

265
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I'm serious.

266
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
What is this?

267
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
What is this?

268
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
This is a sparrow.

269
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
This is a sparrow.

270
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I want to choose a sparrow.

271
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I can only choose one.

272
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Please open it.

273
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Let's choose this one.

274
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Please open it.

275
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
This is a sparrow.

276
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
This is not the size of the box.

277
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
This is the opposite of the box.

278
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Please choose this one.

279
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
This is the third one.

280
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:14,000
This is the fourth one.

281
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Please choose this one.

282
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,000
This is the fifth one.

283
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
This is the sixth one.

284
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Please open it.

285
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:41,000
It's not easy for you to come this far.

286
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,000
You smell like a beast.

287
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Is it a sparrow?

288
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I'm a long-time rival of the sparrow.

289
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
A sparrow?

290
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I was attacked by a sparrow two years ago.

291
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:01,000
This old wound has healed.

292
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
He is a rival.

293
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I said something like this then.

294
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
The spirit of hell dwells in the corner of the old man's hair.

295
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:17,000
The golden color of the child's teeth is shining.

296
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Please go to the future.

297
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
This is a sparrow.

298
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,000
It's not easy for you to come this far.

299
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
It's annoying.

300
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
That's where it is.

301
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I know.

302
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
It's on the right.

303
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
It's really narrow.

304
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
That's right.

305
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
It's here.

306
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
It's narrow.

307
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
It's all the same.

308
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I can't see anything.

309
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I don't want to.

310
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I don't want to.

311
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I'm scared.

312
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Why are you here?

313
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Hide a little more.

314
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Let's go.

315
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I don't want to.

316
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I'm scared.

317
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Please go ahead.

318
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I don't want to.

319
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
You can go ahead.

320
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I don't want to.

321
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Please go ahead.

322
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I don't want to.

323
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Please go ahead.

324
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Go away.

325
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Go away.

326
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Go away.

327
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I don't want to.

328
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
You can't go.

329
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
I'm going home.

330
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Where are you going?

331
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
I don't want to.

332
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
It's the exit.

333
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
It's the exit.

334
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
It's dangerous.

335
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
What are you scared of?

336
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I'm scared.

337
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
It's not a ghost.

338
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
There are four.

339
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Come here.

340
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
There's a monitor.

341
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
There are 10.

342
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Congratulations, everyone.

343
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,000
You've got a gold piece.

344
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Then,

345
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,000
take four pieces and put them in the event hall.

346
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
When the event is over,

347
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,000
you can meet the new king of the century.

348
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I've seen this last time.

349
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
This is it.

350
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
What are you doing?

351
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
I don't know.

352
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
That's right.

353
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
That's it.

354
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
It's a piece of wood.

355
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
It's in.

356
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
It's a piece of wood.

357
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
It's a key.

358
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I can make it.

359
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
The key to the event hall.

360
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
It's open.

361
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:15,000
I can see it.

362
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
It's amazing.

363
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
It's amazing.

364
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
It's quite big.

365
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
It's fast.

366
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
World.

367
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
World.

368
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
World.

369
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
World.

370
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
World.

371
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
World.

372
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Thank you for waiting.

373
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Thank you for waiting.

374
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Now, let's welcome the six beauties

375
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
who are left for the final assessment.

376
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Now, let's welcome the six beauties

377
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
who are left for the final assessment.

378
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
