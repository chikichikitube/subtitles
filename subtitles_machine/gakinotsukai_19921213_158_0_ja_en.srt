1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,200
I'm Yoroshiku in the third time of the Gaki-no-tsukai Ara-hen

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,960
I'm a favorite entertainer

3
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:11,040
Are you so Chan-ka Grand Prix?

4
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:17,040
Good evening

5
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:18,920
Now everyone

6
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:21,960
It's already very popular

7
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,120
Are you so Chan-ka Grand Prix?

8
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:27,120
It's fun

9
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,400
Now

10
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,800
Guests and Matsumoto-san

11
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:38,000
Let's say the true name of the business

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,680
Now then, guests

13
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:41,680
Please

14
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:53,560
It is the usual member

15
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,280
Is it a book?

16
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:55,800
This is it

17
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:56,880
A book came out

18
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:57,800
Shift life

19
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:00,080
Is that so?

20
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,640
Well, thank you

21
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:04,200
Because there are guests today

22
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:07,000
Even if you put a beat here

23
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,480
These guys will speak

24
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:12,560
I think I can talk about it

25
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,040
There are too many mosaics

26
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,000
It's a mosaic

27
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,040
It takes a lot of time

28
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,320
I went in like that

29
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,800
It's okay now

30
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:28,200
I don't think it's good to put it out

31
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,000
The problem is here

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,400
Jaga-chan

33
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,280
If you look like you're out

34
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,320
Shingo-san family

35
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:44,360
Well, this problem is Shingo-san family

36
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:46,840
I have calculated

37
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:47,520
Let's introduce

38
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,720
I don't have to say it again

39
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,680
Why is it so wrong?

40
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,960
Well

41
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,120
Lega-in-chan or the captain

42
00:01:56,120 --> 00:02:00,120
Who will be chosen as the captain in these three people?

43
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,560
For the time being

44
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:07,240
12 women and students

45
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,440
Among them

46
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,560
5 seconds

47
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,680
The person who entered the lock is

48
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,600
Lega-in-chan or the captain

49
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,400
Please come on

50
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,160
I've done it once or twice so far

51
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,600
I can't get this once

52
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,880
I want to do it once

53
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,800
Is that so?

54
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,720
I haven't hit it once

55
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,640
I haven't hit it once

56
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,960
All of them are like this

57
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,200
Everyone is funny

58
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,800
That's the end

59
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,400
Let's go

60
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,040
First of all, Otake-san

61
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:34,760
Please

62
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,120
What did I say

63
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:36,760
Goroh

64
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,000
Nobichi Goroh

65
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,600
What is Yoko no Ewa?

66
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,400
Senbei-san

67
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,480
No matter what I do

68
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,000
Looking at this person's woman

69
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,760
After all it looks big

70
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,080
Hideki-san

71
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,400
After all young people are not against

72
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,440
I see

73
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,480
I see

74
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:56,920
Why are you talking to a dangerous person?

75
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,960
Because I don't know the name

76
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,880
That's right

77
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,680
An older sister of this age

78
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,880
It's okay

79
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:06,560
I had this kind of person in my head

80
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,760
Yes, Matsumoto-san

81
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,280
Well

82
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,480
Hideki

83
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,080
I see

84
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,640
I just know the name

85
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,120
What?

86
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:17,640
What do you mean?

87
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:18,640
I'm watching

88
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,480
Well

89
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:26,240
It's Komewareru

90
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,840
Are you already in?

91
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,120
You guys are also happy

92
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:31,880
If you say now

93
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,080
Say yes

94
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,400
Mr. Goroh Nobuchi

95
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:41,800
I see

96
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,040
Hideki Taijo

97
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,400
Hideki Taijo

98
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,840
Because it looks like a wild man

99
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,080
Go Hiromi

100
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,000
Mr. Goroh Nobuchi

101
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Taisho?

102
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Koohiro?

103
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Koohiro?

104
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Boro?

105
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Your face is ugly, so go to the bathroom.

106
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Okay.

107
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Well, then I'll go get rid of it.

108
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
And so, Taisho Hideki is the champion of the world championship!

109
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
It's the first time he's used it!

110
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
It's the first time he's used it!

111
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
You did it!

112
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
You did it.

113
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
This is nice.

114
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
The next question is this!

115
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
A female idol who seems to be eating Hanako!

116
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Who wrote this?

117
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Now, please write it on the flip.

118
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Go ahead!

119
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
It's obvious if you write it.

120
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Is there anyone who is obvious?

121
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I'm glad I wrote it.

122
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
What kind of person is it?

123
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Let's take a look.

124
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Mr. Ozaki!

125
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Go ahead!

126
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I wrote two people.

127
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Yamada-san!

128
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Yamada-san, Nami.

129
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Well, really.

130
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Well, this guy seems to be eating, too.

131
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
After that.

132
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
It's eating.

133
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
The vocal.

134
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Did you see him eat?

135
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Don't listen to me!

136
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I wrote Chiharu and Matsumoto Akko.

137
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I see.

138
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
The real name is Matsumoto Akko, right?

139
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Matsumoto Akko is an idol.

140
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
It's obvious that such a person ate it.

141
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Why is that?

142
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I'm not surprised if such a person ate it.

143
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I'll try to write it without the real name.

144
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Chiharu.

145
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Matsumoto Akko.

146
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Matsumoto Akko.

147
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Matsumoto-san!

148
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
That's difficult.

149
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Well, I'm...

150
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Can you eat Hanako?

151
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I don't know if I can eat it.

152
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
You're fine, too.

153
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
You can open a big office.

154
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Right?

155
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I'm sure I can open a big office.

156
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I'm sure I can.

157
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Miyuki Imori.

158
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Hiroko Moriguchi.

159
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Eriko Tamura.

160
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Shizuka Kudo.

161
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Hiroko Moriguchi.

162
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Shizuka Kudo.

163
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Hiroko Moriguchi.

164
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,000
If you don't watch TV, you'll probably lose.

165
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Eriko Tamura.

166
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I don't think it's a good idea to eat it.

167
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
From Nakajo.

168
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Shizuka Kudo.

169
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Eriko Tamura.

170
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Imori-san.

171
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Noriko Sakai.

172
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I want to eat it with a beer.

173
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Shizuka Kudo.

174
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Eriko Tamura.

175
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Shizuka Kudo.

176
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I'm eating it!

177
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
The first place is Shizuka Kudo!

178
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
The second place is Eriko Tamura.

179
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
There were a lot of them.

180
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Moriguchi.

181
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Imori.

182
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Moriguchi.

183
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Sakai.

184
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Noriko.

185
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Noriko.

186
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Don't shoot this.

187
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Why are you doing that?

188
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I can't use it like this!

189
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I can't use it like this!

190
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I'll put a mosaic here.

191
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I'll put a mosaic here.

192
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I don't know what's going on.

193
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Shut up.

194
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I'm talking about drinking.

195
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I'm talking about drinking.

196
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
In a week's time, everyone will be in Tokyo.

197
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
In a week's time, everyone will be in Tokyo.

198
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I'll put it in.

199
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I'll put it in.

200
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I'll put it in.

201
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I'll put it in.

202
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I'll put it in.

203
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Inahama-chan.

204
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Come over here.

205
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
You come over here, too.

206
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
It's fun.

207
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I'll sit here.

208
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
You also sit here.

209
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I'll do it properly.

210
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I'm sure it'll fly.

211
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
It's illegal.

212
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Osake-san.

213
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Enjoy!

214
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:04,080
I'm gonna eat a great

215
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
That's good.

216
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I'm sorry, sir.

217
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I'm going to eat Shreme-kun.

218
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
You've got changed your mind.

219
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
It's cute.

220
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
You're saying you went to the right person.

221
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I think that's the most common thing in the book.

222
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Why is the person who wrote it angry?

223
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I thought I followed you.

224
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I didn't go to the right person.

225
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I don't even know if this is a joke.

226
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I don't know.

227
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Golden Harp's Eva.

228
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
There aren't many people who remember this.

229
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Well, there aren't many people who remember this.

230
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I understand.

231
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Let's go!

232
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Let's go to the world!

233
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Please!

234
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Kimo-mi Daiki

235
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Matsuzaka Keiko

236
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Izumi Pinko

237
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Mori Mitsuko

238
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Hatsumi Dori

239
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I see.

240
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Hatsumi Dori

241
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
It doesn't seem to be that good.

242
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Izumi Pinko

243
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Koyanagi Rumi-po

244
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
It's a pretty Matsuzaka Keiko.

245
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Kote Gawa Yu

246
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Izumi Pinko

247
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Matsuzaka Keiko

248
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
It doesn't smell like something.

249
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
When I look at that man.

250
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Hatsumi Dori

251
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Rikako

252
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Kondo Misako-san, Tsugai Kinji-san, Ohagi-san, Matsudaira Keiko-san.

253
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
So, Bun-chan and the others are Matsudaira Keiko-san.

254
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Everyone, forget it.

255
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
It's not funny.

256
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Let's go to the last question.

257
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
The last question is...

258
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Here it is!

259
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
It's not funny.

260
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
It's not funny at all.

261
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:15,000
It's not funny at all.

262
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I saw it earlier.

263
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Nothing has changed.

264
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I've seen it twice.

265
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
It's not a big deal.

266
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
That's right. When you come out, you say,

267
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Wow!

268
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
It's not because you're popular.

269
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I just saw the people I saw on TV live.

270
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I just said that.

271
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
But that's it.

272
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,000
After all, there are times when you can see something you can't usually see by watching it live nearby.

273
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
What does that mean?

274
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
After all, I've been watching you all the time, so I know.

275
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,000
After all, when people watch TV, when they watch it live, they wonder if there's a mole in that place.

276
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I see.

277
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
That's what I found.

278
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Of course, why is Matsumoto so dumb?

279
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
That's what you're saying because you want to say that.

280
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I'm in trouble.

281
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Look at this.

282
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
There's a rock maker in it.

283
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
That's cool.

284
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
If you look closely, you can see it from the other side.

285
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
This is really.

286
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I can see it.

287
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
It's amazing.

288
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
There's a tree in it.

289
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
There's a tree in it.

290
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Well, that's one of the things.

291
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Don't say that.

292
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I might have said it before.

293
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Why are you stepping on your feet?

294
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Why are you stepping on your feet?

295
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I'm sorry.

296
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Just leave it alone.

297
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I don't know what that entertainer is.

298
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I wonder if it's a nuisance.

299
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Thank you.

300
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I didn't know at all.

301
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I thought it was a talent show.

302
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
It's quite a nuisance.

303
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
It's a nuisance that only entertainers have.

304
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:36,000
It's a nuisance that only entertainers have.

305
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I'm checking it myself, who is looking at me, I'm not a Zura guy.

306
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
This program is a talk show.

307
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I'm talking to my partner, but why am I here?

308
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Talk to me!

309
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
But I like you very much.

310
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I don't like you at all.

311
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I don't like you at all.

312
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Is this it?

313
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
It's coming.

314
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I think I should do it again.

315
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I don't want to do it again.

316
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I don't like you when you say it yourself.

317
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Well, well, well, well, well, well, well, well.

318
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Why?

319
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I don't like you.

320
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I don't like you.

321
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I met you before.

322
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
What?

323
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
We're moving, aren't we?

324
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:49,000
When I'm moving, I'm on the bullet train, and I'm next to someone.

325
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
There's something bad about that.

326
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Next to you?

327
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Next to me.

328
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
The man who was on my bullet train the other day.

329
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
He's talking to me.

330
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I know.

331
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
He's talking to me.

332
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
You're like a poop.

333
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
You're there sometimes, aren't you?

334
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
What are you eating?

335
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
You're really...

336
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I'm sorry, I'm going to poop in front of you.

337
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
There is.

338
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Why is that?

339
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I don't think I'm eating poop.

340
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
But it smells like poop.

341
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Where do you poop when you eat rice?

342
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Let's say you ate katsudon.

343
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
What?

344
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:46,000
It's still katsudon around here.

345
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000
It's still katsudon.

346
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
It's still katsudon.

347
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
It's still katsudon.

348
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
It's still katsudon.

349
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
It's still katsudon.

350
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
It's still katsudon.

351
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
In your case, I think it's a little different.

352
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
What's that?

353
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
The one with the poop.

354
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
The one with the poop.

355
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
So maybe it's fast.

356
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
What does that mean?

357
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
When you eat and go to the toilet, you're in a poop state.

358
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I'm in a poop state.

359
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Maybe.

360
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
That's why I'm talking, so I'm tired.

361
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I don't know if this is 100%.

362
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
But I'm going to eat it.

363
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
That's what you're saying 100%.

364
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Don't you know that?

365
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I don't know.

366
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
That's why you're in a poop state.

367
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I was told that.

368
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
What?

369
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
What do you mean?

370
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Why am I?

371
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Why am I?

372
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
That's weird.

373
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I'm serious.

374
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:50,000
If you say it to Matsumoto, it's the same.

375
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
There may be people who think so.

376
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
There's nothing smelly in my body.

377
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
What are you talking about?

378
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Well, maybe it's because I eat it.

379
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
You smell like squid every time.

380
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
That's because I eat squid.

381
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I don't know if that's the case.

382
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
When I'm talking, I'm in a good mood.

383
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I'm having a lot of fun.

384
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:18,000
If you smell like squid, I'll be late for the tsukkomi.

385
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,000
If you're going to say something like that, I'll have you say it.

386
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
What is it?

387
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
There are times when you smell like squid.

388
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
What do you smell like?

389
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,000
What is it?

390
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
It's me, isn't it?

391
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
That's a good joke.

392
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Matsumoto is also in a good mood today.

393
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I'm going to write that I'm in a good mood.

394
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I'm in a good mood.

395
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
What are you going to write?

396
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I'm still a little scared.

397
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I'm going to write this.

398
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
That's what I wrote.

399
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I think it'll be good for the opening.

400
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
What do you think when you see it?

401
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
White.

402
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
What?

403
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Why?

404
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
What do you think?

405
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Before you ask me why.

406
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I'll take the white one.

407
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Why?

408
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I said white.

409
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
No, I'm sorry. It's white.

410
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I'm telling you.

411
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
It's white.

412
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I'm the white one.

413
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
That's why I'm telling you.

414
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I'm telling you it's white.

415
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Wait a minute.

416
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Did you decide on this?

417
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Make sure you decide on that.

418
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I don't decide on rock-paper-scissors.

419
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
No, no, no, no.

420
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I'm telling you I don't decide on rock-paper-scissors.

421
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I want to play rock-paper-scissors.

422
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Why are you suddenly talking about rock-paper-scissors?

423
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
It's okay, so I'll do it.

424
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Rock-paper-scissors.

425
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
What is it?

426
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
What is it?

427
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I'm the white one.

428
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I'm the white one.

429
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I won the rock-paper-scissors.

430
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Don't say stupid things.

431
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I'll do it properly in the opening.

432
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I often see men with a split chin.

433
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:00,000
That split eye is useful.

434
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
It's there to hold up paper.

435
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Why do you hold it up?

436
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Why don't you hold it up?

437
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
You're doing this on purpose.

438
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:16,000
In Harari Man, you hold it up a little more.

439
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
But why don't you hold it up?

440
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
It's better if you stop!

441
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I often say that there is nothing inferior to the human body.

442
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Is that so?

443
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
That's why there must be some meaning in the fact that the chin is cracked.

444
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
There must be some meaning.

445
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
What do you mean?

446
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Do you have a meaning?

447
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
There is a meaning.

448
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
What's the meaning of this?

449
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
That's what I'm going to say.

450
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
If you ask why it's cracked like this, it's because it's easy to eat.

451
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
What?

452
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
It's cracked all at once.

453
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:57,000
If you ask why it's cracked, it's because it's easy to eat.

454
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,000
If you eat the contents of it, you're supposed to eat it when it's cracked.

455
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
It's easy to eat when it's empty anyway.

456
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
It is easy to eat when it's empty.

457
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
That's what I'm saying.

458
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
It's easy to eat when it's empty.

459
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
It's easy to eat when it's empty.

460
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
That's what I'm saying.

461
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:12,800
You're saying it!

462
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:13,400
I'm saying it!

463
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,400
No, no, so...

464
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,200
What's the point of this?

465
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,200
If it's open, it's easy to eat!

466
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:26,200
Yeah, if it's open, it's easy to eat!

467
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,800
If it's cracked, it's easy to open!

468
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,000
If it's cracked, it's easy to open!

469
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,200
If it's open, it's easy to eat!

470
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,800
If it's open, it's easy to eat!

471
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:34,700
That's why!

472
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:35,800
That's why!

473
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,500
Those who open and eat it are being ungrateful!

474
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:42,000
I'm not talking about eating it or not eating it!

475
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
If it's open, it's easy to eat!

476
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
That's strange!

477
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,500
That's strange!

478
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,000
Hey, you!

479
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,000
If you're angry, come here!

480
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
If it's open, it's easy to open!

481
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
I can't open it anymore!

482
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I'll tell you what you can really do!

483
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:06,000
It's better to hold it here!

484
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
It's better to hold it here!

485
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Ah! Not yet!

486
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
As a joke, I think it's okay!

487
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
No, master, really!

488
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Open it!

489
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Come on!

490
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Come on!

491
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
I'm trying to get something in there!

492
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Not yet!

493
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
If there are only those two!

494
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Open it here!

495
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
If it's open, it's easy to eat!

496
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
If it's open, it's easy to eat!

497
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Eh?

498
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Eh?

499
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Am I mistaken?

500
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Ah! If it's open, it's even more open than the mouth!

501
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
I think it means that you can put a lot of things in it!

502
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I'm addicted!

503
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
What are you talking about?

504
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
If there are ten eyes on the back!

505
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
It's easy to open!

506
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
No, wait a minute!

507
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
It's like this, isn't it?

508
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
It's open, isn't it?

509
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
What kind of state is this?

510
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,000
That's why it's all open here!

511
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Are you saying something like this?

512
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
What is it?

513
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
It's open, isn't it?

514
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
It's open, isn't it?

515
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Then it's easy to eat!

516
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
It's easy to eat, isn't it?

517
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
What's easy to eat?

518
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
The inside!

519
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
That's right!

520
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,000
That's why we've always thought that it's open and easy to eat things!

521
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
It's easy to open and eat!

522
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
What the hell!

523
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Are you pulling out the inside?

524
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
I'll tell you!

525
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
I don't eat!

526
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
I don't eat!

527
00:21:52,000 --> 00:22:02,000
It's easy to eat!
