1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Ladies and gentlemen.

2
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I'm sleepy.

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I thought I was going to sleep, but after 2-3 hours, my body is tired but my head is still awake.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
My grandma is still in my head.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
That's right.

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
My body is still awake but my head is still talking to my grandma.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I can't let go of my grandma's fantasy.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
But you have to talk on time.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Are you a teacher?

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Or are you just making up stories?

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
That's not true.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
We had a meeting about an hour before the show.

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
There aren't many grandmas who can do that much in an hour before the show.

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm not praising my grandma.

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
But I was so excited that I had a cold.

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
It's finally done.

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I haven't seen it yet.

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I just got an electric shock.

19
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
It's Hitoshi.

20
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Hitoshi and Oka.

21
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
My mother is here.

22
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
She's here again.

23
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
My eyes are burning.

24
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
What are you doing?

25
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I'm sorry.

26
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Why are you getting in my way?

27
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I'm listening to your song.

28
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Don't say that.

29
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
It's time to imitate.

30
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Don't say that.

31
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
It's hard for you to imitate.

32
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
It's easy.

33
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Really?

34
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Really?

35
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I can't do anything.

36
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Junko Sakurada.

37
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I'm Junko.

38
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I'm Junko.

39
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I'm Junko.

40
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I'm Junko.

41
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
You're all Junko.

42
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I'm sorry.

43
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Why are you apologizing?

44
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
What are you thinking?

45
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I can do it, mom.

46
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Number 18.

47
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Really?

48
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
What song are you going to sing?

49
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
It's Tokyo, mom.

50
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I'll sing it for you.

51
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I'll introduce it.

52
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Let's sing it together.

53
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Long time no see.

54
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
What do you mean long time no see?

55
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
You've been singing for a long time.

56
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
What are you talking about?

57
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I'm excited.

58
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
You're more excited than usual.

59
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I'm excited.

60
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
It's dangerous to attract people.

61
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
You're a kidnapper.

62
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I don't know.

63
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I'm a kidnapper.

64
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Take someone important to you.

65
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Take someone important to me?

66
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Yes.

67
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Take someone important to you and kill them.

68
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Kill them?

69
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
It's a bad attitude.

70
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Hello?

71
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
What's that?

72
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
It's a prank.

73
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
What are you talking about?

74
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Hello?

75
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Do you have a son?

76
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I have a 6th grader.

77
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
What's wrong with that?

78
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
It's embarrassing.

79
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
It's not funny.

80
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Hello?

81
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I have a 2nd grader.

82
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Take someone important to you.

83
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Take someone important to me?

84
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
A 2nd grader?

85
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
What are you going to do?

86
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
It's a prank.

87
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Take someone important to you and kill them.

88
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I'm tired and excited.

89
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I'm tired and excited.

90
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
He's waiting for you.

91
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
He's looking at your face.

92
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I'm getting old.

93
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
You're still walking.

94
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I've been doing this for 3 years.

95
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Thank you.

96
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Is my partner here?

97
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Your partner?

98
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
He's on his way here.

99
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Thank you.

100
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Good morning.

101
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Good morning.

102
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Thank you.

103
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Hello.

104
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I can't help it.

105
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I can't help it.

106
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
It's amazing.

107
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I've been doing this for 3 years.

108
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I can't help it.

109
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I don't like it.

110
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Here you are.

111
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Thank you.

112
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
If you don't remember that,

113
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I'll ask the god to give you a picture.

114
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I can't show you.

115
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I don't want to wear it.

116
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I don't want to do it.

117
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I don't want to do it either.

118
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I don't want to do it either.

119
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Look, look.

120
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I can't do it.

121
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
It's a little hard.

122
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I'm going home.

123
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
When I called you,

124
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
You said,

125
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I'm going to open a temple.

126
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I'm going to burn it.

127
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I should have said that.

128
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
And...

129
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I don't know if you can really imitate it.

130
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I don't think so.

131
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I will do it.

132
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Long time no see.

133
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Please hold my hand.

134
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Please hold my hand.

135
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I wonder if it's okay.

136
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
If it's the real thing, I'll fly around.

137
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
It's a place where people pull.

138
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I'm scared.

139
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I can't help it because I'm told to pull my hand over there.

140
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
What if I pull my hand?

141
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
What if I pull my hand?

142
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
What if I run away?

143
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
What a good hole.

144
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I see.

145
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
What if I say?

146
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
That would be the worst.

147
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I'm scared.

148
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I'm scared.

149
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I don't want to.

150
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Why don't you do it?

151
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I don't want to.

152
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I'm annoyed now, but I'll write it down when I watch the movie later.

153
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I don't want to.

154
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I don't want to.

155
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I'm scared.

156
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I don't want to.

157
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I don't want to.

158
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I don't want to.

159
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Hello.

160
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
It's me.

161
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
What?

162
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Did you sleep?

163
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Listen to my mother's cry.

164
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Grandma.

165
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Grandma.

166
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Grandma.

167
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Grandma.

168
00:09:38,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Grandma.

169
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Grandma.

170
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
30 seconds left.

171
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
30 seconds left.

172
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
25 seconds left.

173
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I'm nervous.

174
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
5 seconds left.

175
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
4, 3, 2, 1.

176
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
3, 2, 1.

177
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Time's up.

178
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
It's Hitoshi.

179
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
It's Okan.

180
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Hitoshi and Okan together.

181
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Okan.

182
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
My mother died.

183
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
My mother died.

184
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
She died today.

185
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
She died today.

186
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
She died today.

187
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
She died today.

188
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
What are you doing?

189
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
You're disturbing my mother.

190
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
You're disturbing my mother.

191
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
It's been a while.

192
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Hitoshi.

193
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Hitoshi.

194
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
It's been a while.

195
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Hitoshi.

196
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
What is this?

197
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Do you want to play?

198
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
What?

199
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Bring me the prize.

200
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Bring it?

201
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
What are you going to do with it?

202
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
What are you going to do with it?

203
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Thank you very much.

204
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
It's been a long time.

205
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Really?

206
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
It's nothing.

207
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
It's nothing.

208
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Let's do our best next year.

209
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Next year, let's go with a doctor's story.

210
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Next year, let's go with a doctor's story.

211
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
What are you talking about?

212
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Thank you very much.

213
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
It's over.

214
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I'll call you again.

215
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I'll call you again.

216
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I'll call you again.

217
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Bye-bye.

218
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Bye-bye.

219
00:12:44,000 --> 00:13:02,000
It was scary.

220
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Hitoshi, you're doing well.

221
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I always watch you on TV.

222
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
It's been a while.

223
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Take care of yourself and keep up the good work.

224
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Thank you very much.

225
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Thank you for having fun.

226
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Take care of yourself and keep up the good work.

227
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Take care of yourself and keep up the good work.

228
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Hitoshi, let's meet again soon.

229
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Hitoshi, let's meet again soon.

230
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Let's do a comic book with your mother.

231
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Let's do our best.

232
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
That's all.

233
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Thank you very much.

234
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
That woman is too excited.

235
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
That woman is too excited.

236
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
She's not excited at all.

237
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
But I know you're excited.

238
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
But I know you're excited.

239
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
One of them is pretty good, but the other one is crazy.

240
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
One of them is pretty good, but the other one is crazy.

241
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Gyo-san's fans came.

242
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I was taking a picture from the window.

243
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I was taking a picture from the window.

244
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Please don't turn on the flash.

245
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
The fans outside...

246
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I'm holding back.

247
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I'm holding back.

248
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Who is it?

249
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
It's Joichi.

250
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I don't know.

251
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
There was an old lady with glasses on.

252
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
There was an old lady with glasses on.

253
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I don't know her.

254
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Wait a minute.

255
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I don't know her, but she's in the Matsumoto family.

256
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Did you bring her?

257
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Hitoshi, long time no see.

258
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I'm saying, oh, my God.

259
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Who is it?

260
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Who is it?

261
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I'm saying, hello.

262
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I didn't ask you until the end.

263
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I asked, she's my dad's brother's wife's sister.

264
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I asked, she's my dad's brother's wife's sister.

265
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I asked, she's my dad's brother's wife's sister.

266
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
That's a little hard.

267
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I don't know her.

268
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I'm saying, please show me the mother.

269
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
That's hard.

270
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
No matter what you say.

271
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
No matter what you say.

272
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Who's that?

273
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Who's the old lady with glasses on?

274
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I've never seen her.

275
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I don't know.

276
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
She's my brother's sister-in-law.

277
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
She was looking over here.

278
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
She was worried.

279
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
She was afraid.

280
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
She thought I was gone.

281
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
She was looking over here.

282
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
You can't have a family.

283
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Ah!

284
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Congratulations!

285
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Congratulations to the second child.

286
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
You're doing quite well.

287
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I thought you were only doing it outside, not at home.

288
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Only doing it outside?

289
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Say something!

290
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
You're doing quite well at home.

291
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Why?

292
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I'm doing it to make tea.

293
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I'm not doing it to save money.

294
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I'm doing it to make tea.

295
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Amazing.

296
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
The Hamada family is slowly being made.

297
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Of course.

298
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
The Hamada family is young.

299
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
The Hamada family is much older than our family.

300
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I was surprised.

301
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
When I saw the news, I was surprised.

302
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Were you reading the news?

303
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
No, I wasn't.

304
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
On Sunday...

305
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
You're just a student.

306
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Who's saying, well...

307
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
On Sunday...

308
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I wasn't saying, well...

309
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
On Sunday...

310
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
You were going to work on Sunday, right?

311
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
You were going to work on Sunday, right?

312
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
You were going to work on Sunday, right?

313
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I was already quite late.

314
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I was already quite late.

315
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
But I don't know.

316
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
The kids are all over the place.

317
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
You're really...

318
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
You're really no good.

319
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I think...

320
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I think this is the only story.

321
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
No seeds?

322
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I think it's probably no seeds.

323
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Around the 21st,

324
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I had a fever of about 44 degrees.

325
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Really?

326
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I can't believe it.

327
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I had a fever of about 44 degrees.

328
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
My fingers were melting.

329
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
You're lying.

330
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
It's true, it's true.

331
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
It hurts when it burns.

332
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
At that time,

333
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
when I had a fever of over 40 degrees,

334
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I was like,

335
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
will I have no seeds,

336
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
or will I be a fool?

337
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I was like,

338
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I'm having fun!

339
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I'm having fun!

340
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
No, no, that's not it.

341
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
I was like that even before I had a fever.

342
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
If it was that bad.

343
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
They said I was a slave.

344
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
But I wasn't a fool.

345
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,000
There was a lot of computer graphics.

346
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
That was a fool.

347
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
If nothing happened,

348
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I think it's probably true.

349
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
But I don't think I can be a child.

350
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I'm not a character who can be a child.

351
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
I'm scared.

352
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
If I go somewhere in a wheelchair.

353
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
If you do something like this.

354
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I'm scared.

355
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
But I hate you.

356
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I hate you.

357
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
At that time,

358
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I was like,

359
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
they're not cute.

360
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I think everyone should live more honestly.

361
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
This girl is cute.

362
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Men are cute,

363
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
but women are cute.

364
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Most of them are lies.

365
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Even though they hate it.

366
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Women can't be cute without children.

367
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
They're determined.

368
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
That's you.

369
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
No, no,

370
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
in my heart,

371
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
even though I don't like it,

372
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I love children.

373
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
That's what women say.

374
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
They think I'm a terrible woman.

375
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
To be honest, I wish I could live a simple life.

376
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
When I go out to eat and talk about poop,

377
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
they say,

378
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I don't feel like eating.

379
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
That's ridiculous.

380
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
That's definitely a lie.

381
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Well, that's a lie.

382
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I don't eat while pooping here.

383
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I can't eat it.

384
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I poop around the glass and drink wine.

385
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Why doesn't it hurt when you pinch your elbow?

386
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
That's right.

387
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
It hurts when you pinch it.

388
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
No, it doesn't hurt at all.

389
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
No, it doesn't hurt at all like this.

390
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
But it hurts like this, doesn't it?

391
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
No, it doesn't hurt at all.

392
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Hang in there.

393
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,000
No, it doesn't hurt at all like this.

394
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
It hurts when you pinch it.

395
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Why doesn't it hurt when you pinch your elbow?

396
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
No, it doesn't hurt at all like this.

397
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
There's a jujube in it.

398
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Yes, yes, yes.

399
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Isn't there something like that?

400
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
No, no.

401
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:22,000
No, it doesn't hurt at all like this.

402
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Right?

403
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
That's right.

404
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
That's right.

405
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
That's right.

406
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
That's right.

407
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
That's what I usually want to see.

408
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
I have a cell phone.

409
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Well, most people have a pocket bell these days.

410
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:40,000
For example, whose cell phone is that?

411
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Oh, it's mine, right?

412
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Oh, your cell phone is ringing.

413
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
But that's a mistake.

414
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,000
I have a cell phone, but it's not my cell phone.

415
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
The cell phone is borrowed.

416
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
It's a rental.

417
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:01,000
I have it, so it's my cell phone, but it's not my cell phone.

418
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:10,000
The elbow is like that, too.

419
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Whose is it?

420
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:18,000
The elbow on my body.

421
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Whose is it?

422
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:28,000
If you look for it, you'll be too sad.

423
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I'm looking for my parents.

424
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
I'm looking for my parents.

425
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:39,000
I know how you feel about looking for the owner of your elbow.

426
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
That's what you say.

427
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
But if you go there, it might be a problem for the other party.

428
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:54,000
There's a family there.

429
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Do you know?

430
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Do you know?

431
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Do you know?

432
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
You're bleeding.

433
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
This one hurts!

434
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
There's no way it'll come out

435
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
What did you sleep on?

436
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:35,000
What did you sleep on?
