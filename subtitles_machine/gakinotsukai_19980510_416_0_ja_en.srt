1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
This program is brought to you by the following sponsors.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I'm looking forward to it.

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Like this?

4
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I went to see it.

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
What did you see?

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I went to see David Copperfield.

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The one with magic?

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Yes, the one with magic.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
It was amazing.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
It was amazing.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I don't know how much I can say about this.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Anyway, what I can say is...

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
It was gone.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
It was gone.

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
That's his business.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
It suddenly came out of nowhere.

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
It disappeared again.

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
It came out again.

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
It disappeared again.

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
A busy man.

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
A busy man.

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
David said,

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The husband has disappeared again.

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
But I saw some seeds.

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I saw the seeds.

26
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
That's what I think.

27
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Which one?

28
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
You didn't see it, did you?

29
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
It's your idea to talk now, isn't it?

30
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I didn't see it.

31
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
What do you mean?

32
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I don't know why it disappeared.

33
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I don't know either.

34
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
But when it disappeared,

35
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
It appeared in the middle of the audience.

36
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
It disappeared immediately.

37
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
This is amazing.

38
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
This is amazing.

39
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I saw it.

40
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Why?

41
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
He is a twin.

42
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
There is no mistake.

43
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
This is not a place to laugh.

44
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
This is not a place to laugh.

45
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
This is not a place to laugh.

46
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
They are twins.

47
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
There is no mistake.

48
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
You understood me immediately, didn't you?

49
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
What?

50
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Are you a fool?

51
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
No.

52
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
It came out immediately.

53
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
On the contrary,

54
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I want to say it's amazing.

55
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
They say,

56
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
You shouldn't do it.

57
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
They say,

58
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
You should do it because it's amazing.

59
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
But I found out that they are twins.

60
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
If I have a little more time,

61
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I think there is a trick.

62
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I can't believe it.

63
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
If I pull the cloth,

64
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
It will fall.

65
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
It's definitely David Tepperfield.

66
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
What does that mean?

67
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
It's my brother.

68
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Your brother is Tepperfield?

69
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Tepperfield.

70
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
This is the name I gave him.

71
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
It's not Sadako.

72
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
And he is jumping.

73
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
He is jumping.

74
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
That's what they do on the piano, right?

75
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I think that's the first thing.

76
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Because there is no way.

77
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I went to Yamazaki with him.

78
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
He is a fool.

79
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I thought he was joking at first.

80
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I understood.

81
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
What is going on with the twins.

82
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
What do you think he said?

83
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
It's a magnet.

84
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Where are you trying to go?

85
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
He is crazy.

86
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
A magnet is just right.

87
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
If it's a magnet that lifts a human,

88
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Tepperfield goes up to the ceiling.

89
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Tepperfield is under the iron.

90
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
There is a big magnet on the ceiling.

91
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Tepperfield goes up to the ceiling.

92
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:41,000
And everyone turns off the lights.

93
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Tepperfield goes up to the ceiling.

94
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
He is sweating.

95
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I'm not sweating.

96
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
He is helping.

97
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
His bag and wallet are flying.

98
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
That's right.

99
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
The cover under the microphone is also flying.

100
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
That's bad.

101
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
When I came here before,

102
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
He didn't clean the building.

103
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Did he come here before?

104
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
He didn't come here before.

105
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
He was the goddess of freedom, right?

106
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
He cleaned the building, right?

107
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Who are you?

108
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
He came here today.

109
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I don't know you.

110
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I don't know you.

111
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
He is wearing a suit.

112
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Is that so?

113
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Did he come here before?

114
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
He didn't come here before.

115
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Is that true?

116
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
He was surprised.

117
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
That's not true.

118
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Everyone knows that he is amazing.

119
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I don't know how much to say.

120
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
He was a cherry blossom.

121
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Everyone else was a cherry blossom.

122
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Everyone else was a cherry blossom.

123
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I don't know how much to say.

124
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
The timing was too good.

125
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
After the show,

126
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
It was a standing ovation.

127
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Everyone was standing up.

128
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I was standing up.

129
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I was standing up.

130
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I thought it was wrong.

131
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
But I was surprised at one thing.

132
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Really?

133
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
At first, I was given a piece of paper.

134
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I was told to cut it.

135
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I cut it into eight pieces of paper.

136
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
It became a card.

137
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I see.

138
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Only one of them was a picture of the moon.

139
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
The rest was white.

140
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Everyone told me to put it out.

141
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I told them to put it in the shape they wanted.

142
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I told them to put it in the shape they wanted.

143
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I told them to put it in the shape they wanted.

144
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I told them to put it in the shape they wanted.

145
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I was waiting for the right shot.

146
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Telling everyone what he said.

147
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I told them to look at the top.

148
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
That was wrong.

149
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Same with the second one.

150
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
And the third one.

151
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
This is the picture of the moon.

152
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I was surprised.

153
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
3,000 people were surprised.

154
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
You were fooled, too.

155
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Everyone was surprised.

156
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
You were surprised, too.

157
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
No no no no.

158
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Not everyone was like that.

159
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Oh, really?

160
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Yamazaki wasn't like that.

161
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Yamazaki was like, what?

162
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
You should've waited for me somewhere.

163
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Really?

164
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Because I'm an idiot.

165
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I didn't even get hit, but Kappa failed.

166
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
What are you talking about?

167
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I wanted you to hit me.

168
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
He kept coming down.

169
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Like, who should I hit?

170
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I think it was obvious.

171
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
He was in love.

172
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
There was a magic ring.

173
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Fujiwara was there too.

174
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Fujiwara gave me a pair of glasses.

175
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I looked at it, and he was like, no.

176
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I didn't understand why.

177
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I thought he was waiting for me.

178
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I was like, where is he?

179
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Really?

180
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Fujiwara was like, no.

181
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I looked at him, and he was like, no.

182
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I think it was obvious.

183
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
He was really angry.

184
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I've never seen a Kappa fail face like that.

185
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I've never seen a normal face.

186
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I was surprised by the card thing.

187
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
But he wasn't next to you, was he?

188
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
He was definitely doing something weird.

189
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I think he was excited.

190
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
At the end, he shook his hand like this.

191
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
To Yamazaki's Kappa field.

192
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
He went out like this.

193
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
He wanted you to take him home.

194
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
It was really amazing.

195
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
He came out like this.

196
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
It wasn't very interesting.

197
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Is there anyone?

198
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
If you don't know, don't tell anyone.

199
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I don't know how he disappeared.

200
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I want you to tell me before he died.

201
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
He cut his stomach with a razor.

202
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
It wasn't a real razor.

203
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
He cut the membrane like this.

204
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
It was cut off.

205
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
It was moving like this.

206
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
What do you think happened?

207
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
He was beaten.

208
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
You're addicted to him.

209
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I'm not addicted to him.

210
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I'm just a little addicted.

211
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
That's enough.

212
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Yesterday,

213
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I went to see him.

214
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
There were a lot of people.

215
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
There was a guy who asked me to take a picture with him.

216
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Yesterday,

217
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Everyone wanted to go to the bathroom.

218
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Everyone wanted to go to the bathroom.

219
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
So I went to the bathroom.

220
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
It's far from the bathroom.

221
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
He was holding the camera all the time.

222
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
He asked me to take a picture with him.

223
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I told him I was watching him.

224
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
He never let me take a picture with him.

225
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Do you know why?

226
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
If you don't know, don't tell anyone.

227
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I'll tell you.

228
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
If you're a real fan of me,

229
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:26,000
You should ask for a handshake rather than a picture.

230
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I don't know.

231
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
It's okay.

232
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
If you really like me,

233
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
You should want to touch me first.

234
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Right?

235
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
First of all,

236
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I want to touch your body.

237
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
That's fan psychology.

238
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
And then,

239
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
The next is a picture.

240
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
You don't have to be a fan to take a picture of me.

241
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
You don't have to be a fan to take a picture of me.

242
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I just want to show you.

243
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I don't know.

244
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
What are you doing?

245
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I'm so scared right now.

246
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I'm so scared right now.

247
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I'm so scared right now.

248
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I'm so scared right now.

249
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
You're acting like a woman.

250
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
How can you say such a stupid thing?

251
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
This is an insult.

252
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
It's true.

253
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Please take a picture of me.

254
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I hate it.

255
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Well, well, well.

256
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Right?

257
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
What is it?

258
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
He is insensitive.

259
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:46,000
The tuna is your partner, right?

260
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Come on.

261
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Come on.

262
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Well, well, well.

263
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I heard that something terrible has happened.

264
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
What is it?

265
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Mr. Matsumoto, please tell me.

266
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
This is...

267
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
What is it?

268
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Well, well, well.

269
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Well, well, well.

270
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:18,000
When the audience heard it, they were surprised.

271
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
What happened?

272
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Well, well, well.

273
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Everyone panicked.

274
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I don't care.

275
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Why are you panicking?

276
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
What's wrong with you?

277
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
The audience, the cameraman, and Suga-chan are all here.

278
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Suga-chan is here, too.

279
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Only Irie-chan is left.

280
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Why?

281
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Everyone is here.

282
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Everyone is here.

283
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I want to protect you.

284
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I want to protect you.

285
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
What's going on?

286
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Well, well, well.

287
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
It's my butt.

288
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
My anus.

289
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Everyone ran away.

290
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
What's wrong with your butt?

291
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Well, well, well.

292
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I don't know such details.

293
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
You were wondering what happened to Matsumoto's butt, right?

294
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
But when I asked what was going on, everyone was surprised.

295
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I don't like it.

296
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I'm embarrassed, too.

297
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I won't tell you.

298
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Tell me.

299
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Tell me what's going on with your butt.

300
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Well, well, well.

301
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I'm not in the mood today.

302
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Well, well, well.

303
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Well, well, well.

304
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I'll be the bad guy.

305
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
You can't be the bad guy.

306
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Your butt is weird.

307
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
What's wrong with you?

308
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Why do you want me?

309
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Tell me.

310
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
What's going on with your anus?

311
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Well, well, well.

312
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I don't know what you're doing.

313
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I don't know what you're doing.

314
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
You can see the atmosphere of this audience.

315
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I'm jealous of you saying that.

316
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
You're a fool.

317
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I know that.

318
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
You were shaking your butt a lot.

319
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
That's right.

320
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I'll tell you why I shook my butt.

321
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I shook my butt many times.

322
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I was thinking what to say while shaking my butt.

323
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
You shouldn't say that.

324
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I know that.

325
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I know that.

326
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
If you say that, I'll...

327
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
It's okay.

328
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
You can ask me anything today.

329
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Well, well, well.

330
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
It's okay.

331
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Well, well, well.

332
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Tell me.

333
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Tell me what's going on with your butt.

334
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
My butt is...

335
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
It's a star shape.

336
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
It's half and half.

337
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
It's your fault.

338
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
It's your fault.

339
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Why did you shake your butt?

340
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Why did I shake my butt?

341
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Wait a minute.

342
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I don't know what you're doing.

343
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I don't know what you're doing.

344
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
You were shaking your butt so much.

345
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I thought you were holding something.

346
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
That's right.

347
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:20,000
That's right.

348
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
What's wrong with you?

349
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I was scared when I saw you.

350
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I don't know what you're doing.

351
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I thought you were holding something.

352
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
It's your fault.

353
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Next.

354
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Next.

355
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
This hand is next.

356
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
How many times have you done this?

357
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I'm a professional.

358
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I've been doing this for 17 years.

359
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I've been doing this for 17 years.

360
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
It's not here.

361
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
It's here.

362
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
The man with the sweetest voice in the entertainment world.

363
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Thank you very much.

364
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Just talking on the phone.

365
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
The other woman.

366
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I want to be hugged by this person once.

367
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Please tell me how to talk.

368
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I see.

369
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
When a man is trying to impress a woman,

370
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
He wants to have fun with conversation.

371
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
He wants to compliment the other woman.

372
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
But this is a big mistake.

373
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
It doesn't matter what you say.

374
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Is that so?

375
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
It's a woman's bio-rhythm.

376
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
There's a woman's...

377
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
There's a woman's...

378
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
There's a woman's...

379
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
There's a woman's...

380
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
There's a woman's...

381
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
There's a woman's...

382
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
There's a woman's...

383
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
When the woman drops a little,

384
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
When the woman drops a little,

385
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
It's the time when the woman is at ease.

386
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
It's the time when the woman is at ease.

387
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I see.

388
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I have a way of doing it.

389
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I know that.

390
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
No, I don't need that.

391
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Please tell me how to do it.

392
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
How to do it.

393
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
You're gonna stick it on, right?

394
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I'll touch it a little bit.

395
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I'll touch it a little bit.

396
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Touch what?

397
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Please tell me how to do it.

398
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
How should I say it?

399
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Can you do a female role?

400
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I'm the only one who can do it.

401
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
You've been doing only female roles recently.

402
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
You're a bastard!

403
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
What do you want me to do?

404
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Women have weak ears.

405
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Women who don't think much even if they're attacked by their ears.

406
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Even Kimusume can do it.

407
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
That's just a word.

408
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
It's like blowing a breath into your ear.

409
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
In a conversation,

410
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
when a person wants to do it,

411
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Do you understand?

412
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Yes.

413
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Hello?

414
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Hello?

415
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
What were you doing?

416
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I was watching TV.

417
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
What TV were you watching?

418
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
What TV were you watching?

419
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I was watching a news program.

420
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
What kind of news program is it?

421
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
The one that Kume-san is talking about.

422
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Like this?

423
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Your face is funny.

424
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
If you do that in front of me,

425
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
it's not a face.

426
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,000
It's not a face. What are you talking about?

427
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
What is this?

428
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Don't say that.

429
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I thought you were tricked.

430
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I said, try it.

431
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
You said, try it.

432
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
So you went home and told your wife to try it.

433
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I had a hard time today.

434
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
If you do that,

435
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I'll give you another bowl of rice.

436
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Don't you think it's okay to be hugged like that?

437
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I think it's okay.

438
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Women have weak ears.

439
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
If you do that in front of me,

440
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I'll understand.

441
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
But if you do that in front of me,

442
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
women are scary creatures.

443
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Right? I remember that.

444
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:28,000
But you've never been hugged directly.

445
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I just got it.

446
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I got it the day before yesterday.

447
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
What is that?

448
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
It's the same sex.

449
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I get it.

450
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:43,000
There are a lot of women here today.

451
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I don't think I can laugh.

452
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Really?

453
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I'm serious.

454
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
But you're laughing a lot.

455
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I'm laughing, but I'm laughing in my upper mouth.

456
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
You're stupid.

457
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Right?

458
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
You're crazy.

459
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
In my lower mouth,

460
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
You're a old man.

461
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Excuse me.

462
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Yes.

463
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
May I?

464
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,000
You seem to have a lot of confidence in golf.

465
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I don't have confidence.

466
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:28,000
My staff told me a while ago.

467
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Yamazaki, me, and Kogoriko.

468
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Four of us.

469
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Can you do it alone and win?

470
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
He said he could win.

471
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Me?

472
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Yes.

473
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I didn't say that.

474
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Are you done talking?

475
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Let's say you hit one.

476
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,000
I'll hit four.

477
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
You hit four.

478
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
What do you call that?

479
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
It's a cup in.

480
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
It's a cup in.

481
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,000
How many times did I hit it?

482
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I hit it 16 times and got the same score.

483
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Yes.

484
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
It was a par-4.

485
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Yes.

486
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I said, can you do it?

487
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,000
You said, it's easy.

488
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
I got the information.

489
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I didn't say that.

490
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,000
But you can win, right?

491
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Which one?

492
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
You can win, but...

493
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
You guys...

494
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
I can't...

495
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
I can't lose to this guy.

496
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
That's true.

497
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
That's true, but...

498
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
It's okay, right?

499
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
It's okay.

500
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Really?

501
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
I'll do it.

502
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
What?

503
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
A match.

504
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
A match?

505
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
A match.

506
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Why a match?

507
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
It's four against one.

508
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
If you lose, you'll die.

509
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
What?

510
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,000
If you lose, the four of us will hold a knife and...

511
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
If you're still like that, I can run away, too.

512
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
If you grab it like this, I'll grab it.

513
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I'll prepare a punishment like that.

514
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
What if you guys lose?

515
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,000
If the four of us lose, the four of us will do something.

516
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Let's do that.

517
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
It's okay.

518
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,000
I'm glad you came to this match.

519
00:21:46,000 --> 00:22:03,000
On the other hand, you're being made a fool of.

520
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
In order to tell the history of the instrument user,

521
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,000
a match that can never be written and a punishment game.

522
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Sometimes it's a shame.

523
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Sometimes it's a life-threatening skydiving.

524
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
A serious match where you throw away your pride and put your body on the line.

525
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:24,000
I'm sure many of you have even learned how to be moved.

526
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Various challenges with courage.

527
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,000
There were so many early plannings that no one thought they would do.

528
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
And in the history of such a confrontation and punishment game,

529
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:40,000
I'm trying to write a new page.

530
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Matsumoto, Yamazaki, and Kokoriko, who challenge Hamada, the master of golf.

531
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Can we get emotional again in this confrontation?

532
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
I'm pretty moved.

533
00:22:53,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Please look forward to it.

534
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:26,000
I'll give you a gift.

535
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Yamazaki-kun.

536
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
I've never seen him before.

537
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,000
I'm going to write a new page in Hamada.

538
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
I want to drink while I'm at it.

539
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Let's go.

540
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Ha!

541
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:46,000
I've been living my life to the fullest.

542
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:51,000
I'll do my best.

543
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Thank you for your hard work every day.

544
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Da!

545
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
My favorite person more than anyone else!

546
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Are you going to continue?

547
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Ma!
