00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,000
The number of accidents that have occurred in the past 5 years has completely risen, and it is actually a fraction of 1 in 49 seconds.

2
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
The number of accidents that have occurred in the past 5 years has completely risen, and it is actually a fraction of 1 in 49 seconds.

3
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
They are having fun driving on the table, but they are always next to each other.

4
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
The number of accidents that have occurred in the past 5 years has completely risen, and it is actually a fraction of 1 in 49 seconds.

5
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Hello?

6
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
A middle-aged man's car and a car in the intersection meet at the crossroad.

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
The traffic accident caused by the mobile phone while driving.

8
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The car in the intersection was hit by a car in the intersection.

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:10,000
A few years ago, I was told not to use my mobile phone while driving.

10
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I thought it was stupid to use my mobile phone while driving.

11
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
But it was my own idea.

12
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
An accident in the middle of the intersection.

13
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The car in the intersection was hit by a car in the intersection.

14
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I thought it was stupid to use my mobile phone while driving.

15
00:01:36,000 --> 00:02:03,000
The car in the intersection was hit by a car in the intersection.

16
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
The car in the intersection was hit by a car in the intersection.

17
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
It was very cold that day.

18
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
The driver wanted to warm up his body, so he drove the car to the corn soup in the neighborhood.

19
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
But the distance between the neighborhood and the corn soup was a dead end.

20
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
The car was blown away by the impact of the accident.

21
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
The car was blown away by the impact of the accident.

22
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
The car was blown away by the impact of the accident.

23
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Sometimes the car was blown away by the impact of the accident.

24
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
The car in the intersection was hit by a car in the intersection.

25
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
The car in the intersection was hit by a car in the intersection.

26
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
The driver was exhausted because of the work he had to do the day before.

27
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
As a result, his mouth looked red.

28
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
On that day, the driver was blind.

29
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Before the accident, I made a mistake by looking at the green light and parsley.

30
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I should have stopped the car and taken a nap.

31
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I've been thinking about it for a long time.

32
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
But I couldn't do it.

33
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
He made a mistake by looking at the green light and parsley.

34
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
It was a sudden accident because he stepped on the brakes unexpectedly.

35
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
It was a sudden accident because he stepped on the brakes unexpectedly.

36
00:03:44,000 --> 00:04:13,000
The car was blown away by the impact of the accident.

37
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
The driver was blind because of the sea milk.

38
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
The car was blown away by the impact of the accident.

39
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,000
The driver was blind because of the sea milk.

40
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
The driver was back home, but he was already late.

41
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
The sea milk was very shiny.

42
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
The sea milk was very shiny.

43
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:44,000
The sea milk reflected in the light and jumped into my eyes.

44
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I thought it was a delicious oyster.

45
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I was taken away by the sea milk.

46
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
The sea milk didn't hit the oyster, but the car.

47
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:25,000
The sea milk didn't hit the oyster, but the car.

48
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
The hungry young driver.

49
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
His hunger reached its peak.

50
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
At that time.

51
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
It's a set of young steaks and young birds.

52
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
He was distracted by the waitress who jumped in.

53
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
He was distracted by the waitress who jumped in.

54
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:46,000
It was time for the old steering wheel to avoid the collision with the shellfish.

55
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
It was a tragedy due to the youth of young steaks and young birds.

56
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,000
The weight of the steaks was weighed, but the weight of life was not weighed.

57
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
anger

58
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
The scientific story of the freakin' car, I looked up, and it was inounced as a truck with a cart in copy.

59
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
The scientific story of the freakin' car, I looked up, and it was inounced as a truck with a cart in copy.

60
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Yeah.

61
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Yeah.

62
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
It's a overcome, but it's probably gonna to happen.

63
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,100
The driver

64
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:44,200
She kept an eye on the wine at the table.

65
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:48,000
It was a sad story about eating the whole bottle of wine.

66
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,000
The wine was sweet, but Chico ended up with a bitter taste.

67
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:05,000
At this time of the year when there are many events such as the New Year's party, sleep driving is the most common.

68
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:11,000
The driver was attacked by a water horse at the end of the year when he was tired of working over and over again.

69
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,000
It was a big accident that a moment of sleep became a life-and-death experience.

70
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Only for a moment...

71
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I don't usually sleep well.

72
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I don't usually sleep well.

73
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I don't sleep well.

74
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I don't sleep well at all.

75
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
When I get sleepy, I wake up with gum or candy.

76
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
But at that time, I was just tired.

77
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I'm sorry.

78
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Because of this accident, he got into a fight with another car.

79
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
And he crashed into a coffee cup at the end of the drug.

80
00:07:53,000 --> 00:08:01,000
There are many other coffee cups, but there is no life in them.

81
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
In addition, this accident also happened.

82
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
This is the corner where sponge cake and glass line up.

83
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
One young man had an accident on this day as well.

84
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Yes, I did speed up.

85
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
The speedometer needle was at a low speed.

86
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
But it was faster than I thought.

87
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
But it was really fast.

88
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
It was really fast.

89
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
It was really fast.

90
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
It was faster than I thought.

91
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I'm glad I was saved by the sponge cake.

92
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I don't want to see anything.

93
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Fortunately, the sponge cake didn't have a cushion.

94
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
The driver was saved.

95
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
He was distracted by the speedometer.

96
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
He was distracted by the speedometer.

97
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
He was distracted by the speedometer.

98
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Thank you for waiting.

99
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
That was a perfect parking spot for the driver.

100
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I only stopped for 5 minutes.

101
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Why did you have to put curry on my car?

102
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Why did you have to put curry on my car?

103
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I just put curry on the rice.

104
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I was hungry.

105
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I didn't think the car would be a rice.

106
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:51,000
He had to put curry on the rice for only 5 minutes.

107
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:58,000
The yellow curry and the yellow body of the car attracted him.

108
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
He was surprised.

109
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
He was surprised.

110
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I was surprised.

111
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I suddenly slipped.

112
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
After that, I put my car in the car.

113
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I was surprised.

114
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
It was a big accident.

115
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
It was a big accident.

116
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
It was the biggest accident in my life.

117
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,500
The cold reality of the accident can be felt from the cold ice.

118
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:56,000
It was exactly the Mimocore disaster.

119
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
And finally, the waitress brought this dish.

120
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:22,000
It caused the biggest accident in the history of table accidents.

121
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
The sauce was poured on the hamburger on the table.

122
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,000
The driver's vision was completely taken away by the rising steam.

123
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I don't know what's going on.

124
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Suddenly the front of my eyes turned white.

125
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
After that, it was a big bang.

126
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
And the drivers who were driving around were also sacrificed.

127
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
The car was hit by a heavy accident.

128
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
It finally developed into a third world with a menu.

129
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
There is no last order for traffic accidents.

130
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Roppongi

131
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Matsumatsu-san, you always have Roppongi in your heart.

132
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Yes, I do.

133
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Please tell me the correct way to deal with a black man who is taller than 2 meters.

134
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I said it clearly.

135
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
A black man of 2 meters can't win.

136
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:24,000
This is not a problem of losing.

137
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:33,000
But they are very confident that they have a big body.

138
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
If you have a big body, you will be weak.

139
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Really?

140
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
How do you make it?

141
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:46,000
For example, a black man of 2 meters came from the other side.

142
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
The other side knows that they have a big body.

143
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
That's right.

144
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
How tall are you?

145
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
If you ask me.

146
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
When you go to buy clothes.

147
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Don't say that.

148
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
They are aware of their 2 meters.

149
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
They are aware of their 2 meters.

150
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,000
They are aware of their 2 meters.

151
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
They are aware of their 2 meters.

152
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:22,000
They only think about me.

153
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:28,000
On the contrary, a black man of 2 meters is very cautious.

154
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
That's right.

155
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,000
So they take advantage of the weakness of the other side.

156
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
How do you do that?

157
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
The other side is aware of their 2 meters.

158
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
The other side is aware of their 3 meters.

159
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
That's right.

160
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000
The other side is aware of their 3 meters.

161
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
The other side is aware of their 3 meters.

162
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
The other side is aware of their 3 meters.

163
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
How do you do that?

164
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
What?

165
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
The other side is aware of their 3 meters.

166
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
That's your feeling.

167
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
The other side is different.

168
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
This is Hama-chan.

169
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I said something stupid.

170
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Why is it stupid?

171
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I understand your feeling.

172
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,000
But the other side is 1 meter 60 cm or 70 cm.

173
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
There is no dream that doesn't come true.

174
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
No, no.

175
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Dreams are like that.

176
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Absolutely.

177
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Absolutely.

178
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Absolutely.

179
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Right?

180
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:34,000
For example, if you want to become a cream bread, you can.

181
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
That's absolutely right.

182
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
You can.

183
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
You can.

184
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Why can't I become a cream bread?

185
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
You can.

186
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I can't.

187
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
You can.

188
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I can't.

189
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Why can't I become a cream bread?

190
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
What?

191
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Absolutely.

192
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I can't.

193
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
No, no.

194
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
No matter how many times I look at you, I can't.

195
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:00,000
You wanted to enter Yoshimoto and become popular, didn't you?

196
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Absolutely.

197
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Absolutely.

198
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I understand that.

199
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Your dream came true.

200
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,000
That's stupid.

201
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
That and this are different.

202
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
What you want to sell and what you want to become are different.

203
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
You had a dream, didn't you?

204
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
You had a dream, didn't you?

205
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Dreams are dreams.

206
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
You had a dream, didn't you?

207
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Yes, yes.

208
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
It came true.

209
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
No, no.

210
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
It was good that it came true.

211
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
That's right.

212
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Isn't it?

213
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
That's right.

214
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Then let's go to the next dream.

215
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
That's right.

216
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
So you had a dream that you wanted to succeed in the entertainment world.

217
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
It came true.

218
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Your next goal is to become a cream bread.

219
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Why?

220
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Absolutely.

221
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
This is amazing.

222
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
It's going down.

223
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
It doesn't have to be that fluffy.

224
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
It doesn't have to be fluffy.

225
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
It doesn't have to be hard or fluffy.

226
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
It doesn't have to be delicious or sweet.

227
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,000
It doesn't have to be a cream bread.

228
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,000
It doesn't have to be as much cream as you think.

229
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
What should I do with the poison?

230
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
It doesn't have to be a cream bread.

231
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
If it doesn't work, it will work.

232
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Tell me.

233
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
What should I do to become a cream bread?

234
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Well, well.

235
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Yes?

236
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Yes, yes.

237
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Then, let's go to Yoshimoto now.

238
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Let's go to Yoshimoto and do our best.

239
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Mr. Hamada, what would you say if I asked you what I should do to become a cream bread?

240
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Do you understand that?

241
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I don't understand.

242
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
You say good things in your own way.

243
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
But that kid says good things in his own way.

244
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I don't understand.

245
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I don't understand.

246
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I don't want you to force me to become a cream bread.

247
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
What are you talking about?

248
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Cream bread is your dream.

249
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
No, no.

250
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
You're the one who says it.

251
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I never said I wanted to become a cream bread.

252
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
That's your dream.

253
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I'm not like that.

254
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
What?

255
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
It's your dream.

256
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
No, you said it.

257
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I said it because you said it for the first time.

258
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I didn't say it.

259
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
You said it.

260
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I think it's strange.

261
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I don't want to become a cream bread at all.

262
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I said I wanted to become a bread maker, but you said you wanted to become a cream bread.

263
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I wonder why.

264
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
But I don't want you to give up.

265
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
That's what I'm saying.

266
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Do your best.

267
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Can I become a cream bread?

268
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
No.

269
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I think you can do it.

270
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Cream bread?

271
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:30,000
But when I become a cream bread, I can't do it in a convenience store.

272
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Don't you want to become a cream bread?

273
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
You don't say anything.

274
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I don't want to take you out with me.

275
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
But when that happens, I don't know.

276
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
When that happens, I give up on my dream of becoming a two-meter.

277
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I don't know if I want to become a jam bread.

278
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Then I can join the cream bread and jam bread.

279
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:00,000
What about your jam bread?

280
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I can't accept it.

281
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I can't accept it.

282
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I'm small and I don't know what to do.

283
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
When humans lose their eyesight, they wear glasses.

284
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:20,000
How do wild animals lose their eyesight?

285
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
It's basically the same as humans.

286
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
What do you mean?

287
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I don't rely on animals.

288
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
That's right.

289
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,000
So even if I'm a tiger...

290
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
No, no, no.

291
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I'm asking you how you're going to take care of yourself.

292
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
You're on my side, aren't you?

293
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
If you lose your eyesight, you're going to do this, aren't you?

294
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
No, no, no.

295
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I'm going to grab it and go.

296
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
No, no, no.

297
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I don't know.

298
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Let's do that.

299
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
When you lose your eyesight.

300
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Humans put on glasses and make contact.

301
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
What's the difference?

302
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
The difference is that you have to see it up close.

303
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I don't know if it's moving or not, so I'll do it.

304
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,000
I'll just look at it like this.

305
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Hey, what are you doing?

306
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Why do you have to go?

307
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
So there's no way to fix it.

308
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
There is a way to fix it.

309
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
You have to see it up close.

310
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
That means there's no way to fix it.

311
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
That's right.

312
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,000
In that sense, it's like wearing glasses.

313
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
You're doing it right.

314
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I'm not wearing glasses.

315
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I'm telling you to do it.

316
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
You're wearing glasses.

317
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I'm not wearing glasses.

318
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Have you seen it?

319
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I've seen it.

320
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Where?

321
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I've seen it in pictures.

322
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,000
There's no picture here.

323
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Have you ever seen it up close?

324
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
I've seen it up close.

325
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I've seen a picture of a bust-up.

326
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
A bust-up?

327
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
I've seen a picture of this.

328
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I'm not wearing glasses.

329
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
You're doing it right.

330
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:04,000
If you have a picture of someone who's doing this all of a sudden, it's no use.

331
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Is that true?

332
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
It's a sports type.

333
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
There's a picture of a sports type.

334
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
You're wearing it all the way here.

335
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Sports type.

336
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
No, no, no. There's rubber on the back.

337
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Then you can see it.

338
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,000
There's a piece of paper on top of the rubber.

339
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Are you stupid?

340
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
You're wearing glasses. Don't look down on me.

341
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
I'm sorry.

342
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Matsumoto-san,

343
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:41,000
I heard you know how to make the most fashionable muffler this year.

344
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Please tell me how to make it.

345
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
It's fashionable this year.

346
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Really?

347
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Please tell me.

348
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Everyone wants to know how to make a muffler, right?

349
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Do you know how to make a muffler?

350
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I know.

351
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
I know, I know.

352
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
For example...

353
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Try it on.

354
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
How do I do it?

355
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Normally?

356
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
How do you want it now?

357
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Is it okay?

358
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
If it's easy.

359
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
If it's easy.

360
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
For the time being...

361
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Something like this.

362
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Or...

363
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Something like this.

364
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
You have one.

365
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
I have one.

366
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
The one you just made is the standard, right?

367
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
This usually goes round and round.

368
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
That's right.

369
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
So...

370
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
It's a new breath.

371
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,000
It's a muffler, but it's funny to blow your breath.

372
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
This year's muffler is...

373
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Like this.

374
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:25,000
I can't put it on since I left the house.

375
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
It was really bad just now.

376
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:34,000
You were really far away.

377
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,000
It was like an octopus gun that I washed in an instant.

378
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
No, no.

379
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
That's why you should wear it this year.

380
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:45,000
No, no.

381
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
What do you mean you don't like it?

382
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
I'm sweating.

383
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
This is scary.

384
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:15,000
This is scary.

385
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
I'm sweating.

386
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
This is going to be popular this year.

387
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:26,000
That's why everyone should wear it this year.

388
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:32,000
I'm waiting for the bus from the station to the house.

389
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
My fingers are already in when I'm at the entrance.

390
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Just take it off.

391
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Because it's fashionable.

392
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
That's one of your differences.

393
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
No, no.

394
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:49,000
It's fashionable to have a lot of blood vessels.

395
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
So you don't get confused.

396
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
I don't get confused.

397
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
I don't get confused.

398
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
I don't get confused.

399
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
I don't get confused.

400
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
I don't get confused.

401
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:08,000
I don't get confused.
