1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
If you think it was funny, please send me a postcard.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I don't think there are many people.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I'm interested in this kind of sight.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Today, we are going to Aoyama for the first time.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Yes.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
It's cold today.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
It's cold, isn't it?

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I think it's getting in the way of the sound of the waves.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
What?

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Let's go home because it's fun.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Taxi!

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Taxi!

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I'm going home today.

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
How was it?

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Taxi!

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Taxi!

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
It's getting in the way.

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I want to go home.

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Today, we're going to the showroom.

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Down, down, down.

21
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I don't know where the kids are.

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Yes.

23
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I wonder if anything's changed.

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
This is...

25
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
What?

26
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
This is still...

27
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Don't touch the prototype.

28
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
It's annoying.

29
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
What do you mean, don't touch it?

30
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

31
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
We have to line up again.

32
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
That's right.

33
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Today, we're going to the showroom.

34
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Down, down, down.

35
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I don't know where the kids are.

36
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Let's go.

37
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
It's hard.

38
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
This is hard.

39
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The taxi's stuck.

40
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Let's go.

41
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm going home.

42
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
See you tomorrow.

43
00:01:37,000 --> 00:02:02,000
This program is brought to you by Sunluck, Oyama International Products, and the following sponsors.

44
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Thank you for coming.

45
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Today, we have a lot of things to tell you.

46
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
What do you mean?

47
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Well, I don't know if anyone's seen this, but someone said they saw the Zoom-in morning.

48
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Let's see if anyone's seen it.

49
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Well, I don't know if anyone's seen it.

50
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I saw the first episode.

51
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
The first episode.

52
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I shot the bird in the downtown of the 29th district.

53
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
At that time, you said,

54
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Well, which one of us is going to win?

55
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Let's guess.

56
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
At the 29th stage.

57
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
That's right.

58
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I said red.

59
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
That's right.

60
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
You said white.

61
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Yes.

62
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
What if you lose?

63
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
That's right.

64
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Let's bet.

65
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Yes.

66
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
If you lose,

67
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Oh, it's a little down.

68
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Yeah.

69
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
It's a little ahead.

70
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Oh, I'm sorry.

71
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
If you lose,

72
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Zoom-in morning.

73
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
What if I lose?

74
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
No, it's not.

75
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
It's going down.

76
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I'm the Shina Beach Shogun behind you.

77
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
That's right.

78
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I was dressed like I didn't know what was going on.

79
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
You dressed up as Garara Nyororo.

80
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
That's right.

81
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I'm going to do this behind you.

82
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
That's right.

83
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Well, in the end, at the 29th stage, it was red and white.

84
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
That's right.

85
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Well, it's decided on the 31st.

86
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Well, at that stage, red won.

87
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
That's right.

88
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Well, the 29th was shot on air on the 16th.

89
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
That's right.

90
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
And then at the end, let's meet in five hours.

91
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
On the morning of the 17th, the day after the broadcast,

92
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I promised to come out on Zoom-in on the morning of the next day.

93
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
You came out on the 17th.

94
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Yes.

95
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Zoom-in morning.

96
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Yes.

97
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
That's right.

98
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
That's right.

99
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
It was hard for me.

100
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Well, I told you.

101
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Yeah.

102
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I don't know how the general public sees it, but what was interesting to me was that the general public was behind me.

103
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
There were a lot of amateur customers.

104
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Wait a minute.

105
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Were you watching TV?

106
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Watching?

107
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
You woke me up on the phone.

108
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

109
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
That's right.

110
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I'm the one who says you.

111
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
You!

112
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
You hung up on me at about 6 or 5 o'clock.

113
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I'm going to be on TV now.

114
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
You're so annoying.

115
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Well, I felt nervous when I first appeared on TV.

116
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
There was something I saw.

117
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I was sleeping.

118
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I was sleeping, and the whole thing changed.

119
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
What was interesting?

120
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
So, there was an amateur here, and Mr. Tome was in front of me, right?

121
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
And you were standing at the very end.

122
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Yes, yes, yes.

123
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
With a lot of garala.

124
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Yes.

125
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
That's interesting, but it was a drawing.

126
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
So, Mr. Tome wasn't up.

127
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
It was a little far away.

128
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
It was taken from a distance, so the whole thing was reflected.

129
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Yes.

130
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
At that time, the garala was a number.

131
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Mr. Matsumoto was wearing garala make-up and waiting for the ball.

132
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:58,000
And then, as if the ball had come, the guy who had been doing this until now was waiting for the ball.

133
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
That was so funny.

134
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
That was funny, too.

135
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I was sleepy, but when I saw that, I laughed a lot in the morning.

136
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
This is very popular.

137
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I've seen it.

138
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I've seen it.

139
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Yes, yes, yes.

140
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
That's right.

141
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
But people who haven't seen this program.

142
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
This program is only in the Tokyo area, isn't it?

143
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Yes, yes, yes.

144
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I know a lot of garalas in the area, but people who don't know this program.

145
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
What the hell is this guy doing?

146
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I happened to see it on Zoom.

147
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I was sleeping.

148
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
What is it?

149
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Yes, yes, yes.

150
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I also had an opinion that I thought.

151
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
It was early in the morning for me.

152
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
It was early in the morning.

153
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
And that night.

154
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,000
That night, I was taking care of the baby next week.

155
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Yes, yes, yes.

156
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I was told that I shouldn't let him sleep.

157
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
If I return him to his house?

158
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
If I return him to his house, he'll never come.

159
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
He won't come to the office at 6 o'clock.

160
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Yes, yes, yes.

161
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
And he won't let me go.

162
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
He won't return me.

163
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I was dragged around in various places.

164
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Three men and three staff members.

165
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I had to kill some time by 6 o'clock.

166
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I had to do something.

167
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Suddenly, the men started playing baseball.

168
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
It was a free time.

169
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
There was still plenty of time.

170
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
There was nothing to do, so we played baseball.

171
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Men and men.

172
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Men and men.

173
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Only three men.

174
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
There was a woman.

175
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
It was a baseball game.

176
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
We started playing baseball.

177
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
We were dragged around in various places.

178
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Yes, yes, yes.

179
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
We only played with three men.

180
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
The woman just watched.

181
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
She said it was embarrassing.

182
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
That's right.

183
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
If you play baseball and lose, you have to take it off.

184
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Yes, yes, yes.

185
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
We were dragged around in various places.

186
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Yes, yes, yes.

187
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
We played baseball in reverse.

188
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
In the end, only men.

189
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Three men and three staff members.

190
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
If you do this, no matter how many women you have,

191
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Come on now.

192
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
You guys lost now.

193
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
We're wearing kitchen clothes.

194
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Yes, yes, yes.

195
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
We're wearing only one pair of pants.

196
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I said, isn't it?

197
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I understood.

198
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I was almost cut in half.

199
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
It's a reverse cut.

200
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
It's a reverse cut.

201
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
If you do this, the woman will be in a bad mood again.

202
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Like a clock.

203
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Earrings.

204
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Yes, yes, yes.

205
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Fingers.

206
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
In the end, I thought three men and three staff members were dead.

207
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I dug it out.

208
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I dug it out.

209
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I said, wow.

210
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I thought I'd take the woman off the horse.

211
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
When I looked at it, it was already six o'clock.

212
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I said, I can't fly.

213
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I went to the apartment.

214
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I went without anything.

215
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Yes, yes, yes.

216
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I arrived at the Zoom-in morning.

217
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
It was that morning.

218
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I was tired.

219
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I was really tired at that time.

220
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I used up all my power in baseball.

221
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I met Mr. Tome in the morning.

222
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Really?

223
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Yes.

224
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
After make-up?

225
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Yes.

226
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Yes, yes, yes.

227
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
When I went there without anything, I thought it was a really strange guy.

228
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I've been saying this for a while.

229
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Mr. Tome said, I understand.

230
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
When I opened the lid, Mr. Tome was a little angry.

231
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
But when I said Zoom-in, Mr. Tome was half laughing.

232
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Because it's a little bit behind.

233
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Is that so?

234
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Zoom-in.

235
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I saw it now.

236
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
If you look at it again, you may not be able to laugh.

237
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Certainly, it was a little bit up here.

238
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I don't think everyone will be convinced just by this story.

239
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Mr. Wada brought a camera from the sea that night.

240
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I was able to do it.

241
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I'm taking a video of what it looks like.

242
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Please take a look at it.

243
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Begging of Zoom-in.

244
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Yes, please prepare a little.

245
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
You're a sweaty cameraman.

246
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Today, this place is Honda, so we're going to have a Honda race.

247
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Is it okay around here?

248
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Is it okay around here?

249
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Is it okay here?

250
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Yes, it's okay here.

251
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I'd like you to come out a little earlier and show me a little more of this eating.

252
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I don't think the men will be convinced.

253
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
What kind of work are you doing?

254
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I'm going to a race in the Honda campaign.

255
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
For example, I'm going to a photo shoot.

256
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
What's wrong with your father?

257
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
What's wrong with your father?

258
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
What's wrong with my father?

259
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Oh, really?

260
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
You're so funny.

261
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Thank you very much.

262
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Well, then.

263
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Let's take a look at the morning pattern.

264
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I've never seen it before.

265
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I've never seen it before.

266
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I've never seen it before.

267
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I've never seen it before.

268
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I've never seen it before.

269
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
But the white was amazing.

270
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Yeah.

271
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I'm going to say this.

272
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Let's bet.

273
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
What?

274
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Let's bet.

275
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Which one did you win?

276
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
What do you do if you lose?

277
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Zoom in in the morning like this.

278
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
It's like a battle scene.

279
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I'm going to say this.

280
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
You know what?

281
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
China Pitch Shogun.

282
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
That one?

283
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Oh, you know what?

284
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
It's a little different song.

285
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Galala Nyorororo.

286
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
What?

287
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
You're white, aren't you?

288
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
It's red.

289
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Give me a red one.

290
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
No.

291
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I'm going to buy a menu.

292
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I'm going to buy a menu.

293
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
It's delicious.

294
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I'm going to say this.

295
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
It's still night.

296
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
It's dark.

297
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
It's snowing again for some reason.

298
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
It's a very tough situation.

299
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I didn't have this.

300
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
By the way, I'm off today.

301
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
It's a refreshing morning.

302
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
It's the best.

303
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
This way.

304
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:53,000
But I'm really looking at the staff.

305
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
You have a great face.

306
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I'm doing something.

307
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Stop this music.

308
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
This music is so stupid.

309
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I'm sorry.

310
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Stay here.

311
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Hello.

312
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Hello.

313
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I'm alive.

314
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I'm still alive.

315
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I'm still alive.

316
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I'm still alive.

317
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I'm still alive.

318
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Hello.

319
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I'm going to go.

320
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I'm going to go.

321
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Hey.

322
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Shut up.

323
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Watch TV.

324
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Shut up.

325
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Shut up.

326
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I want to do this.

327
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I want to do this.

328
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Watch TV.

329
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I'm going to call Hanako.

330
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Hey.

331
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Shut up.

332
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Hello.

333
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Hello.

334
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I'm glad that you have my name.

335
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Shut up.

336
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I'm sorry.

337
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Why is the TV on?

338
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
The TV is off.

339
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
It's true.

340
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
The TV is off.

341
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
So, shall we go?

342
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Thank you for your hard work.

343
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Good morning. It's Wednesday, January 17th.

344
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,000
The weather is getting better, isn't it? However, the snow last night is very, very cold.

345
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
It was the coldest winter this winter.

346
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
So if you enter the back road, the snow will be frozen.

347
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Please be careful not to slip.

348
00:13:37,000 --> 00:14:01,000
First of all, let's go to Shizuoka and zoom in.

349
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:07,000
This is the place where the fire department is gathered.

350
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
The number is 146.

351
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,000
154 people were injured.

352
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
It seems that a strange person is coming from the morning.

353
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
There are many people who don't know how to drive on the snowy road.

354
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,000
It's really hard to drive, so there are some people who say they're going up.

355
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:31,000
There is a snowstorm at Narita Airport.

356
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
It seems that it will be able to fly today.

357
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:40,000
However, be careful not to slip in the shade.

358
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Let's zoom in on Nippon Network this morning.

359
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Hello, do you like me?

360
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Will you still look at me as a partner?

361
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I did it.

362
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Did you see it?

363
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Tome-san is a little angry.

364
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Did you see it?

365
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Let's meet again comfortably as if nothing had happened.

366
00:15:49,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Thank you for your hard work.

367
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Next is the bird-human contest in Hamada.

368
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
It's amazing.

369
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I'm glad I was alive when I was blown up by a bird.

370
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Did you see your own bird?

371
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
It wasn't acting at all.

372
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
It was a real bird.

373
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000
The man in the middle has a serious face.

374
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:41,000
There was a person who really came to see this program.

375
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:49,000
It was amazing.

376
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,000
It was fun.

377
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I won't let it end like this.

378
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I'm thinking about you.

379
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:11,000
There is a pro-wrestler called Zen Nippon Pro-Wrestler.

380
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Bring a bouquet of flowers and go to a masked wrestler.

381
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Bring a bouquet of flowers and go to a masked wrestler.

382
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Bring a bouquet of flowers and go to a masked wrestler.

383
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
You are scary.

384
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
You are scary.

385
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:38,000
The person who saw the video knew how to become a bird.

386
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
First, put white on the base.

387
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Anyone can see it.

388
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Anyone can see it.

389
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
It was fun.

390
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I was a little angry that I was called.

391
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Let's shake hands.

392
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Let's do something.

393
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Let's do something.

394
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Let's do something.

395
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Let's do something.

396
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Look, look.

397
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Look, look.

398
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I'm going to take it out of the middle and put it on the face.

399
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I've been doing this for a long time.

400
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I've been doing this for a long time.

401
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
This is delicious.

402
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
This is delicious.

403
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Let's decide with rock-paper-scissors.

404
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
No.

405
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Let's decide with rock-paper-scissors.

406
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Let's decide with rock-paper-scissors.

407
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Rock-paper-scissors doesn't make sense.

408
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Let's decide with rock-paper-scissors.

409
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Let's decide with rock-paper-scissors.

410
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Rock-paper-scissors.

411
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Rock-paper-scissors.

412
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Rock-paper-scissors.

413
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I'm serious.

414
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
I'm serious.

415
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I'm serious.

416
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
What about the punishment?

417
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
It's not a team, it's just the two of us working together.

418
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
The two of us working together.

419
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
This is really important.

420
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
What's the distance between the two of you?

421
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
The distance between the two of us is...

422
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
It's about 10 meters.

423
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
That's right.

424
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
It's not that far.

425
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
That's right.

426
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
That's why I'll try my best to make it.

427
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
You can't fly to me.

428
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
You can't fly to me.

429
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I'll think about it.

430
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Please bring me a postcard.

431
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
It was really...

432
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
It was fun, wasn't it?

433
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
It was really fun.

434
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
We don't have much time today.

435
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
It was a good opportunity.

436
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Like this.

437
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Bring the camera outside.

438
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
There's a lot of things.

439
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Let's keep doing it.

440
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Let's do it.

441
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Please appear on this program.

442
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Let's do that.

443
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
How about doing this?

444
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
If you lose, you should do this.

445
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I'll have a lecture about how to move in a different direction.

446
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I'll have a lecture about how to move in a different direction.

447
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
You know how to do it.

448
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
I'll have a lecture about how to move in a different direction.

449
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Why didn't you go to Nagoya?

450
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
You're right.

451
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Let me briefly introduce you to the story.

452
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
There was a story about a fan of Hama-chan and Mach-chan.

453
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
There was a story about a fan of Hama-chan and Mach-chan.

454
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
My friend, Hama-chan's fan...

455
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Please draw this in your head.

456
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
My friend, Hama-chan's fan...

457
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Height 170 cm,

458
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
without a chin,

459
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,000
He is like a cat that is connected from the neck to the face.

460
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:48,000
And when he laughs, he blows his nose like this.

461
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
This is the kind of fan I am.

462
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
What is that?

463
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,000
This is the kind of fan I am.

464
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
That's nice.

465
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,000
But earlier, we talked about baseball.

466
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I don't know if you think it's strange,

467
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
but I'm not embarrassed.

468
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
It's not embarrassing to see me poop.

469
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
I am.

470
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
It's strange, isn't it?

471
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Yes, it's embarrassing.

472
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Why?

473
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
You've seen it before, haven't you?

474
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Who?

475
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
You've seen it before, haven't you?

476
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
No, I haven't.

477
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
The most embarrassing thing was that I forgot to lock the door.

478
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I can't say that I saw it,

479
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
but I forgot to lock the door.

480
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I even forgot that I didn't lock the door.

481
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
I was knocked on the door.

482
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I was knocked on the door, so I had to knock back.

483
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
When I knocked on the door, the door opened.

484
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I didn't lock the door.

485
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I opened the door with my own power.

486
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I didn't see anything.

487
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
I want to show it to you.

488
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
I was injured.

489
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
We talked about dirty things at the end,

490
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
but I'm sure there are things like that.

491
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
It was really interesting,

492
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
so I tried to go outside like that.

493
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Like I said earlier,

494
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
please look forward to it.

495
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
That's all for now.

496
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
See you next week.

497
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Thank you very much, everyone.

498
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
It was really interesting today.

499
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
It was so much fun.

500
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
What should I do?

501
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
What do you think?

502
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
People who watch TV

503
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
are less likely to say it's a joke, aren't they?

504
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
But when I look at the postcards,

505
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
there are a lot of people who want me to do more jokes.

506
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Is that so?

507
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
You can write a joke.

508
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Is it a tsunami?

509
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
No, I just want to see it.

510
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
I want to see what kind of joke it is.

511
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
I don't think it's funny anymore,

512
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
but I want to do it when I get home.

513
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
I want you to put out a drama or something.

514
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
There is such a thing.

515
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
For example, Yoko-giru.

516
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Maybe after a month,

517
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
if you look at the postcards,

518
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
there will be a joke in it.

519
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,000
It's like I'm in it.

520
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
It's so funny.

521
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
It's so funny.

522
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
As usual,

523
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
if you have any questions,

524
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
please leave them in the comments.

525
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
It's not a punishment game,

526
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
but if you lose in a game like this,

527
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
you can watch this kind of program.

528
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Please leave them in the comments.

529
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
We'll be waiting for you.

530
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Thank you for watching.

531
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
See you next week.

532
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Thank you for watching.
