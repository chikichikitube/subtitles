00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Chiki Chiki's once a year event! Let's have a great time!

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Let's forget about work and have a great time!

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Kogoriko, how was your first year?

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
How was it?

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Kogoriko, congratulations!

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
You're really like Kogoriko.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I was born as a child of a gag called Hohohoi.

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
It was a year that was dyed in only that.

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
How was your first year?

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Good luck!

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
How was your first year in Downtown?

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
It was a good year.

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
You didn't invite me before.

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Cheers!

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
This program is brought to you by these sponsors.

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Let's get started!

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Let's have an apple competition!

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Let's start with the first one.

19
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
It's number 16, Ai.

20
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
It's number 16, Ai.

21
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
It's number 32, N.

22
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
It's number 31, Ai.

23
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
It's number 21, Ai.

24
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Bingo!

25
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Bingo!

26
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Good morning.

27
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Good morning.

28
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Wait a minute.

29
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I only said three words.

30
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
It's bingo, right?

31
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Where was it?

32
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Good morning.

33
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I'm sorry I'm late.

34
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Did you say you're late?

35
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Yes.

36
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
It's a tradition.

37
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
What's wrong with the board?

38
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
There's a leech, but there's no bingo.

39
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
It's number 16, Ai.

40
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
It's number 32, N.

41
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
It's bingo.

42
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
There's a leech, but there's no bingo.

43
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Everyone's got a product.

44
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Everyone's got a product.

45
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Oh, a board?

46
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Yes.

47
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
That's what it is.

48
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I'll take this one out.

49
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I'll take it out.

50
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Wait a minute.

51
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Is this okay?

52
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
It's fresh, isn't it?

53
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
No, it's not.

54
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
No, it's not.

55
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Who is it?

56
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
It's my wife.

57
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I'm hungry.

58
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
What are you talking about?

59
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
What's this?

60
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
It's my child.

61
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Harumi.

62
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Harumi?

63
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Harumi?

64
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Can I adjust the order?

65
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
It doesn't matter.

66
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
It's bingo.

67
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
It's getting more and more bingo.

68
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
It's getting more and more bingo.

69
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Congratulations.

70
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Congratulations on the bingo.

71
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Thank you.

72
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Thank you.

73
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Let's move on.

74
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Wait a minute.

75
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Let's move on.

76
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
One more product.

77
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
What?

78
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
This is bingo, too.

79
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I don't like this.

80
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
It's different.

81
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
It's bingo, right?

82
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Of course.

83
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
The types are completely different.

84
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
It's different.

85
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
The dough is different.

86
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I'm so frustrated.

87
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I'm so frustrated.

88
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I'm so frustrated.

89
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I'm so frustrated.

90
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I'm so frustrated.

91
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I'm so frustrated.

92
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I'm so frustrated.

93
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Let's do it at a good tempo.

94
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Let's do it at a good tempo.

95
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Congratulations.

96
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Thank you.

97
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Thank you.

98
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Let's go.

99
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Let's go.

100
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Let's go.

101
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
It's out.

102
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
It's No. 68.

103
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
It's No. 68.

104
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
It's N.

105
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Let's go.

106
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
It's N.

107
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
It's bingo.

108
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
It's bingo.

109
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
It's bingo.

110
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Excuse me.

111
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
What is this?

112
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
What is this?

113
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
What is this?

114
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
There is no prototype.

115
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
There is no standard.

116
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
It's bingo.

117
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
You just wrote this, didn't you?

118
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
What?

119
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
The free is at the edge.

120
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
That's not funny.

121
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
It's bingo, right?

122
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
It's bingo, right?

123
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
It's not bingo, right?

124
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
It's a normal paper, isn't it?

125
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
It's bingo.

126
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
It's a child's work.

127
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
It's a child's work.

128
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I want to say bingo.

129
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I want to say bingo.

130
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I'm here to say bingo.

131
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I'm here to say bingo.

132
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
There is a rule.

133
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I may have said bingo too much.

134
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Right?

135
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
It's bingo, bingo, bingo.

136
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Are you okay?

137
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
It's bingo, bingo, bingo.

138
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
You look like you just got out of bed.

139
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
He was talking.

140
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
He was talking.

141
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Harumi-chan.

142
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
You're an adult.

143
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
You're saying bingo, but you don't know what to do.

144
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Call an ambulance.

145
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
That's enough.

146
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Call an ambulance.

147
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
That's enough.

148
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Are you okay?

149
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Are you okay?

150
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Are you okay?

151
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I got it.

152
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
That's enough.

153
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
That's enough.

154
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
That's enough.

155
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
That's enough.

156
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Let's do it.

157
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Let's do it.

158
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
It's B3.

159
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
It's B3.

160
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
It's B3.

161
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
It's B3.

162
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
This is a bit...

163
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Super Famicom is a bit...

164
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
It's a child's game.

165
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
It's fine.

166
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Is it this?

167
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Bingo, bingo, bingo.

168
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
This is the most eye-catching.

169
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I don't think kids will understand even if I give them a DVD.

170
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I think they will be happy with the game.

171
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
That's not true.

172
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
You think so too, don't you?

173
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Of course I do.

174
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I told you.

175
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Of course I do.

176
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
What?

177
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I don't think so.

178
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I told you I don't think so.

179
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
What is this?

180
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Uji, give me all of them.

181
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
This is the most eye-catching.

182
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
This is the most eye-catching.

183
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
What are you doing?

184
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I'm your junior, but...

185
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Why are you pulling it so hard?

186
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I can't give it to you.

187
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I can't give it to you.

188
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I'll give you this.

189
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I'll give you this.

190
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I'll give you this.

191
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I got it.

192
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I'll give it to you later.

193
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I'll give you this.

194
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I'll give you this DVD.

195
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Let's do it.

196
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
But...

197
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
What should we do?

198
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
What should we do?

199
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
How about Bingo?

200
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Can we do that?

201
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Let's do it.

202
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
At rock-paper-scissors,

203
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
we'll give away a Hawaii record!

204
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Thank you.

205
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
It's fair.

206
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
At this time of the year...

207
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
At this time of the year...

208
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
That's amazing.

209
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I'll tell you.

210
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
The person who gets Aiko will lose.

211
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
The person who gets Aiko will lose.

212
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
That's great.

213
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Rock-paper-scissors!

214
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Are you ready?

215
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Rock-paper-scissors!

216
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Rock-paper-scissors!

217
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Rock-paper-scissors!

218
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Rock-paper-scissors!

219
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Rock-paper-scissors!

220
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Again?

221
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Sorry.

222
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
What's wrong?

223
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I was looking at my dad.

224
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
He changed.

225
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
He changed.

226
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
At first, it was Aiko.

227
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
It was obvious.

228
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
It was obvious.

229
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
It was obvious.

230
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
At rock-paper-scissors,

231
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Aiko loses.

232
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I was looking at Itao.

233
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I was looking at Itao.

234
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
It was Aiko.

235
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I was looking at Itao.

236
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Let's go to the front and do it here.

237
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Let's do it here.

238
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Can we do it in the front?

239
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Let's do it in the front.

240
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Can we do it in the front?

241
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Hawaii.

242
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
In California.

243
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Rock-paper-scissors!

244
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I won.

245
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I won.

246
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Look at it.

247
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
There's nothing wrong with it.

248
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I won.

249
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
How was it?

250
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I was looking at it in front of me.

251
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I changed.

252
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I changed.

253
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I didn't change.

254
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I didn't change.

255
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
What's wrong with you?

256
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Sorry.

257
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I didn't change.

258
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Don't say it.

259
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
In the end, there are only three people who won.

260
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
That's good.

261
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I don't know.

262
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I don't know who won again.

263
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I don't know how I won.

264
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I don't know how I did it.

265
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I don't know.

266
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
If you give me Hawaii, I'll give it to you.

267
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I'll give you a pair.

268
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I'll give you a pair for one trip to Hawaii.

269
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I'll give you a pair for one trip to Hawaii.

270
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Are you alone in Hawaii?

271
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I'll ask you the other way around. Can you go alone in Hawaii?

272
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
It's Hawaii.

273
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
On such a large scale.

274
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Alone?

275
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
There's a lot of food there.

276
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
You can't go alone.

277
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
So what?

278
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
It's for the family.

279
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
If it's for the family, it's a pair.

280
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
It's impossible for three people.

281
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I have a neck pain, but I'm wearing it.

282
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
What's wrong with your neck?

283
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I got hit before.

284
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Is it still healed?

285
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
It's almost healed.

286
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I'll do it.

287
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I'll do it.

288
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Bring it home.

289
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
It's too late.

290
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I don't have any more.

291
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Thank you.

292
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Please do something for one person.

293
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I understand.

294
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I'll give you a pair for one trip to Hawaii.

295
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I'll give you a pair for one trip to Hawaii.

296
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I'll give you a pair for one trip to Hawaii.

297
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Thank you for your hard work.

298
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Thank you.

299
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Have a good year.

300
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Did you learn Japanese?

301
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Did you read it?

302
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I read it.

303
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
You didn't read it, did you?

304
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I'll give you a pair for one trip to Hawaii.

305
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Matsumoto-san.

306
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Matsumoto-san.

307
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
It's probably over with this face.

308
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Machan, baby.

309
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Hi, hi.

310
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Machan is so cute.

311
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Machan is so cute.

312
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Why Machan?

313
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Machan.

314
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Machan, baby.

315
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Hanna-chan, lady.

316
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Hanna-chan, lady.

317
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Hanna-chan, lady.

318
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
It's difficult.

319
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I told you.

320
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Let's change it right away.

321
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Oh, yes.

322
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I'll change it to Bohemian.

323
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
It's too late to change it to Bohemian.

324
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Is that so?

325
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I'll give you a new one when I get older.

326
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I see.

327
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
But Donkey Kong 64 is interesting.

328
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I've been playing it for a long time.

329
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I don't know.

330
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I've never played it, so I don't know if it's interesting.

331
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
It's fun.

332
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
What's interesting?

333
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
It's like this.

334
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Five monkeys come out.

335
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
If there's a barrel and it goes into the barrel, it changes.

336
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
It's different.

337
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
It's fun.

338
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
That's what people who play it do.

339
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
If you get hooked on it, it's big.

340
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
It's a waste of time.

341
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I can't stop it.

342
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Is that so?

343
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I feel like I'm getting a tattoo on my brain.

344
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Well, it looks like you know.

345
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
You look like you're having a hard time.

346
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Even if I'm sleeping, they keep coming out.

347
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Even if I'm eating, I'm like,

348
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Why don't you go over there next time?

349
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
What are you going to do if you're so addicted to it?

350
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
There's a coin over there.

351
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Why don't you go over there?

352
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I can't do it anymore.

353
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
That's how it is.

354
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I had a fight with a foreigner the other day.

355
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I parked my car at the parking lot of my house.

356
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
He said,

357
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I'm in this room.

358
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
He put a sticker on it.

359
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
He's hiding it.

360
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
He said he was in this room.

361
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
You know he's in the way, right?

362
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
He said,

363
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Come to me.

364
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
It means welcome.

365
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
He came out and he was a white man.

366
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
He was about two meters tall.

367
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
He had a big chest.

368
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
You can't come over there.

369
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
He said, I don't understand Japanese.

370
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I said, I don't understand anything.

371
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
When I got on the elevator,

372
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
A foreigner suddenly got angry.

373
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
He said something.

374
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I don't understand English.

375
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
He was in the elevator.

376
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
He was in the elevator all the time.

377
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
He was in this distance all the time.

378
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I don't know what it is.

379
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
It's a long story.

380
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Did he get excited?

381
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
He's excited.

382
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I'm hungry.

383
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
You should have hit him.

384
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
He was about two meters tall.

385
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
What if he hits you from above?

386
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Me?

387
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Why?

388
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I can dodge a lot of things.

389
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I can dodge a lot of things.

390
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I can dodge more than you think.

391
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I'm big, right?

392
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
What if he hits you from above?

393
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I can't do that.

394
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I'll fix his joints.

395
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Like this?

396
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
How do you fix it?

397
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
He's a king.

398
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I just sandwiched him.

399
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I know you're broken.

400
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I'm not broken.

401
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Be patient.

402
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I'm not broken.

403
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
As expected of a comedian.

404
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
He's broken, but he's not broken.

405
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I'm not broken.

406
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
If you want to get rid of him, you have to get along with him.

407
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I know how to get along with him.

408
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:30,000
No matter how big he is, even if he's a gorilla, he can't bend like this.

409
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
That's right.

410
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
It's okay if you know that.

411
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:42,000
There's a way to do it like this.

412
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
When he's like this, you can go to the movies.

413
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
To the movies.

414
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
You can go to watch a love story.

415
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I have a question for Mr. Matsumoto, who has a charismatic way of shaking his chin.

416
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
My chin is shaking.

417
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Please tell me how to fix it.

418
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
This is unpleasant.

419
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
What are you talking about?

420
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
This is the chosen race.

421
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I'm a ugly chin monster.

422
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Can you fix it?

423
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Can't you fix it?

424
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Just tell me.

425
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I really hate it.

426
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Originally, we humans came from a crooked place.

427
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
That's right.

428
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Is that so?

429
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Yes.

430
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Originally, humans were monkeys.

431
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Yes.

432
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Do you understand?

433
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Yes, I understand.

434
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
The monkey was shaking the tree.

435
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
That's right.

436
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
At that time, it didn't shake because it was a monkey.

437
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Was there a reason?

438
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
That's right.

439
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Why?

440
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,000
There was a person who said, let's get off the tree.

441
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
At that time, he said, don't say stupid things.

442
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
It's fun to get off the tree.

443
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
But that's not true.

444
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
There are many adventures on the earth.

445
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
You have to broaden your horizons.

446
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
There was a monkey who said that.

447
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
He got off the tree and shook the tree.

448
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
He shook the tree.

449
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:18,000
By shaking the tree, he was able to go around the town.

450
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
That's right.

451
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
When he got off the tree, he was shaking the tree.

452
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Everyone was shouting, let's continue.

453
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
When he got off the tree, everyone was shaking the tree.

454
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:45,000
For example, when I was a kid, I was with Tanaka.

455
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
We are of the same race.

456
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,000
We only know each other by the shape of our chin.

457
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
The shape of our chin.

458
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
The shape of our chin.

459
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Tanaka will explain it to you.

460
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I've never seen it.

461
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
It's more than any sake.

462
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
It's more than any pot.

463
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,000
It's more than any trip.

464
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
It's more than any trip.

465
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
You can't do this, can you?

466
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
But I don't know about you.

467
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
But there are so many amazing people.

468
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Among us Shidoku, there is Antonio.

469
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
He is amazing.

470
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
He is shaking the tree.

471
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Really?

472
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
He has a different rank.

473
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
He is much higher.

474
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
He is much higher.

475
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
He is above the clouds.

476
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
He can't speak.

477
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
He can't do that to you.

478
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
You have to find him.

479
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
You have such a big mouth.

480
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
I understand.

481
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
There is no one else, right?

482
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
I don't know.

483
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I understand.

484
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Kishida...

485
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Kyouko?

486
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Kyouko.

487
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
He doesn't do that to you.

488
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
What?

489
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:29,000
For example, when Kishida-san is eating at a restaurant, I go and...

490
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
He gets really angry.

491
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
What?

492
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,000
He says, I can't eat it.

493
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Because he is from a different race.

494
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
But when you do that, it's amazing.

495
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
You have a big mouth.

496
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Sometimes when you have a big mouth, you have a big mouth.

497
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
This is complicated.

498
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
When you say wine, it's like rosé.

499
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,000
When the washing machine is running, what is going on?

500
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
I think it's a little party.

501
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
For example, what will you be?

502
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
A T-shirt or something.

503
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
A T-shirt?

504
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Heinz?

505
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Heinz.

506
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
What will I be?

507
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
A bra?

508
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Can I be a bra?

509
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
When it's like this...

510
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
What kind of laugh will Heinz make?

511
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
The water will come in.

512
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:57,000
At that time, I'll be a bra.

513
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
It's like this.

514
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
There's nothing more fun than this.

515
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
What do you think?

516
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
I'm standing up straight now.

517
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Now it's just Heinz and a bra.

518
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
There's a lot more.

519
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
There are more things here.

520
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Pants, socks...

521
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
The socks brothers will come.

522
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
One person will come.

523
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
One person will come.

524
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
The American with the socks will come.

525
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Hello, hello.

526
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
My name is socks.

527
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,000
The socks you lost is American.

528
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
The socks you lost is American.

529
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Hello.

530
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Hello, Japan is fun.

531
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Where did you come from?

532
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
I think it's really fun.

533
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
I want to be like that.

534
00:23:51,000 --> 00:24:05,000
But when I open it, I think humans are watching.
