1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
We won! The losing team will be punished!

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
We did it!

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
It's cold here!

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Only the winning team was given these clothes!

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
It's so warm!

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
But!

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
In this cold, such brave men came!

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Over there! Look!

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
We won!

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
They are just idiots!

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Cool!

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
This program is brought to you by the following sponsors.

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Look at that rough wave!

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
From now on, you guys will head towards that rough wave!

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Okay?

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Okay.

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
We won!

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
We won!

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
We won!

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
We won!

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
We won!

22
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
We won!

23
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
It doesn't matter if it's cold!

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
We won!

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
You guys are in the middle of the ocean!

26
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
When you come up, something is waiting for you!

27
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Put your energy into it!

28
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Are you ready?

29
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Are you okay?

30
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Okay, if I shoot, you will follow me!

31
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Let's go!

32
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
You are the best!

33
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Let's go!

34
00:01:31,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Let's go!

35
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I'm sorry!

36
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Let's go!

37
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I'm sorry!

38
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Let's go!

39
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Let's go!

40
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Let's go!

41
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I'm sorry!

42
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Let's go!

43
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I'm sorry!

44
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
It hurts!

45
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
My body hurts!

46
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
My body hurts!

47
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
It hurts!

48
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Let's go!

49
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Sir!

50
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Yes?

51
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Hey!

52
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Bring me that bag!

53
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Let's go!

54
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Let's go!

55
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Let's go!

56
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Moriyasu!

57
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Yes?

58
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Put this on!

59
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
You are going to swim in the sea of monsters!

60
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Let's go!

61
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Sir!

62
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Sir, bring this!

63
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Masumoto, bring this!

64
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Bring this!

65
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Bring this!

66
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
What are you doing?

67
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
What are you doing?

68
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Bring this!

69
00:03:50,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I'm sorry!

70
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Let's go!

71
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I really worked hard today.

72
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I don't know what to say.

73
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I'm really sorry to have kept you waiting.

74
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Today, I really...

75
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Wow!

76
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
What's with your face?

77
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
You see...

78
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
What's with your face?

79
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
You see...

80
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I'm really tired today.

81
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I'm exhausted.

82
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
You have a companion.

83
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
So when I'm tired,

84
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
no matter what I do, my face dies.

85
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
That's why it's like this.

86
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
When I'm tired,

87
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I do my make-up like this.

88
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
That's how I show it.

89
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
That's how I show it.

90
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
That's how I show it.

91
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
But your face says you're tired.

92
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
My head goes bang, bang.

93
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Why?

94
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Because of what I did.

95
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I jumped in.

96
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
It was really cold.

97
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
When I got tired,

98
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I screamed.

99
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I couldn't scream because it was cold.

100
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I've never done it before because it was cold.

101
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
When I screamed,

102
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
my head went bang, bang.

103
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
My head went bang, bang.

104
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
You were the loudest.

105
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Well, that's because I'm a stage performer.

106
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
It doesn't matter.

107
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
You were the loudest when 10 people came in.

108
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
What?

109
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I was in the microwave that day.

110
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I was in the microwave that day.

111
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
It was really cold.

112
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
That's how cold my body was.

113
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I'm tired today.

114
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I'm sorry I can't talk.

115
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
That's that.

116
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
The opening is over.

117
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
It doesn't matter.

118
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I'll talk about the penalty game when I watch the VTR.

119
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
You did it last week.

120
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
He's taking a break.

121
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
That's it.

122
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
You're not a backup.

123
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
If you take a break with such a simple feeling,

124
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I can't do it.

125
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
It was hard.

126
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
That's a lie.

127
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
If you have a voice, you can come.

128
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I couldn't come.

129
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I'm sure I'll come.

130
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I'm going to pee.

131
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I walked a step.

132
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
It was a pee that was about to come out.

133
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
That's not good.

134
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I'm going to pee while I'm on the show.

135
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I'm going to pee while I'm on the show.

136
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I'm going to pee while I'm on the show.

137
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Who's going to blame you?

138
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
You're the best.

139
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I'm going to pee while I'm on the show.

140
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I had a fever.

141
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
It's not that bad.

142
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I'm going to take a break.

143
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I'm told that.

144
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
What's your fever?

145
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
30.

146
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Wait a minute.

147
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
You should have started at 40.

148
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I'm going to pee while I'm on the show.

149
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I can't do it.

150
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I couldn't do it.

151
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I couldn't do it.

152
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I'm sure you can.

153
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
If you walk, you'll pee.

154
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
What are you going to do?

155
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Don't you have a family?

156
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Don't you have a family?

157
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Use that.

158
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I didn't pee on that day.

159
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
You can't do that.

160
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
If you pee all the time, you can't do it.

161
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I don't have a family.

162
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I don't have a family.

163
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I don't have a family.

164
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I was surprised.

165
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I was surprised.

166
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I was surprised.

167
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I was surprised.

168
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I was surprised.

169
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I was surprised.

170
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
It's a tough situation.

171
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
It's a tough situation.

172
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I think.

173
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I played a penalty game today.

174
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
The baseball game is over.

175
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
It's too early to play a penalty game.

176
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I'm going to take a break.

177
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I'm going to take a break.

178
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I want to play something soon.

179
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I can't forget today's frustration.

180
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Do you want to play the second round of sports?

181
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,800
Gyo-san, you've lost many times in the opening, but it's not a punishment game.

182
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,200
That's right, that's right.

183
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,000
All the games I won were just a game in the opening.

184
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I didn't play it as a punishment game.

185
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,800
That's right.

186
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,800
You played billiards, too.

187
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,000
I lost that time, too.

188
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,800
You can't play billiards, can you?

189
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,300
No, if I played it once.

190
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:53,700
What?

191
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:57,000
The first time, it started when I was in Gaki no Sky.

192
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,100
There's no second time in this program.

193
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,200
There was one time, right?

194
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,100
Shut up, you guys!

195
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:05,900
I don't care if you play it or not.

196
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:09,200
If you don't laugh there, you'll be punished at least once.

197
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,200
Then you'll probably be dragged around.

198
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,900
I want to see that kind of audience once.

199
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,200
Oh, really.

200
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,200
It's funny, isn't it?

201
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,200
You bought it once.

202
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,400
That's right.

203
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,200
Let's do something again.

204
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:20,700
Really?

205
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:21,400
Yeah.

206
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,400
Do something.

207
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,400
Yeah.

208
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,600
What do you want to do?

209
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,800
I want to do judo.

210
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,100
Oh, let's do it, let's do it, let's do it.

211
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:27,600
Sounds fun.

212
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,100
Really?

213
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:28,800
Yeah.

214
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,300
Let's really do it.

215
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,100
Yeah, let's do it, let's do it.

216
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:31,400
It's judo, right?

217
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,600
This is really really good.

218
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:35,100
I got it.

219
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,000
I got it, I got it.

220
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,200
Let's do it, let's do it, let's do it.

221
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,200
Oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my.

222
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,600
You know the greatness of my judo, don't you?

223
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,600
No, I don't know if I know it or not, but it looks interesting.

224
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,400
You're still doing a draft.

225
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:50,400
I'm saying this, but I can't do a cat in the air three times in a row.

226
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:53,700
That's not Nyanco Sensei.

227
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:57,400
Then I'll take you up there once.

228
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,000
You'd better not do that, really.

229
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,200
No, let's do it.

230
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:06,200
Let's do it.

231
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,400
What?

232
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:10,400
Try it on.

233
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,600
What?

234
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,400
What?

235
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:31,400
Try it on.

236
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:34,200
You know.

237
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:38,800
You're still doing a draft.

238
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,600
You're still doing a draft.

239
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,200
You're still doing a draft.

240
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,400
You're dirty.

241
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,200
What's dirty?

242
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:51,200
You didn't resist at all.

243
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,200
You're really.

244
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:56,400
It's dirty, so throw it to me, throw it to me.

245
00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:01,400
I'm tired, and I'm called Matsumoto with a hard-wired.

246
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,400
What kind of?

247
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,700
I can't throw it, I'm good at holding it.

248
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:05,000
Hold it, hold it, hold it.

249
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:12,800
What kind of?

250
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,600
I'm just holding it.

251
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,000
I can't get this up.

252
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,800
You're standing up right now.

253
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,600
That's not the main show.

254
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:24,200
Then solidify it properly.

255
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:27,200
I'll solidify it.

256
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,200
Are you ready?

257
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:31,700
Are you ready?

258
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,700
Shut up!

259
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,700
Don't change the picture!

260
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,700
What do you mean, don't change the picture?

261
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,700
What do you mean, don't change the picture?

262
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,700
Shut up!

263
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,700
What do you mean, don't change the picture?

264
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,700
Shut up!

265
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,700
Judo is not interesting at all.

266
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:51,700
Barbell.

267
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:53,700
What is a barbell?

268
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,700
I know what a barbell is.

269
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:59,700
What is a barbell?

270
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,700
I like barbells.

271
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:03,700
I like the enthusiasm of the barbell.

272
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:05,700
Ha!

273
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,700
Ha!

274
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,700
That's why I said ha! barbell.

275
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,700
It's okay.

276
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,700
Let's fight.

277
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,700
If you lose, you'll get a little punishment.

278
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,700
What kind of punishment?

279
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,700
What kind of punishment?

280
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:21,700
That's amazing.

281
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,700
No, you know what?

282
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,700
If you lose, you'll get punished.

283
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:27,700
If you lose, you'll get punished.

284
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,700
I'll have to do something fun.

285
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,700
The loser goes to the SM club.

286
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,700
If you win, you can lose.

287
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,700
What are you talking about?

288
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,700
I'll beat you up.

289
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,700
I'll beat you up.

290
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,700
I'm not interested.

291
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,700
What are you talking about?

292
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,700
I don't know.

293
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,700
I can't beat you up.

294
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,700
I'm embarrassed.

295
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,700
You're a fool!

296
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:57,700
You're a fool!

297
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,700
You're a fool.

298
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,700
You're a fool.

299
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:05,700
I heard about a girl who was working at the SM club.

300
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,700
You're working?

301
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,700
What is it?

302
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:11,700
I've done it once.

303
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:15,700
I'm talking to a girl who's really been working.

304
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,700
What is it?

305
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,700
I'm talking to a girl who's really been working.

306
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,700
I'm talking to a girl who's really been working.

307
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,700
What is it?

308
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,700
I'm talking to a girl who's really been working.

309
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,700
What is it?

310
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:31,700
I heard there are a lot of perverted men coming to the SM club.

311
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,700
I heard they eat poop.

312
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,700
That's a scandal.

313
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,700
They want to take a dump.

314
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:41,700
They eat poop under the bed.

315
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:45,700
You go to the toilet?

316
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:55,700
And then, Owarotan, Owarotan brought the poop to the toilet and told me to put it here.

317
00:13:55,700 --> 00:14:02,700
He said that he would bring the poop to the toilet in a different state.

318
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:05,700
He said that he would put it in the refrigerator at home.

319
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:09,700
He said that he would clean it up again when it was dirty.

320
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:10,700
Honemata!

321
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,700
Honemata!

322
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:15,700
Hello.

323
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:18,700
You're not an amateur today, are you?

324
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:23,700
You're not an amateur, so you should talk more.

325
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:24,700
What's your name?

326
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:25,700
I'm Aizawa Kaori.

327
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:26,700
What are you looking at?

328
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:27,700
I'm looking at...

329
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:29,700
I'm looking at...

330
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,700
I'm looking at you.

331
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:33,700
You're not a man!

332
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:36,700
Oh, it came out again.

333
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:39,700
You're a pro today.

334
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:40,700
Yes.

335
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:42,700
Thank you very much.

336
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:48,700
Chichikuri Manbo-san.

337
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:50,700
Good evening, Machiyama-chan.

338
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:53,700
I always want to quit smoking, but I can't.

339
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:56,700
Machiyama-chan, you smoke, but have you ever thought of quitting?

340
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:58,700
Have I ever thought of quitting?

341
00:14:58,700 --> 00:14:59,700
Me?

342
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:02,700
No, I've never thought of quitting.

343
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,700
You quit when you have a cold or a sore throat, right?

344
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:05,700
No, I don't quit.

345
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:08,700
I've decided to quit once and I'll keep doing it until the end.

346
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:12,700
No, you just quit because you think it's useless.

347
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:13,700
I've decided to quit once.

348
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,700
No, I'll definitely quit.

349
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,700
But recently, smoking is...

350
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:19,700
Smoking is amazing, isn't it?

351
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:21,700
That's strange, isn't it?

352
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:25,700
You don't need to smoke or anything like that.

353
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:29,700
But there are people who smoke on the Shinkansen, too.

354
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:30,700
That's why.

355
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:36,700
The feeling of having to put up with smoking for an hour and the feeling of not wanting to smoke while sitting next to you.

356
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,700
Which one is bigger?

357
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:41,700
That's because the person who can put up with smoking is much bigger.

358
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:44,700
That's because the person who can put up with smoking is much bigger.

359
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:48,700
I wonder if I can cry about that.

360
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:49,700
It's about the same.

361
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:50,700
I get angry.

362
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:53,700
I want to smoke, but I don't know why I don't smoke.

363
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:54,700
That's not true.

364
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:59,700
And even if you don't smoke, you might get cancer just sitting next to you.

365
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:02,700
I wonder if it's better to smoke that kind of thing.

366
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,700
I'm putting my life on the line to smoke.

367
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,700
I don't have the right to be told off by you guys.

368
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:12,700
You're putting your life on the line just to smoke.

369
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:13,700
That's true.

370
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:14,700
I only smoke.

371
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:15,700
What do you hate?

372
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:16,700
I hate natto.

373
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:18,700
I eat natto.

374
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:21,700
I'm sitting next to people and eating natto.

375
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,700
I don't want that.

376
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:26,700
I don't care if there's a gold natto.

377
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:27,700
Why is gold the only thing I smoke?

378
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:31,700
If you smoke, it's the same as smoking.

379
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:34,700
Natto doesn't harm you if you eat it sitting next to you.

380
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:35,700
Don't be silly.

381
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,700
I'm going to sit next to you.

382
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,700
I'm going to sit next to you a little bit.

383
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,700
Today's cap is sticky.

384
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:45,700
That's not true.

385
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:48,700
I don't care about your body.

386
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:49,700
I don't like it.

387
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:50,700
It's disgusting.

388
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:52,700
I don't care if it's disgusting.

389
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:54,700
Why am I getting angry?

390
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:59,700
Lastly, a girl from Ibaraki Prefecture.

391
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:01,700
I've been thinking a lot lately.

392
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:02,700
Women are not faces.

393
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:07,700
Even if you say it's true, it's unfair that you can only deal with beautiful women.

394
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:09,700
Because the first impression is the face.

395
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,700
The assistants on this show are all beautiful.

396
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:13,700
The ugly ones are useless anyway.

397
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:14,700
The ugly ones are women.

398
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,700
I want to be noticed.

399
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:19,700
Please make a place where girls like me can be active.

400
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:22,700
What kind of place do you want me to do?

401
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:24,700
It doesn't matter if you're ugly.

402
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:27,700
I want you to be on TV as an assistant.

403
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,700
I don't care.

404
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:33,700
You, you, you.

405
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,700
Don't say it over and over again.

406
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:38,700
People who have been watching this show for a long time.

407
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,700
I went home today.

408
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:43,700
Look at all the places where the assistants came out.

409
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:47,700
This guy is completely different depending on his face.

410
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:51,700
If an ugly girl comes out, he can't talk.

411
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:53,700
That's you, isn't it?

412
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,700
That's you, isn't it?

413
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,700
Don't say such a thing.

414
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:58,700
What do you think?

415
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:00,700
It's okay to use it.

416
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:01,700
If you want to do it.

417
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:03,700
What kind of personality and face do you want?

418
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:05,700
I don't know.

419
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,700
What do you mean you don't know?

420
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:08,700
What do you mean you don't know?

421
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,700
I don't know if you're talking.

422
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:13,700
If it's beautiful, it's annoying.

423
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:17,700
If it's beautiful and annoying, I won't talk.

424
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:21,700
The cheeky guy just talks and gets angry.

425
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:25,700
If that's the case, it's a little disappointing, but it's quite interesting.

426
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:27,700
I don't know if it's better to talk or not.

427
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:29,700
For example, you can have fun while drinking.

428
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,700
This guy, Hamada Masatoshi.

429
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:34,700
It's a strategy to increase the number of fans even a little bit.

430
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:36,700
A person.

431
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:38,700
A person is like Momoko with high heels.

432
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,700
I don't know.

433
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:43,700
I'm Momoko.

434
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:47,700
That's what happens when I drink. It doesn't matter if it's beautiful or ugly.

435
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:53,700
But recently, cute girls have a better personality.

436
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:56,700
Ugly girls have a bad personality these days.

437
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:57,700
Really?

438
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:00,700
Cute girls have a bad personality.

439
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:03,700
I think cute girls have a better personality.

440
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:08,700
It's a truth, isn't it?

441
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:11,700
It's like I'm a woman critic.

442
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:14,700
I don't know.

443
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:17,700
I'm like a virgin.

444
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:22,700
I'm like a demon.

445
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:27,700
How many people do you think I've experienced?

446
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:33,700
Well, a hundred is useless.

447
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:35,700
Answer me.

448
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,700
What about me?

449
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:40,700
I'm saying a hundred, but what about Chuck?

450
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,700
How many people do you think I've experienced?

451
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:43,700
I don't know.

452
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:45,700
Don't lie to me.

453
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:49,700
I think I've experienced five people.

454
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:52,700
You must be lying.

455
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,700
Did you see it?

456
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:55,700
You must be lying.

457
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:56,700
Did you see it?

458
00:19:56,700 --> 00:20:01,700
Did you see the scene?

459
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:02,700
That's not true.

460
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,700
Then what about you?

461
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:05,700
What?

462
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:10,700
How many people do you think I've experienced?

463
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:13,700
How many people do I have?

464
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:15,700
You're the only one.

465
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:18,700
How many people do you think I've experienced?

466
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:24,700
I'm not good at imitating women.

467
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:28,700
I love each of them very much.

468
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:31,700
How many people do you think I've experienced?

469
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,700
I'm sorry if I said something wrong.

470
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:36,700
How do you want to express it?

471
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:40,700
A woman you love.

472
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:43,700
That's like a title of a book.

473
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:46,700
How many women have been through your life?

474
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:49,700
You're not a woman, but you've been through it.

475
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:53,700
A woman who has been through my life.

476
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,700
You're crazy.

477
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:56,700
I get it.

478
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:58,700
How many women have been through your life?

479
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:04,700
A woman who has been through my life.

480
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:12,700
How many women have been through my life?

481
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:17,700
Let's go home.

482
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:24,700
I did it alone the other day, so I don't have the right to take a break.

483
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:28,700
I don't have the right to take a break.

484
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:32,700
I don't have the right to take a break.

485
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:35,700
Are you downtown?

486
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:38,700
I'm not downtown.

487
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:40,700
What are you?

488
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:45,700
I'm a human being.

489
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:47,700
Good morning.

490
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:48,700
Did you sleep well today?

491
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:51,700
Yes.

492
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,700
It was cold, wasn't it?

493
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:58,700
This Saturday, February 23rd.

494
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:00,700
I haven't decided on the place yet.

495
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:06,700
I'd like you to make a reservation.

496
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:10,700
I'd like you to meet a young man.

497
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:14,700
Who decided that?

498
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:17,700
I'd like you to meet a young man.

499
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,700
Who do you think is young?

500
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:23,700
A cheap vacancy.

501
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,700
February 23rd.

502
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:28,700
I'd like you to meet a young man.

503
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:31,700
Who do you think is young?

504
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:33,700
Some of them are young!

505
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:35,700
Some of them are not.

506
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:36,700
Both of them.

507
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:40,700
Let's invite an assistant.

508
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:42,700
I'm not playing.

509
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:44,700
Not many.

510
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:52,700
If you want to be an assistant, you have to take a picture with the director, and the rest is all the same, so please take a picture of Akina gradually.

511
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:53,700
I'm waiting for you.

512
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:56,700
So, I'm going to use Akina gradually, so please look forward to next week.

513
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:59,700
Goodbye.

514
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:03,700
I'm going to do my best.

515
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:05,700
It's not an emoji.

516
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:15,700
It's an emoji.
