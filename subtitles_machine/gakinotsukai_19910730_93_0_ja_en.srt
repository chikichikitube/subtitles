1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Which one of you is the popular guy?

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
It's been a while since I've seen this hall.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
But what are you going to do now?

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Are you going to steal a painting?

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Thieves don't dress up like this.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Then what is it? What is it?

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Well, I dressed up like this.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Is that so? That's rare.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Thank you very much.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Let's have an opening today.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Today, I took a survey of everyone at the venue.

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Oh.

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Can you give me a little bit?

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
But this is not something to say now.

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Do you really know that this program has no money?

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I don't want to be a child.

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
But today, let me tell you what kind of survey I took.

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
What kind of guy is the popular guy now?

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm sure both men and women are interested in this.

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
That's right.

21
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
The answers are written here.

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
This is the most popular among all of us.

23
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
There is such a thing.

24
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
What is your hobby?

25
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
My hobby?

26
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
This is it.

27
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
What does this mean?

28
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Is it something to do?

29
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
What is it?

30
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Is it a compliment?

31
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Oh, I got it.

32
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Onani.

33
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Yes.

34
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm sure there are many popular men.

35
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I also play golf.

36
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Is that so?

37
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I'm a golfer.

38
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Is this your opinion?

39
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Yes.

40
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I'm a golfer now.

41
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I also play onani.

42
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
It's okay to write onani.

43
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
The most popular is golf.

44
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Do you play golf or onani?

45
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I play golf and so on.

46
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Let's talk about your strengths.

47
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Well...

48
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
My smile.

49
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Wait a minute.

50
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
No, no.

51
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Does it make you feel bad?

52
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
No, it doesn't make me feel bad.

53
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
My dream is to be in a commercial for Pocky.

54
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Your smile after eating.

55
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
This is my dream.

56
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Is that so?

57
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
My smile.

58
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
My strength is kindness.

59
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
What?

60
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
What kind of kindness?

61
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I'm getting irritated.

62
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
What kind of kindness?

63
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I'm kind to everyone.

64
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I'm kind to you, too.

65
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Is that so?

66
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Why are you staring at me?

67
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I was counting how many times you hit me on the head.

68
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Then I fell asleep.

69
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Don't fall asleep like that.

70
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
You don't have kindness.

71
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Everyone doesn't know that.

72
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Is that so?

73
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
That's right.

74
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
What else do you know?

75
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
This kind of person is popular.

76
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
That's right.

77
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Kindness.

78
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
This is...

79
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I've done a lot of things.

80
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I'm not as angry as a woman who wants to be kind to a man.

81
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Even if I do something bad, she wants me to forgive her.

82
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
It's natural to be hit when you do something bad.

83
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I do that.

84
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
But she wants me to forgive her.

85
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
But she likes men who forgive her.

86
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Is that so?

87
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
That's right.

88
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
That's your girl.

89
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
She's waiting for you.

90
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
That's a bad thing.

91
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
You can break your nose.

92
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
That's right.

93
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I do it to break my nose.

94
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
How about this?

95
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Do I look like a man?

96
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Ladies and gentlemen.

97
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Hello.

98
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Hello.

99
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Hello.

100
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
It's really...

101
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I think this is a strange business.

102
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
This job?

103
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Yes.

104
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
There's no other business that you two are doing together.

105
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Is that so?

106
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
If you think about it.

107
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
That's right.

108
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
That means you two have to get along with each other.

109
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
That's right.

110
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
What I want to say today is...

111
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Why do you say such bad things about me?

112
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
You should say that at the academy.

113
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
It's not like that.

114
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
It's not like that.

115
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
What is it?

116
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
It's the night of the dream red.

117
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Did I say something rude to you on the night of the dream red?

118
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Don't you tell me?

119
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Like a fashion massage or something.

120
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I'm very angry.

121
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
How angry I am?

122
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I'm as angry as when I see the speed limit sign in a traffic jam car.

123
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
If you say something like that, I will...

124
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
You got hit again.

125
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
That's just one of the comments.

126
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
That's right.

127
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Ma-chan, put your shoes on.

128
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
That's...

129
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
You're kind.

130
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
That's what you should never do.

131
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
You should get along with each other.

132
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,000
It's not like I'm angry because you said that.

133
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
If you say something like that, I know a lot of bad things about you.

134
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I know your past that you don't want to be touched.

135
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
What are you talking about?

136
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I've never said that.

137
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
What are you talking about?

138
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I've always said that there are good and bad things on TV.

139
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
People have good and bad things to say.

140
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I know that.

141
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Right?

142
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I know that your father was imprisoned.

143
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
You're saying anything in a different place.

144
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,000
You two are like eyes and ears.

145
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
You're like batteries.

146
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Yes, yes, yes.

147
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Right?

148
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
If you don't get along with each other, you can't win.

149
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
The opponent team.

150
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Baseball.

151
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
You're getting along with each other, aren't you?

152
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
That's why you shouldn't pull people's legs.

153
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
That's all.

154
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
If you say something like that,

155
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:53,000
you'll only get caught.

156
00:06:53,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I made a mistake.

157
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
It's not you.

158
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
That's right.

159
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I'm sorry.

160
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
That's right.

161
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I'm sorry.

162
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I thought you were getting along with each other, too.

163
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
That's right.

164
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
But there's a reason why you shouldn't get along.

165
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
That's right.

166
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
As expected.

167
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
You want to get along with me.

168
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
That's right.

169
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Think about me, too.

170
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Hamada's father wasn't imprisoned?

171
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
That's right.

172
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
That's right.

173
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I think I should get along with you, too.

174
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Hamada...

175
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
That's Mr. Tabata's place.

176
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
That's right.

177
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:46,000
But I can't make a mistake.

178
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Let's get along with each other.

179
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
That's right.

180
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
But you don't have any friends, do you?

181
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
There's something in marriage.

182
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
You get divorced on your honeymoon.

183
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
That's right.

184
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
When you get home.

185
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
You can't stay together forever.

186
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
That's right.

187
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
That's right.

188
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
That's right.

189
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
There's a lot of things that make me angry.

190
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I get angry.

191
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I don't want to be with him forever.

192
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
When I go on a honeymoon, I get angry.

193
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I get angry when I'm told to get out of here.

194
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
That's right.

195
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
When I get married.

196
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
In a different sense, I don't want to get married to a guy like that.

197
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
That's right.

198
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
You're talking about the Narita divorce.

199
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
That's right.

200
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
That's right.

201
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Didn't you both have a hard time until the end?

202
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
That's right.

203
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
When I go out with him, I don't get angry.

204
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
You don't get angry, do you?

205
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
No, I get angry.

206
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
What?

207
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
You get angry?

208
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I get angry.

209
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Since when do you get angry?

210
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
What?

211
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Since when do you get angry?

212
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I've been angry since the beginning.

213
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Oh, you got angry from the beginning?

214
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Is that so?

215
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,000
No, but it's different for men and women who date normally.

216
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
But there are a lot of girls who can't stand it.

217
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
You can't get angry with a girl until you get married.

218
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Is that so?

219
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
That's right.

220
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
But there are times when you get angry on the cover of something.

221
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
That's right.

222
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:39,000
When you don't even have the courage to get angry, you get angry.

223
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
If you do that, I'm sorry, but it's better to get angry.

224
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:48,000
If you get angry when you don't even have the courage to get angry, it's really cool.

225
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
That's true.

226
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
It's not cool even for men.

227
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
If you get angry, you say, I'll do it.

228
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
But girls can't do that.

229
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Do you have a girl you want to get angry with?

230
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
No, I don't.

231
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I don't.

232
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
But if I get angry, I get angry.

233
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I think it's a big deal.

234
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I think so, too.

235
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
But there are times when you don't even have the courage to get angry.

236
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,000
If you get angry, you can't get angry with a girl until you get married.

237
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
You can't get angry when you don't even have the courage to get angry.

238
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
It's the same for me.

239
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,000
When I do something, I can tell if it stinks or not by the smell of my room.

240
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I smell it by the sound and the way it comes out.

241
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I think it stinks, so I look at the face and enjoy it.

242
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
There are times when I speak in a cool way.

243
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I don't get angry with that.

244
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
You don't get angry.

245
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
This kind of man doesn't say it stinks.

246
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
That's true.

247
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
That's like a karaoke man telling me not to get angry.

248
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
That's what I'm saying.

249
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
That's true.

250
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
If you do something, it's not worth it to react to it.

251
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I see.

252
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Where do they usually get angry?

253
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Do they get angry?

254
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Usually?

255
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
They get angry.

256
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Because there are so many people.

257
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
At this moment, someone is definitely angry.

258
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
They definitely get angry.

259
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Is that so?

260
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
That's right.

261
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Japan is such a strange country.

262
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
That's true.

263
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Please take out your papers.

264
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Hello.

265
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Hello.

266
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Are you an amateur today?

267
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Yes.

268
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I see.

269
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Are you angry?

270
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
No, I'm not. I'm just nervous.

271
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
What did you just say?

272
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Work?

273
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Work?

274
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
What do you mean work?

275
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I said work.

276
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,000
It's amazing that an amateur can't speak properly.

277
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
What?

278
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Do you understand?

279
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I was about to ask you.

280
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:02,000
If an amateur can't speak clearly, it's the same as a doctor failing a surgery.

281
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
It's killing you.

282
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
It's killing you.

283
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Why are you repeating it?

284
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I'm listening.

285
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Really.

286
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
How old are you?

287
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
21.

288
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
You're 21.

289
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,000
You should get married.

290
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Do you have a boyfriend?

291
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I have one.

292
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
What?

293
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
What does your boyfriend do?

294
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
He works.

295
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Does he look down on you?

296
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
This is strange.

297
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
My tongue is spinning.

298
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I wanted to ask you.

299
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I wanted to ask if you looked down on me.

300
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Do you look down on me?

301
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Thank you very much.

302
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I'm glad that you look down on me.

303
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Let me introduce her.

304
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Her name is Hiromi Kozaira. She's 23 years old.

305
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I've been watching her since the first episode.

306
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
By the way, there was something like this in the article of FromA on July 16th.

307
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
It was about a late-night show.

308
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
In the article, she was asked what her favorite show was.

309
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
She said she liked Gaki no Tsukai.

310
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
The first place was Kanossa.

311
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
It's over, isn't it?

312
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
It's over.

313
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Now, Gaki is the king of late-night shows.

314
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
It's about Gaki no Tsukai.

315
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
It's written in the introduction.

316
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Downtown is in season now.

317
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Anyway, it's a big explosion.

318
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
It's about to be dangerous.

319
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
What do you mean?

320
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:46,000
A man named Pedro, who is 24 years old, wrote this.

321
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
It's Pedro's opinion, isn't it?

322
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
It's Pedro's opinion.

323
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
But you don't know if it's dangerous, do you?

324
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Is that so?

325
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
That's right.

326
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I don't know what's going to happen tomorrow.

327
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I really don't know what's going to happen in this entertainment world.

328
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I know what's going to happen.

329
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I don't know what's going to happen.

330
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I don't know what's going to happen.

331
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I'm going to join the late-night show.

332
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
What?

333
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
What?

334
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I'm telling you.

335
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
You're not telling me.

336
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I'm telling you.

337
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
You're not telling me.

338
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Your ears are weird.

339
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Your ears are weird.

340
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Did you find out?

341
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I told you I was going to join the late-night show.

342
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
If you want to know more about the late-night show, please send it to the address below.

343
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
If you want to join the late-night show, please send it to the address below.

344
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Tokyo, Shibuya, 1-1-4.

345
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Aoyama, Flowerville, 5th floor.

346
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
The late-night show in Japan.

347
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
If you send it this far, you can join the late-night show.

348
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Do you want to join us?

349
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
No.

350
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,000
You don't know how many benefits you'll get if you join the late-night show.

351
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
What are the benefits?

352
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
If I hear that, I'll join the show again.

353
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
The late-night show key holder.

354
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
If you become a member, you'll get all the benefits.

355
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
It's shaped like a bird.

356
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
It's shaped like a key holder.

357
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
And then?

358
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
And then?

359
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
The late-night show ballpoint pen.

360
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
What is this?

361
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I don't know.

362
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
The late-night show ballpoint pen.

363
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
The late-night show ballpoint pen.

364
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
If you become a late-night show, you'll get a ballpoint pen.

365
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
What?

366
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
If you become a late-night show, you'll get a ballpoint pen.

367
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:35,000
If you become a late-night show, you'll get a ballpoint pen.

368
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,000
You're not allowed to say such things in the late-night show.

369
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Well...

370
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Read it yourself.

371
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I'll help you.

372
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
What is this?

373
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Read it, Aomodara.

374
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
What is this?

375
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Don't look down on me.

376
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Good evening.

377
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I'm a friend of Masumoto-san's cousin's wife's cousin.

378
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
What?

379
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:10,000
That's why we have a little connection.

380
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I may bother you at some point, but please take care of me at that time.

381
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,000
His cousin is probably...

382
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Makoto?

383
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Liar!

384
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Wasn't it Makoto?

385
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I don't know.

386
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
His wife?

387
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I was told that it wasn't Makoto.

388
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Yoshie-san's cousin's...

389
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Satake-san's...

390
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
That's enough!

391
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Kuwabara-san's...

392
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Liar!

393
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
This one.

394
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
How to go home.

395
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
The ending.

396
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I've thought of a way to go home.

397
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:58,000
How about Parma No. 2 dressed up as Booby and come out to save them and leave?

398
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
That person...

399
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
If you dress like that, you'll really look like him.

400
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I'll try.

401
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I'll try to come out in Booby next week.

402
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

403
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,000
It's the black screen of the Prime Minister.

404
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

405
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:28,000
The other day, I was sitting in the toilet next to Kiyosu-kun at Shinjuku Station with my friend.

406
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Then an aunt came out of Kiyosu-kun.

407
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I was wondering what to do, and when I looked at her, she suddenly took out a trash can.

408
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
And she took out some magazines from them and read them out.

409
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:46,000
After that, I took out a couple of new, clean-looking weekly magazines.

410
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:52,000
And I put them on top of the magazine I was selling at Kiyosu-kun.

411
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,000
And I saw an old man buying the magazine from the trash can.

412
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I couldn't stop crying.

413
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
You're lying!

414
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Have you been crying all this time?

415
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
No, I haven't.

416
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I don't know.

417
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:14,000
There's a thing called a manga spirit.

418
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Oh, the last word of the day is a manga spirit.

419
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
There's a thing called a manga spirit.

420
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I'll put this in the book and ask.

421
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
A manga spirit?

422
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
A manga spirit.

423
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,000
There's a thing called a manga spirit in the book you bought.

424
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
And after reading it...

425
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
There's a manga spirit in all the manga.

426
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
There's a manga spirit.

427
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
You're reading it, aren't you?

428
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
What's the manga spirit doing during that time?

429
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
There's a manga spirit when I open it.

430
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
There's a manga spirit when you open it?

431
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Yes, there is.

432
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
And then?

433
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:55,000
When I turn the page, the manga spirit runs like this.

434
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
The manga spirit has to be on every page.

435
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
That's why it runs.

436
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
In the middle...

437
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Oh, it's a station.

438
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
What's the manga spirit doing during that time?

439
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I see.

440
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,000
When I read the next page, the manga spirit opens.

441
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I see.

442
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
You're annoying.

443
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
The manga spirit is scary.

444
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Shut up.

445
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,000
There was a girl called Aiko Gibo.

446
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I don't know.

447
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
She's an amazing...

448
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Old lady.

449
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I know her.

450
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
She's Haguki Bon.

451
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Yes.

452
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Haguki Bon.

453
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:37,000
There was a younger brother who passed away.

454
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
She was crying.

455
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Yes.

456
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
She's amazing.

457
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Haguki Bon.

458
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I want you to see Haguki Bon.

459
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Why?

460
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Watanabe of Akashin-Go saw it and said,

461
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I'll tell you later.

462
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Right?

463
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
That kind of person...

464
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
He said, what are you doing here?

465
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
He said, hey, hey, hey.

466
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I asked him later.

467
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
He said, there's a manga spirit behind you.

468
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
What do you say?

469
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
He didn't die.

470
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,000
You did something terrible to a woman and broke up.

471
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
The manga spirit of that person is behind you.

472
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I think you'll definitely be told.

473
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,000
The manga spirit is annoying.

474
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Call him next time, Gibo-san.

475
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
If I tell him...

476
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
The manga spirit is behind you.

477
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,000
The manga spirit!

478
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
You're an old lady.

479
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
I admit that she's Haguki Bon.

480
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
But she's not an old lady.

481
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
You should call her sensei.

482
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:48,000
The one behind that sensei is Haguki-chan.

483
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:58,000
I don't know her!

484
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
If you have a chance next time, please do it.

485
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,000
It's good, isn't it?

486
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Is that all?

487
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Yes, that's all.

488
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
I have to go home.

489
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
I have to clean this up.

490
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
So, what do you want to do?

491
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
I want you to stand here today.

492
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,000
I'm going to leave in a cool way today.

493
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Like a Kabuki actor.

494
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Really.

495
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Is that okay?

496
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Yes.

497
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Everyone, please come again.

498
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Goodbye.

499
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:49,000
It seems like it's going up and down from the back.

500
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Up and down.

501
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Amazing.

502
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:14,000
That's all?

503
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Good evening.

504
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
I'm the editor.

505
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Yes.

506
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:22,000
So, this week, we went down and came back.

507
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Next week, they'll come to help us.

508
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Is that decided?

509
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Yes, it's decided.

510
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:35,000
No. 2 will come to help us.

511
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:40,000
We'll ask No. 2 to help us.

512
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
I thought about it today.

513
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Tsu-chi looks like No. 4, doesn't he?

514
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
He's a pa, isn't he?

515
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:57,000
So, we'll ask No. 2 and No. 4 to help us.

516
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
So, we'll ask No. 2 and No. 4 to help us.

517
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
No. 2 will come to help us.

518
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Please look forward to the next season's ending.

519
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
And, we'll use the postcards.

520
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,000
100th anniversary.

521
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
I see.

522
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
It's already here.

523
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
But, we don't have this yet.

524
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
You don't have it?

525
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Yes.

526
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Let's ask for it.

527
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
That's it.

528
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
We'll use the postcards until the next season.

529
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Bye.

530
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Thank you.

531
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
That's good.

532
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Let's ask for it.

533
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Are you happy?
