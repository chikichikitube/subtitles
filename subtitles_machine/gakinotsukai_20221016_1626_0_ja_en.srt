00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Tonight's Gaki no Tsukai will be played with the original game of Gainin Kouan!

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
The second half!

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
The original game that I thought of will be chosen!

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Gaki no Tsukai

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Let's go! Gainin-san, please!

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Hello!

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
My name is Newton Ito!

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Newton Ito?

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Akita-chan!

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
It will definitely sell!

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Thank you very much!

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I don't know how to say it.

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Newton Ito Kouan Game Tour with high tension gag!

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I've been doing it for 25 years.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I've been doing it a lot.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I've done too many games, but I've done it all.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I thought it would be nice to combine two simple games.

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
It's weird if you say it's a gold medal.

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
But it's weird if you say it's a gold medal.

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I've been doing it for a long time, so I'm getting used to it.

21
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I want you to be more excited.

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I see.

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
So, rather than a new game, I combined two existing ones.

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
That's exactly right.

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Here's the game I brought today.

26
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Hit it, wear it, look over there.

27
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
It's a board game.

28
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
You know both, right?

29
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I tried to mix it.

30
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
First of all, hit it, wear it, look over there, and rock-paper-scissors.

31
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
If you win by rock-paper-scissors, look over there and do it.

32
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
If you look in the same direction as the basket, you get one point.

33
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Up to this point, it's almost the same as the usual rules.

34
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Look over there and do it in four directions.

35
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
It's a 75% chance that you can avoid it.

36
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Then you can get a hammer chance by avoiding it.

37
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
If you hit it before you guard it, you'll get one point.

38
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
If you guard it, it's no count.

39
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
If you get three points, you'll be the winner.

40
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
If you ask me, I don't know.

41
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
It's supposed to be simple.

42
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
You have to try it.

43
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
You have to try it.

44
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I've fought a lot of young people before, but I've never lost.

45
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Really?

46
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I've won all of them.

47
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
It would be amazing if someone won today.

48
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
So I thought I'd get rid of five people.

49
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
That's good.

50
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Five people will challenge MUTON Ito, who has never lost before.

51
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Who will go first?

52
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
MUTON will decide.

53
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
First of all, Mr. Endo.

54
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I'm really good at hitting and guarding.

55
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
That's why I want to beat Mr. Endo as soon as possible.

56
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I see.

57
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I'm ready.

58
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I'm ready.

59
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
One, two.

60
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Hit and guard. Look over there.

61
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Look over there.

62
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
One, two.

63
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Hit and guard. Look over there.

64
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Look over there.

65
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
What's that?

66
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Endo?

67
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
What's going on?

68
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
What's wrong with you?

69
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Don't run away from Mr. Takeshi.

70
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Don't deceive me.

71
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
But isn't this one point?

72
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
It's still one point.

73
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I got this point.

74
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
One, two.

75
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Hit and guard. Look over there.

76
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Look over there.

77
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
One, two.

78
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Hit and guard. Look over there.

79
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Look over there.

80
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I see. I get it.

81
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
One, two.

82
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Hit and guard. Look over there.

83
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Look over there.

84
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I lost.

85
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Now it's two against one.

86
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
One, two.

87
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Hit and guard. Look over there.

88
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Look over there.

89
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
One, two.

90
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Hit and guard. Look over there.

91
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
One, two.

92
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
What?

93
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
That was great.

94
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Why are you standing still?

95
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Why?

96
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I thought I was going to lose.

97
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I felt it in slow motion.

98
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
It's hard.

99
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
It's hard.

100
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I was stuck.

101
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I'll explain it.

102
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I'll do it in fighter mode.

103
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Get ready.

104
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I'm ready.

105
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I'm ready.

106
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
One, two.

107
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Hit and guard. Look over there.

108
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Look over there.

109
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I got it.

110
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
This may be difficult.

111
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I see.

112
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Who's next?

113
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Mr. Hosei.

114
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Please.

115
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Look over there.

116
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I thought I was going to lose.

117
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I had to defend right away.

118
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
That's right.

119
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
It changes from defense to attack.

120
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
That's right.

121
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
It's interesting.

122
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
It's interesting.

123
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
One, two.

124
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Hit and guard. Look over there.

125
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Look over there.

126
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I'm sorry.

127
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
That's a lie.

128
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
You were already in the way.

129
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
You were already in the way.

130
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I can't do this.

131
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
This is downtown.

132
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I was already in the way.

133
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
You were already in the way.

134
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I was just in the way.

135
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I was surprised.

136
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
One, two.

137
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Hit and guard. Look over there.

138
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Look over there.

139
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Look over here.

140
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Look over here.

141
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Look over here.

142
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Look over here.

143
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Look over there.

144
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I lost.

145
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
What is this guy?

146
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Leave me alone.

147
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
The drawer is empty.

148
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Leave me alone.

149
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Hit and guard. Look over there.

150
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
You are a weak person.

151
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Please cover me.

152
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
At least take off your helmet.

153
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I definitely will.

154
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I definitely will.

155
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
At least take off your helmet.

156
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Please cover me.

157
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Next is the challenge of TANAKA.

158
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Look over there.

159
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
He lost.

160
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
MUTO and ITO of the three consecutive wins.

161
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
MUTO and ITO of the three consecutive wins.

162
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I will not lose.

163
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I will not lose.

164
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
If I win here, I won't have to do Hamada anymore.

165
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Let's decide.

166
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
It's okay when you lose.

167
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Please decide.

168
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Thank you.

169
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Hit and guard. Look over there.

170
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Hit and guard. Look over there.

171
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I lost.

172
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I lost.

173
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Hit and guard. Look over there.

174
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Didn't you say hit and guard?

175
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
That's right.

176
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
You don't have to say it.

177
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I just didn't say it to you.

178
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
You don't get points.

179
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I don't get points.

180
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
It's a waste.

181
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Hit and guard. Look over there.

182
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Hit and guard. Look over there.

183
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I lost.

184
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Hit and guard. Look over there.

185
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Hit and guard. Look over there.

186
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I lost.

187
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,000
1 to 1

188
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Hit and guard. Look over there.

189
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I lost.

190
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Hit and guard. Look over there.

191
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I lost.

192
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
It's over.

193
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
It's over.

194
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I've been playing rock-paper-scissors for a long time.

195
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
The last challenger of the Gaki team is Tomo.

196
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Please take a picture of me.

197
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
This is like a beautiful picture.

198
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
A beautiful picture.

199
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
One, two, three.

200
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Look over there.

201
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Look over there.

202
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I lost to the simple one.

203
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I lost to the simple one.

204
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
First of all, I want to give you a break.

205
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I thought it was the easiest one.

206
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
One, two, three.

207
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Look over there.

208
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Look over there.

209
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
The reaction is a little different.

210
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Look over there.

211
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Look over there.

212
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
The opponent is scared.

213
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
In a different sense.

214
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Please do your best.

215
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Save it.

216
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Save it as much as you can.

217
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
It went in beautifully.

218
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
You are strong.

219
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I don't think I can win.

220
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
2-1?

221
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I will only support the MET.

222
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Someone will support the MET.

223
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
In downtown.

224
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
In downtown.

225
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Matsumoto will support the MET.

226
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I will support the MET.

227
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I support the MET in MUTON.

228
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I support the MET in MUTON.

229
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
You can put it here.

230
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
If Matsumoto takes it.

231
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
If Matsumoto takes it, it's over.

232
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I support the MET in this position.

233
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
That's right.

234
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
This is a little.

235
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
This is the first time.

236
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I don't know what will happen.

237
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
One, two, three.

238
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Look over there.

239
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Look over there.

240
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
What is this?

241
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
You lost.

242
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
You lost.

243
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Thank you.

244
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Thank you.

245
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
The next entertainer, please.

246
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Hello.

247
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
You are a man and a woman.

248
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I'm Tan-chan.

249
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I'm BIN-TAN-PAN.

250
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Nice to meet you.

251
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Thank you.

252
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
How many years has it been?

253
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
It's been half a year since the combination was formed.

254
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
It's about that much.

255
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
If you look at my work history,

256
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
This is Tan-chan, the 8th year.

257
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I'm 15 years old.

258
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
We're 7 years apart.

259
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
It's strange.

260
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
BIN-TAN-PAN's game tour.

261
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Every month,

262
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I always play an original game.

263
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I'm doing a live show.

264
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I'm going to play this original game.

265
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I'm doing it to get out.

266
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I brought the one that was the fastest today.

267
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Here it is.

268
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Let's match the words.

269
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
The rules are simple.

270
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
First of all, I will put out one kanji of the topic.

271
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
You can put it in front of the kanji, in the back, in the front and in the back.

272
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Please add one kanji and make two-letter words.

273
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
When you're done, put it out.

274
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
If you match the kanji in the same way, it's a success.

275
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I expect everyone to write something.

276
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
That's right.

277
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
If you have a chance, try it.

278
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I'll do it.

279
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Thank you very much.

280
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I'll do it.

281
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Do you do it with just five people?

282
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I'll give you a topic.

283
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Plus Tan-chan.

284
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I don't know what Tan-chan is thinking.

285
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
If it was Tan-chan, it would be easy.

286
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Let's match the words.

287
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
The first kanji is here.

288
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
It's I.

289
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
You can put I in the back or in the front.

290
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Please make two-letter words.

291
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Let's match it with everyone.

292
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
It would be great if this was the first time.

293
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I think it's a good match.

294
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Really?

295
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Are you ready?

296
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Let's open it together.

297
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Please open your answers together.

298
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Netsuai, aijou, renai, aijou, renai, aijin.

299
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Aijin.

300
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
It's definitely strange.

301
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I can't write it.

302
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I can't write it at all.

303
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Why did Amada come out on purpose?

304
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
That's not it.

305
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
It's strange.

306
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I can write it.

307
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
It's amazing.

308
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
It's difficult.

309
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
The next topic is here.

310
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Hito.

311
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
It's Hito.

312
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Of course.

313
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
You can write what you think.

314
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
That's right.

315
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I don't know.

316
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
What should I do?

317
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I think everyone will write this.

318
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I can't trust Tanaka.

319
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
It's simple.

320
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Let's match it.

321
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Let's match it.

322
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Wait a minute.

323
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Let's open it one by one.

324
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
HOSEI.

325
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Please open it.

326
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Jinko.

327
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Jinko.

328
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Did you match it?

329
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
What is Jinko?

330
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Our reactions are different.

331
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
It's completely different.

332
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I didn't expect it to be so different.

333
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
What is it?

334
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Please open it together.

335
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Please open it together.

336
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
amazing.

337
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
It's a human being.

338
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
It's a human being.

339
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
But it's the same.

340
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
It's the same.

341
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
It's a human being.

342
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
It's a human being.

343
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
It's a human being.

344
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
It's a human being.

345
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Next, let's look at Tanaka.

346
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Please look at Tanaka.

347
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Carrot.

348
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
It's a carrot.

349
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Do you have a vegetable here?

350
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Do you have a vegetable here?

351
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Carrot.

352
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Is it okay, Matsumoto?

353
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I'm sad.

354
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
This is definitely the answer.

355
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
What is it?

356
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I thought everyone would be right.

357
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I thought everyone would be right.

358
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
It wasn't.

359
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I'm sorry.

360
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
How many years have you been doing this?

361
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I'm sorry.

362
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
This is a service problem.

363
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
This depends on Hamada.

364
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
That's right.

365
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
It's the same.

366
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
That's right.

367
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Hamada, please.

368
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
amazing.

369
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
This is amazing.

370
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I almost cried.

371
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I almost cried.

372
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
If you're about to cry, write it down.

373
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Next actor, please.

374
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
It's okay.

375
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Nice to meet you.

376
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
It's a greeting of a guy who eats with his parents' money.

377

00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I want you to do your best.

380
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
What is the next game?

381
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
What is the next game?

382
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
What is the next game?

383
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
This is the game we brought.

384
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
This is a word game.

385
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
This is a word game.

386
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I want everyone to play this.

387
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Please explain the rules.

388
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
This game is.

00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
If it's an animal's name,

394
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
look for it.

395
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
For example, let's make a chicken.

396
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
If you make a lot of characters,

397
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
that's enough.

398
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
It's better to make two more than a cat.

399
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
It's fine if not two characters.

400
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
But it takes some time to find it.

401
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I'm gonna put in half,

402
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
but I want you to put it in.

403
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Oh, you don't have a horizontal bar.

404
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
This is okay.

405
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,520
Pick the

00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:25,520
The person with the highest number of letters wins.

408
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,520
I will announce the topic.

409
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:30,520

You can wear it.

411
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,520
What are the characteristics of glasses?

412
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:38,520
You are a talent who stands out with glasses.

413
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,520
I can't see.

414
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:42,520
I'm sorry.

I don't know anymore.

Please return all of this.

Thank you very much.

430
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,520
Kombu.

431
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,520
Do you want me to complete it with kombu?

432
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:24,520
You don't look at me at all.

433
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,520
I can't see it at all.

HOSE is fast.

440

What is the answer?

441
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,520

Wait a minute.

Hamada is fast.

461

There is a small 2.

466
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,520
No.

467
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,520
I'm looking for it in ice hockey.

This is not soccer.

483
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:17,520

What are you trying to make, Tanaka-san?

548
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:57,520
I'm going to make a big bike.

549
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,520
That's a long word.

550
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,520
You're challenging me.

551
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,520
Matsuno-san?

552
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,520
I'm going to make a pigeon.

He was riding a pigeon.

554
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,520
A pigeon with a pigeon's chest.

555
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:13,520
I'm going to make a pigeon bus.

556
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,520
A pigeon bus is cool.

557
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:18,520
I've never thought it was cool.

558
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:22,520
It's reversed.

559
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:26,520
By the way, this is the last one.

560
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:31,520
Here's the last topic.

561
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,520

Let's start.

563
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,520
This is hard.

564
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:41,520
I think it's going to take a long time.

565
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,520
If you have this, you can reverse it.

566
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,520
Combination name.

567
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,520
It's reversed.

568
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,520
How is it?

569
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:52,520
Hamada-san has a lot of cards.

570
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,520
I want luck.

571
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:57,520
Give it to me.

572
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,520
Did you get it?

573
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,520
I got it.

574
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,520
Hamada-san.

575
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:06,520
Not yet.

576
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,520
I got it.

577
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:12,520
Hamada-san, please answer.

578
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:15,520
I want St. Louis.

579
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:18,520
If you show me the card.

580
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:20,520
It's cool and long.

581
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:21,520
OK?

582
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:26,520
I want St. Louis.

583
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:31,520
That means 8 points.

584
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,520
I want it.

585
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,520
That's great.

586
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,520
That's great.

587
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:43,520
Hamada-san won with a total of 15 points.

588
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:46,520
Thank you very much.

589
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:48,520
What is this?

590
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:51,520
I was going to make Yasushi Kiyoshi.

591
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:54,520
This is Hei, but it's okay.

592
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:56,520
It's not Hei.

593
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:59,520
It's Helen.

594
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,520
You deceived me.

595
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:04,520
I'm sorry.

596
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:07,520
