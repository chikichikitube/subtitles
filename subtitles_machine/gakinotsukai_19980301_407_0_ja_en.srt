1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I caught a cold.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I'm on a preventive shot.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
You're lying.

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
You really do things like that...

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
on your own, don't you?

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Hamada will collapse from the cold.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Hamada's sick project.

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
A special to show the back of the back of Gaki no Tsukai.

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
A special to show the back of the back of Gaki no Tsukai.

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
A special to show the back of the back of Gaki no Tsukai.

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
The program will start.

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
On January 8th, Gaki no Tsukai will be broadcasted over 400 times.

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Around downtown Gaki no Tsukai.

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Up until now, there have been a number of special projects,

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
and personal projects,

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
that have created projects that remain in the memory, even if they don't remain in the memory.

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
The number has exceeded 40 in just one year.

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
However, this program seems to show the back of the back of the back of Gaki no Tsukai.

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
In reality, the real back of the back of the back of Gaki no Tsukai has not been shown.

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Therefore, this time, from the front to the back of Gaki no Tsukai,

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
everything will be revealed.

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Up until now, it has been shown to anyone, anywhere.

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Starting with downtown,

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Yamasaki, Horikohoka, Kisei-chan's true face,

25
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
and the backstage during the actual recording, etc.

26
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The first reveal of this program, the return of the fans.

27
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
We will present you a new special,

28
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
which will be a combination of a pre-released VTR.

29
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
This program is brought to you by the sponsors you see.

30
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
First, the appearance of the stars.

31
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
This project is to invite a big guest to Gaki.

32
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Rather than inviting a big guest,

33
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
it is better to invite someone who is good at it.

34
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
The person who is assigned to call the stars from downtown,

35
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
has to become that star and appear.

36
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
For the person who is assigned,

37
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
the time to make the role is short,

38
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
and he panics.

39
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:19,000
As a result of his panicking, he is asked to evolve.

40
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Isn't it good to have Hiroko Yakushima?

41
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
That would be great.

42
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I've never seen him.

43
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I saw him earlier.

44
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Go and invite him.

45
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
He was on the show.

46
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Really?

47
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Is he a comedian?

48
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Why is he a comedian?

49
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
He is a comedian.

50
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
This is the first time.

51
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Hiroko Yakushima is the best.

52
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I couldn't stop at the first time.

53
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I don't know what will happen at the first time.

54
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I don't know the atmosphere.

55
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
The atmosphere is strange.

56
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:19,000
The atmosphere is different.

57
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:48,000
He is here.

58
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Are you in a sailor suit?

59
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
If you don't mind, I'd like you to come out.

60
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:02,000
What is it?

61
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Is it okay?

62
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Hiroko Yakushima.

63
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Can I go home?

64
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
What is it?

65
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I'm sorry.

66
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I'm in a hurry.

67
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I'm going home in a hurry.

68
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Please take care of him.

69
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
This is Inoki's video.

70
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
This is Inoki's video.

71
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I saw this video.

72
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
This is Suwa.

73
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,000
This is Inoki.

74
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I don't think Inoki is here.

75
00:04:52,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I'm looking for him, but I'm sorry if he's not here.

76
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I don't know what will happen at the first time.

77
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I don't know what will happen at the first time.

78
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I'm scared.

79
00:05:51,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I'm sorry.

80
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I'm sorry.

81
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I'd like you to come out this time.

82
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,000
One, two, three.

83
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I'm scared.

84
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I'm scared.

85
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Are you called Shimura?

86
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Takasu.

87
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I'm an otaku.

88
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I'd like you to come out this time.

89
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I'm scared.

90
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I'm scared.

91
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I'm scared.

92
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I'm scared.

93
00:06:50,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I'm scared.

94
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I'm scared.

95
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I'm scared.

96
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I'm scared.

97
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Good morning.

98
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I'm Shimura.

99
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
What?

100
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
What?

101
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
What?

102
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
What?

103
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:42,000
What?

104
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Did you find Ako-san?

105
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Is it really Ako-san?

106
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,000
It's been a long time.

107
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:59,000
That's just like Matsumoto and me.

108
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:10,000
If it's Ako-san, tell us earlier.

109
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Matsumoto is going to do it?

110
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Akko-san

111
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Is there a place to hold it?

112
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Yes, there is

113
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Akko-san

114
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
My story is already over

115
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
What do you mean?

116
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
What should I do?

117
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
What kind of make-up?

118
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
What kind of make-up?

119
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I don't have any weapon

120
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Really?

121
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Yes

122
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
It's okay

123
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Akko-san, what are you doing?

124
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I don't have any weapon

125
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I want you to appear on the show

126
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I don't have any weapon

127
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I don't have any weapon

128
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
It's okay

129
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
It's okay

130
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
It's okay

131
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
It's okay

132
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
It's okay

133
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
It's okay

134
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
It's okay

135
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
And for the first time

136
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Kokoriko Endo is playing the role of this star

137
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Nijikawa-kun

138
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Nijikawa-kun

139
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Nijikawa-kun

140
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I didn't do it

141
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I didn't do it

142
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:34,000
And for the second time, Kokoriko Tanaka is playing the role of this star

143
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I want you to appear on the show

144
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I don't have any weapon

145
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I don't have any weapon

146
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I don't have any weapon

147
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Wajima-san

148
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Wajima-san

149
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:14,000
For the first time, let's make a calendar with all the staff members

150
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,000
And for the second time, we made a calendar with all the staff members

151
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,000
And for the second time, we made a calendar with all the staff members

152
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:32,000
And for the second time, we made a calendar with all the staff members

153
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Today, we have Mr. Yamazaki

154
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Hello

155
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Please

156
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
What are your plans for next year?

157
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Next year, I want to do my best

158
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
For example?

159
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Something like this

160
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
For work?

161
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
It's a long story

162
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I want to play the piano

163
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Please tell me the truth

164
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I'm not lying

165
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I'm not lying

166
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I'm joking

167
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Please don't tell a lie

168
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I want to play the tofu

169
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Please don't tell a lie

170
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I want to play the tofu

171
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Please don't tell a lie

172
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I can only think of it as a joke.

173
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Why?

174
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Because I don't fly that much.

175
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Today, we have Mr. Oitoshi Matsumoto.

176
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Hello, hello, hello.

177
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Welcome.

178
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
No, no, no.

179
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
It's been 98 years since the war.

180
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
That's right.

181
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
How many years until the 21st century?

182
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
That's right. 4 years?

183
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
It's been 4 years.

184
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
It's been 4 years.

185
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
When are you going to talk about it?

186
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
2 more years.

187
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
It's kind of hard.

188
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
What are your aspirations for next year?

189
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
My aspirations for next year?

190
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I want to do a lot of things that will wipe out the world.

191
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I see.

192
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
That's a good thing.

193
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Yes.

194
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Wipe out the world and wipe out the world.

195
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I want to wipe out the world and wipe out the world.

196
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
You're going to wipe out the world and wipe out the world?

197
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I don't want to be surprised.

198
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I don't want to be surprised.

199
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I don't care what you think.

200
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
It's hard.

201
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
You have to tell me.

202
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Do you want me to tell you?

203
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
You have to tell me.

204
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
You have to tell me.

205
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
You have to tell me.

206
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
You have to tell me.

207
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
You have to tell me.

208
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
You have to tell me.

209
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Talk, talk.

210
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
How do you say it?

211
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Laugh?

212
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
That's a good thing.

213
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I want to hear more of that.

214
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
For you, Yamazaki,

215
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Laugh?

216
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Laugh?

217
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Yes.

218
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
What is that?

219
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
It's a misalignment of the composition.

220
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
A misalignment of the composition?

221
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
It's a little easier to understand.

222
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I think you can do it, too.

223
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
A misalignment of the composition?

224
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
It's going to fall.

225
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Oh, really?

226
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
What do you mean by a misalignment of the composition?

227
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
A misalignment of the composition?

228
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Yes.

229
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I think I sold this.

230
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Yes, yes, yes.

231
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Thank you.

232
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Thank you.

233
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Thank you.

234
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Thank you.

235
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Thank you.

236
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Good luck on the second round.

237
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Good luck on the second round.

238
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I'm going to talk to Yamazaki again.

239
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Is this it?

240
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
It's a big deal.

241
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
It's a big deal.

242
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
It's a big deal.

243
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Five seconds before.

244
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Yes.

245
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Five, four, three, two.

246
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Hello.

247
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Today, too.

248
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
It's a friendly atmosphere.

249
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Today.

250
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I'm here.

251
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Today's guest is Hama-chan.

252
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Hello.

253
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Good evening.

254
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
What's wrong?

255
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
What is it?

256
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
You're very excited.

257
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I'm usually like this.

258
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
No, it's not.

259
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
You're usually very cheerful.

260
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Oh, really?

261
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
You're not on TV.

262
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I'm usually like this.

263
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,000
How do you usually feel?

264
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
You're cheerful, so don't say it first.

265
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I'm calling a lot of guests because it's a talk show.

266
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
First, Sudo-kun came back.

267
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
The second time was Tanaka Kokoriko.

268
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
It's the third time today.

269
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
It's the 21st century.

270
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
How many years do we have left?

271
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Two years?

272
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:45,000
It's been two years, so I'm wondering how I'm going to do it.

273
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
The frame is very wide.

274
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
How was it?

275
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Are you trying to do it again?

276
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
No, no, no.

277
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
If you don't have a story, don't talk to people.

278
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
That's right.

279
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
But we learned how to talk.

280
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
As expected, raw things are good.

281
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
It's a little different from TV.

282
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:14,000
We're going to do it together.

283
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I had a lot of fun.

284
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I look forward to it again.

285
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Please let me study more.

286
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Thank you very much.

287
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Thank you very much.

288
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
It's cold.

289
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
It's cold.

290
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
It's not good.

291
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
It's not good.

292
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:37,000
The 9th Gagirochikai Alliance's New Year's New Year's Party.

293
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Everyone is in a good mood after drinking.

294
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,000
There was such a conversation between Machan and Hama-chan that I rarely see.

295
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
What are you doing?

296
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I'll drink it.

297
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Why?

298
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I'll drink it.

299
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I'll drink it.

300
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I'll drink it.

301
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:00,000
After such a party mood, the downtown was decided as a new comedy combination at 9 o'clock.

302
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Before the performance, he had never shown his expression on the stage.

303
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:11,000
The first is Hamada and O-numa.

304
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
It's coming.

305
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
It's coming.

306
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Why don't you drink it?

307
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Why don't you drink it?

308
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Why don't you drink it?

309
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:32,000
It's complicated.

310
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I don't want you to drink it.

311
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I don't want you to drink it.

312
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I'm a bird.

313
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I don't want you to drink it.

314
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:56,000
We were the most naked.

315
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
It's hot.

316
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,000
It's not easy to be caught and caught.

317
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
It's hot.

318
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
You did a good job.

319
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Thank you for your hard work.

320
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
You did a good job.

321
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Thank you for your hard work.

322
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
It was good.

323
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
It's hard to be caught.

324
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
It's easy to be caught.

325
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
It's easy to be caught.

326
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
It's easy to be caught.

327
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I can't be caught.

328
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
What is the relationship between that and that?

329
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
It's amazing.

330
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I'm not nervous.

331
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
What is this?

332
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I'm not confident.

333
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I'm not confident.

334
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Thank you very much.

335
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:52,000
It's over.

336
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I'm sorry.

337
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
It's the last one.

338
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
It's finally the last one.

339
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
We've seen a lot of four teams so far.

340
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
The first team, the second team, and the third team were very good.

341
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I don't know if the fourth team will win.

342
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
The last team is...

343
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Matsumoto and Irie.

344
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Hello, I'm Matsumoto.

345
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I'm Irie.

346
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
We are Hammers.

347
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I'll hit you.

348
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,000
You're a weird guy.

349
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
You're a weird guy.

350
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Stop it.

351
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
It's over.

352
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
It's too early.

353
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:54,000
I'm nervous.

354
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I've always wanted to come and see it.

355
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I'm very satisfied.

356
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
It was fun.

357
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:12,000
It was very interesting to see the real comedy.

358
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I hope you'll be in a powerful downtown.

359
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
It was fun.

360
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I've loved it since I was a kid.

361
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I've always been able to see it.

362
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
It was really fun to see it live today.

363
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:29,000
If you'd like to come again, please come to the game.

364
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,000
The downtown of Hong Kong, which belongs to Yoshimoto Industries.

365
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,000
The downtown is full of bad guys working against the junior Horiko.

366
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Horiko's wish is to send this man back to Osaka.

367
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
I'm going to send him back.

368
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
You're going to send him back?

369
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
I'm going to send him back to Osaka.

370
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
He quickly entered the school building in Hong Kong.

371
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Everyone in Hong Kong was in a hurry.

372
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
What are you doing?

373
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Put it in your mouth.

374
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
It's hard.

375
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:13,000
He loaded the cardboard box in Hong Kong into the truck and sent it to Osaka.

376
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I was the only one who could say that.

377
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
When I got out of the car, the staff said,

378
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Thank you for your hard work.

379
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
I couldn't say anything.

380
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
But let's go to NGK.

381
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
I'm a little worried right now.

382
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Are you serious?

383
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:37,000
What happened in Hong Kong after the recording?

384
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Stop it.

385
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
I'm going to Osaka for a while.

386
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
I hate you.

387
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Thank you for your hard work.

388
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
I'm sorry.

389
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
What happened to your mouth?

390
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
I was thinking,

391
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,000
I'm addicted to the chopper in Hong Kong.

392
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
It was cut like this.

393
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Where is it cut?

394
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
It's okay.

395
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
You did it yourself.

396
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
It's disgusting.

397
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
You put it in the cardboard box and cut it yourself.

398
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
I can't do that.

399
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
That's funny.

400
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
I can't do it anymore.

401
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
You can't do it alone.

402
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
I was really scared.

403
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
I can't take it with me.

404
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
It's about the two of us.

405
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
I can't do it.

406
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
As a student.

407
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
And when I do that,

408
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
I can't turn the camera.

409
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
I was going to quit on the way.

410
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Because it hurts.

411
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I really can't do it.

412
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
I'm a general sense.

413
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
I'm a general sense.

414
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
I'm going to hit 50.

415
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
You can't hit it.

416
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Because it's a closed-door beach.

417
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,000
50 people will receive a calendar.

418
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:50,000
The prize money will be given to the winner.

419
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Everyone, please apply.

420
00:23:53,000 --> 00:24:19,000
