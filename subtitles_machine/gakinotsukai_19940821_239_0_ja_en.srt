1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:28,080
While I tried my best, I wanted to learn to pa

2
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:36,080
This program is brought to you by the following sponsors

3
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:46,080
Good evening everyone

4
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,080
Good evening

5
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,080
What should we start with?

6
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:58,080
Let's start with the one with the eyes

7
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:00,080
What are you doing?

8
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:04,080
Hamada-kun

9
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:12,080
Okay

10
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,080
Wow

11
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,080
That's the way I do it

12
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:34,080
I finished one

13
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:40,080
Please eat it with lemon juice

14
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,080
With a little bit of lemon juice

15
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:50,080
It looks delicious

16
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,080
It's melting

17
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,080
Okay

18
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,080
I know this

19
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:10,080
Okay

20
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,080
Please eat it all

21
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,080
It's okay

22
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,080
It's good

23
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:30,080
Is it okay?

24
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,080
It's okay

25
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,080
It looks like eggplant tempura

26
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,080
Please bring a small bowl

27
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,080
I'm so happy

28
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,080
This is impossible

29
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,080
Okay

30
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,080
Do you have it?

31
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,080
That's good

32
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,080
Do you have any good memories?

33
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,080
This is a bit dangerous

34
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,080
It's okay

35
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,080
I don't care

36
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,080
Do you have some beans?

37
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,080
Yes

38
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,080
This is...

39
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,080
Okay

40
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,080
Okay

41
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,080
Please eat it with salt

42
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,080
It's good, right?

43
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,080
Yes

44
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,080
Do you need this?

45
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,080
That's good

46
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,080
Do you want a shirt?

47
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,080
This one?

48
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,080
It's new

49
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,080
This is...

50
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,080
Only one side

51
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,080
I see

52
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:10,080
Please eat it with lemon juice

53
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,080
Let's take it

54
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,080
He's shooting a gun

55
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:18,080
He's shooting a gun

56
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:20,080
He's shooting a gun

57
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:24,080
Okay

58
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,080
Let's change the place

59
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:36,080
Okay

60
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,080
Please eat it with salt

61
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,080
Okay

62
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,080
Please eat it with salt

63
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,080
This is the first time to eat eggplant

64
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,080
Yes

65
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:02,080
Please eat it with salt

66
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,080
This is the first time

67
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:28,080
Please eat it with salt

68
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:34,080
Please eat it with salt

69
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,080
It's ready

70
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,080
Okay

71
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,080
Wait

72
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,080
It's hot

73
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,080
Please eat it with lemon juice

74
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:58,080
Please eat it with lemon juice

75
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,080
How about this?

76
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,080
That's good

77
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:10,080
Please eat it with salt

78
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,080
That's good

79
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,080
That's good

80
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:36,080
There's oil inside

81
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:48,080
This is the best

82
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,080
Thank you

83
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,080
Thank you

84
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:58,080
Can someone give this to me?

85
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,080
Earrings

86
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:04,080
Please give me something that I can't take back

87
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,080
Please eat it with salt

88
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,080
Please give this to me

89
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,080
That's good

90
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:28,080
Please eat it with salt

91
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:38,080
Please eat it with salt

92
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,080
That's good

93
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,080
Wait

94
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,080
That's good

95
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,080
That's good

96
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,080
That's good

97
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,080
You did a good job

98
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,080
In September

99
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,080
In September?

100
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,080
The customers have changed

101
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,080
Yes

102
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,080
Thank you

103
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:18,080
Ladies and gentlemen

104
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,080
That's good

105
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,080
That's good

106
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,080
This program is held in many halls

107
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,080
We don't have fixed time

108
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,080
Tomorrow is Kojimachi

109
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,080
Tomorrow is...

110
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:38,080
This hall has the worst air condition

111
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,080
Last week we started a little late

112
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,080
We were talking for a while

113
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,080
We talked for about 5 minutes

114
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,080
We couldn't stop

115
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:54,080
You can stop when it's time

116
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,080
Why?

117
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,080
It's until 10 o'clock

118
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,080
Last week we started late

119
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,080
It was already 10 o'clock

120
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,080
We were talking and sweating

121
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,080
We couldn't stop

122
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,080
It's already 10 o'clock

123
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,080
I'm sorry

124
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,080
I'm sorry

125
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,080
It's hot

126
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,080
It's too hot

127
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,080
Everyone is hot

128
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,080
My nose is low

129
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,080
Let me see

130
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,080
Listen to me

131
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:28,080
You don't understand anything about human

132
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,080
You don't understand what I'm saying

133
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,080
You don't understand

134
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,080
You

135
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,080
You have a low nose when it's hot

136
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,080
You have a low nose when it's hot

137
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,080
You have a low nose when it's hot

138
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,080
I'm sorry

139
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,080
I'm sorry

140
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,080
I'm sorry

141
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,080
Why?

142
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,080
Why?

143
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,080
Why?

144
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,080
I don't know

145
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,080
Why?

146
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,080
Why?

147
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,080
In hot countries

148
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,080
In hot countries

149
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,080
In cold countries

150
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,080
What are you talking about?

151
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,080
Even if you say it twice

152
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,080
Are you in hot countries or cold countries?

153
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,080
Which one are you?

154
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,080
You seem to be proud

155
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,080
It's fine

156
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,080
What is it?

157
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,080
Eh?

158
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,080
In cold countries

159
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,080
In cold countries

160
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,080
In cold countries it's difficult

161
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,080
Why?

162
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,080
You're so mean

163
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,080
You're so mean

164
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,080
You're so mean

165
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,080
In cold countries

166
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:38,080
The temperature is low

167
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:40,080
If you directly enter your nose, you'll get a fever

168
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,080
If you directly enter your nose, you'll get a fever

169
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:44,080
By raising your nose

170
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,080
If you directly enter your nose, you'll get a fever

171
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,080
The temperature will be raised

172
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,080
By raising your nose

173
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,080
And in hot countries

174
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,080
It doesn't matter if you directly accept it

175
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,080
And it will lower your nose

176
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,080
That's it

177
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:08,080
So, let's talk about the heavy stuff.

178
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:12,080
What are you talking about?

179
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,080
How have you been recently?

180
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,080
Recently?

181
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,080
Yes.

182
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:22,080
Oh, the other day, when I was watching TV, I was doing something like this.

183
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,080
In the middle of the night.

184
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:28,080
There were three guys hanging out.

185
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:31,080
Two of them looked like surfers.

186
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,080
I thought, oh, they'll get caught.

187
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,080
I said, I'll talk to them.

188
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,080
They were cute.

189
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,080
But there was one more.

190
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,080
He was wearing a black tank top.

191
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,080
He was wearing a jean.

192
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:44,080
He was torn around here.

193
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:47,080
He was wearing this in a fashionable way.

194
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:51,080
He was so fat.

195
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:54,080
He was hanging out with the two of them.

196
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:57,080
The reporter asked him why he was hanging out with them.

197
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:02,080
The cute guy said, well, I thought it was okay.

198
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:10,080
But the fat guy said, it's just a feeling.

199
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:13,080
It's the worst thing to say.

200
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:16,080
That's why I can't speak English.

201
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,080
I remember that.

202
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:22,080
The fat guy said, Popeye, Popeye made me laugh.

203
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:27,080
Now, the bad guy is cool.

204
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,080
It's exciting.

205
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,080
That's right.

206
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:34,080
Well, I'm a bad guy, too.

207
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:37,080
Well, if you look at it, it's about me.

208
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,080
I see.

209
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,080
Well, I'm in it, too.

210
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,080
Bad.

211
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:45,080
I'm very sensitive to the word bad.

212
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,080
That's right.

213
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,080
If you say bad.

214
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:50,080
What's wrong?

215
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,080
I'm the type to get angry.

216
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,080
If you say bad.

217
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:56,080
Why do you think it's bad?

218
00:12:56,080 --> 00:13:00,080
It's funny, isn't it?

219
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:03,080
If you look at it, there's a lot of things.

220
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:07,080
A celebrity or a celebrity's girl is a bad guy.

221
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,080
It's written.

222
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:11,080
It's not enough to be kind.

223
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:16,080
It's like a curry day.

224
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:22,080
And finally, the bad guy couple in town.

225
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,080
I see.

226
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,080
The bad guy is going to be popular from now on.

227
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,080
I thought I had to be bad.

228
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,080
That kindness.

229
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,080
There's a picture.

230
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,080
The bad guy couple in town.

231
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,080
That's right.

232
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,080
This is what a man is like.

233
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,080
It's a little tight.

234
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:39,080
All the women on the side are the worst.

235
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:44,080
I'm a bad guy.

236
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,080
Don't be bad.

237
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,080
I'm not going to let you catch me.

238
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:51,080
It's like a life insurance number.

239
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,080
But isn't that what it is?

240
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,080
What?

241
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:57,080
I'm not the one to say, oh, that's great.

242
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,080
Yes.

243
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,080
What?

244
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:02,080
I laughed a little at Popai's special.

245
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,080
Oh, really?

246
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,080
Yes.

247
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:08,080
But I saw that fat guy moving around in a brown car.

248
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:13,080
When there are three or four women, there's only one.

249
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,080
That's right.

250
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:17,080
I can't help it.

251
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:20,080
That's what humans are like.

252
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:23,080
For example, isn't it true that you're a celebrity?

253
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:28,080
I don't know.

254
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,080
A celebrity?

255
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,080
A celebrity.

256
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,080
A celebrity.

257
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,080
A celebrity.

258
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,080
A celebrity.

259
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,080
Yes.

260
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,080
On TV?

261
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,080
Yes, a celebrity.

262
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,080
A celebrity.

263
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,080
A celebrity.

264
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,080
A celebrity.

265
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,080
No.

266
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,080
A celebrity.

267
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,080
A celebrity.

268
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,080
A celebrity.

269
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,080
A celebrity.

270
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,080
Say it again.

271
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,080
A celebrity.

272
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,080
Yes, a celebrity.

273
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:51,080
For example, let's take a look at this.

274
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,080
Downtown.

275
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:58,080
It's ugly.

276
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:03,080
It's ugly and dull.

277
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:06,080
Right?

278
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:08,080
It can't be helped.

279
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,080
It can't be helped, it can't be helped.

280
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:11,080
It's totally the truth.

281
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,080
Here I come.

282
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:21,080
I have something I don't know about the train seats.

283
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,080
Yes.

284
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:27,080
For some reason, there is a color change for one person on the seats for eight people.

285
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,080
Ah, ah, ah.

286
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,080
There is.

287
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:31,080
Is it brownish or something like that?

288
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,080
Who is that for?

289
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:34,080
No, what is it made for?

290
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:37,080
No, if someone sits there, look.

291
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:40,080
Eight people can sit properly.

292
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,080
Somehow...

293
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:52,080
It's like a heat tire.

294
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:54,080
Ah, is it hot?

295
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:56,080
What is that? Did you think of it yourself?

296
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,080
Can you tell your mother?

297
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,080
Why?

298
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:01,080
I'm already 31.

299
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,080
Why, mother?

300
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:05,080
Did you come all the way here by yourself?

301
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:07,080
Yes.

302
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:09,080
Who thought of it?

303
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:11,080
Who thought of it? I was saying something.

304
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,080
Somehow...

305
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:15,080
I heard something bad about it.

306
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,080
What is that?

307
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,080
It's something wrong that has been input.

308
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,080
You remembered something wrong.

309
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,080
Really?

310
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,080
Please tell me.

311
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,080
That is...

312
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,080
Yes.

313
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,080
What are you going to write?

314
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,080
Yes.

315
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:29,080
In the place where the colors are different...

316
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:32,080
Why are the colors different? At first, the colors were all the same.

317
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:37,080
However, there was an old man who sat there forever.

318
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:40,080
The other places were on fire.

319
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:44,080
It didn't matter that the colors gradually faded.

320
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:47,080
Because that old man was there forever.

321
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:51,080
Because that old man was there,

322
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:54,080
it became possible for eight people to sit properly.

323
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,080
Everything is different.

324
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,080
Right?

325
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:00,080
That's not true.

326
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,080
Please tell me the truth.

327
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,080
You want to hear the truth?

328
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,080
Yes.

329
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:06,080
You really want to hear the truth, don't you?

330
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:08,080
No matter what happens, you want to hear the truth, don't you?

331
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:09,080
That's true.

332
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:12,080
Give me a little more time.

333
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:14,080
Yes.

334
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,080
I'll announce it at the end.

335
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:17,080
Yes.

336
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:21,080
Why are there no fat people among criminals?

337
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:24,080
Why are there no fat people among criminals?

338
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:27,080
That's not true.

339
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:32,080
Fat people are...

340
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:36,080
To put it simply, fat people are hard to deal with.

341
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,080
Is that so?

342
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,080
They don't kill people.

343
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:44,080
It's not just killing people.

344
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,080
It's a crime.

345
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,080
Who are you?

346
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:51,080
Why are you here?

347
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,080
I'm sorry.

348
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,080
There are various crimes.

349
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:01,080
It's not just killing people.

350
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:05,080
I'll announce it at the end.

351
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,080
Yes.

352
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,080
You won't be able to take your eyes off until the end of the show.

353
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:13,080
It's going to be a mess in 30 minutes.

354
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,080
I'll stop now.

355
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:16,080
Thank you.

356
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,080
I'm a person from Tokyo.

357
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:24,080
When I was a kid, I often went to my friend's house and called him from the outside.

358
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:27,080
Hamada-kun.

359
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,080
I shouted loudly.

360
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:31,080
The person who was called...

361
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:33,080
Ha-in.

362
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:37,080
I deliberately extended the word and replied.

363
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,080
How do you call your friends in Osaka?

364
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:43,080
Why did I have to extend the word?

365
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,080
That's why...

366
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,080
Hamada-kun.

367
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,080
I'm different.

368
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,080
Hamada-kun.

369
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,080
Let's play.

370
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:02,080
And when I was in the second half of elementary school, my voice changed.

371
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,080
The soprano that had appeared so far...

372
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,080
It's gone.

373
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,080
It's gone.

374
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,080
That's when I thought of Hamada-kun.

375
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:12,080
That's too sudden.

376
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:15,080
The person who has a sense of rhythm is Hamada-kun.

377
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,080
Hamada-kun.

378
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,080
At the front door of a person's house.

379
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,080
Isn't it different?

380
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,080
Isn't it the same in Tokyo?

381
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:39,080
When I went to the bathroom, I was told to count 10.

382
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:42,080
The way to count that number is completely different.

383
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:55,080
We count 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

384
00:19:55,080 --> 00:20:03,080
11, 12, 13, 14...

385
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:05,080
This is the saddest part.

386
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,080
Why is it sad?

387
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:11,080
It depends on the region.

388
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:16,080
Osaka is like this, but when you go to Kyushu or Hokkaido, it's different.

389
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:22,080
Osaka people are said to be the fastest to walk in the world.

390
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:25,080
Osaka people have a sense of rhythm.

391
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:30,080
If you go to Osaka and observe the people walking on the streets, it's different from Tokyo.

392
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:34,080
They walk fast, and sometimes they walk like this.

393
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,080
Hiragawa-san.

394
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,080
You can do backflip.

395
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:43,080
You have to look at those things carefully.

396
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,080
Let's go home.

397
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,080
It's okay.

398
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,080
Let's go home.

399
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:55,080
If you say it, I'll answer it properly.

400
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:57,080
It's you!

401
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:59,080
It's you!

402
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:01,080
It's dirty!

403
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,080
It's you!

404
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,080
I didn't do that.

405
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,080
Answer quickly!

406
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,080
Say it again.

407
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,080
Say it again.

408
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,080
Say it again what you want to hear.

409
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,080
Say it.

410
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,080
You have to say it again.

411
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,080
The atmosphere is bad.

412
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,080
I'll say it.

413
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,080
On the train.

414
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,080
There's a seat.

415
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,080
Only one seat is brown.

416
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,080
Only one seat.

417
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,080
Why is that seat brown?

418
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,080
Isn't it cream-colored?

419
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,080
It's cream-colored.

420
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,080
It's cream-colored.

421
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,080
Why is that seat cream-colored?

422
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,080
That's the question.

423
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,080
In the past,

424
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,080
I wonder if it still exists today.

425
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,080
Grandpas and grandmas had their own seats.

426
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,080
They had their own silver seats.

427
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,080
They had their own roles.

428
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,080
I see.

429
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,080
On the plane, it was first class.

430
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,080
It was business class.

431
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,080
Everyone had their own seat.

432
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,080
I see.

433
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,080
Why is it cream-colored?

434
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,080
I'll say it again.

435
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,080
It was the first class!

436
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,080
That's it!

437
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,080
I'm scared.

438
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,080
Okay.

439
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,080
I was really scared in the middle!

440
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,080
You?
