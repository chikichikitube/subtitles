1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The famous prodigy is Hamada, who was called by the name of Sugano.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
You know, we did the 4th episode of Shihadori.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I got a complaint that I was doing it slowly.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
This is the challenge of the previous episode, which became a problem.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
The wheat of Hayamagashi, which is said to have died because of the suffering of Hayate of Matsumoto, is gone.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
That was a good rating.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
So what are you going to do?

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
The 5th episode.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
That's enough.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm sick of it.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
No, that's not it.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm telling you it's dangerous. What if you get hurt?

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I haven't been hurt 4 times so far.

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I haven't been hurt so far, but I think I can do it.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Don't get angry.

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Masato, wait a minute.

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Don't get angry.

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Listen to Shihadori.

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
You have to listen carefully.

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I did Shihadori 4 times.

21
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I did it.

22
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
That's the project you gave me.

23
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
You were a talent before you won the first place in Shihadori, right?

24
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I did Shihadori.

25
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I did Shihadori.

26
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I got a complaint that I was doing it slowly.

27
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I got a complaint that I was doing it slowly.

28
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
What's your answer?

29
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I don't know.

30
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I admit that.

31
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
That's enough.

32
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I don't like the talent video I'm doing now.

33
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I'm like a TV show.

34
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I'm like a TV show.

35
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I'm going to call you a teacher from now on.

36
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Who are you?

37
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Who are you?

38
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I'm going to bring it.

39
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I'm going to bring it.

40
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I'm going to bring it.

41
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I'm going to bring it.

42
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I'm going to bring it.

43
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Don't go.

44
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
If you don't want to do it, don't do it.

45
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
If he takes this attitude, I'll be angry.

46
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Who are you talking to?

47
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Maa-kun.

48
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Maa-kun.

49
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I told you I'd do it.

50
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I told you I'd do it.

51
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I told you I'd do it.

52
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I told you I'd do it.

53
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Matsumoto Shitoji appeared in Shibotoshita Shiro Shibozoku.

54
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
What are you doing?

55
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I'm going to do it.

56
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I'll buy you.

57
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I'm going to do it.

58
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
After all,

59
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
after all,

60
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
In short,

61
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
In short,

62
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I have to do it.

63
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I'm going to do it.

64
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I'll get hurt.

65
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I'm going to die.

66
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I'm going to get hurt.

67
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I'm going to get hurt.

68
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Listen to me seriously!

69
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Stop it!

70
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
What is it?

71
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
It's not a fast turn.

72
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
It's not a reverse turn.

73
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I'm not going to use any tools.

74
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I'm going to do it with all my heart.

75
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
If you don't do it with me, we'll do it together.

76
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
That's right.

77
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I don't know.

78
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I don't know either.

79
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Let's go.

80
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
What are you talking about?

81
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Let's go.

82
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I'm not going to use any tools.

83
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I'm going to do it with all my heart.

84
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Let's go.

85
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
What are you talking about?

86
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Let's go.

87
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
What are you talking about?

88
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Let's go.

89
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Let's go.

90
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
What are you talking about?

91
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Let's go.

92
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
What are you talking about?

93
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Let's go.

94
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
This program is brought to you by the following sponsors.

95
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Let's go.

96
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Are you ready?

97
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Yes.

98
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Come on!

99
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Okay.

100
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Let's go.

101
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Let's go.

102
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
What are you doing?

103
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Don't touch me.

104
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
It's my fault.

105
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I'll call the electrician.

106
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Yama.

107
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
It's dangerous.

108
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
It hurts.

109
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Don't step on me.

110
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I'm going to get hurt.

111
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I'm going to do it.

112
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Why are you hitting me?

113
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Are you an electrician?

114
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I'm an electrician.

115
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I'm an electrician.

116
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Are you an electrician?

117
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I'm an electrician.

118
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I'm sorry.

119
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Are you okay?

120
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Are you okay?

121
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Don't think about it.

122
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I'm sorry.

123
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I told the electrician.

124
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I can light up four bulbs.

125
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
It's okay.

126
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Let's go.

127
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
It's okay if it's this bright.

128
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
If there's another one, I'll light it up.

129
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
It's okay.

130
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
It's bright enough.

131
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I'll light it up.

132
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I'll light it up.

133
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
It's okay.

134
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I'll light it up.

135
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I'll do it.

136
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
It's okay.

137
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I'll do it.

138
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
What is this?

139
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
What are you doing?

140
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Yamazaki, call the electrician.

141
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Okay.

142
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:33,000
It's okay if it's this bright.

143
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
It's okay if it's this bright.

144
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
If there's another one, I'll light it up.

145
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
You do it.

146
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I'll do it.

147
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
It's okay if it's this bright.

148
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Can you do it?

149
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I'm sorry.

150
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I'll do it next time.

151
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I'm sorry.

152
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I'm sorry.

153
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I can't do it with just one bulb.

154
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
It's okay if it's this bright.

155
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
It's okay if it's this bright.

156
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Can I light it up?

157
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
It's okay.

158
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
You can try it.

159
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
It's okay.

160
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Let's go.

161
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Let's go.

162
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I'm sorry.

163
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
It's okay.

164
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
It's okay.

165
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Please be careful.

166
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I'm sorry.

167
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
That's all for today.

168
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I went too far.

169
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
What is it today?

170
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I want to say that I made a wish.

171
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I didn't say it yet.

172
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
You won't say it yet?

173
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
What if I say it?

174
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I'll say it again.

175
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I heard it last time 5 or 6 years ago.

176
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
It's hard to make jokes with a laugh.

177
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
So I...

178
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
The lines here are really thick, you know?

179
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
So when I'm at home, I buy a TV and I can only watch that kind of stuff.

180
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
What are you talking about?

181
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
It's funny!

182
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I was watching it, but I couldn't draw the lines at all.

183
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Like this.

184
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Why are you looking at it like that?

185
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I was looking at it like this.

186
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
This is one of the 7 mysteries of the entertainment world.

187
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
The 9th one is...

188
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
What are the 8th ones before that?

189
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
The 8th one before that is...

190
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Why is Tama running around?

191
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Leave me alone! I've been doing this for years!

192
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
There are a lot of mysteries.

193
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I have a hard time with my nerves.

194
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I'm an old man. I'm 30 years old.

195
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I've lost a lot of strength.

196
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Really?

197
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
In the past, I was amazing, but I've lost a lot of strength.

198
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
In the past, I shot guns every night.

199
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Where did you shoot them?

200
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Where did you shoot the guns?

201
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
There was a mark on the carpet.

202
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
You shot guns on the carpet?

203
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
At that time, you were caught by a cheetah's tail.

204
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I ran and got caught by a cheetah's tail.

205
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Where were you?

206
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I didn't care where I was.

207
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
It has nothing to do with me!

208
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
It has nothing to do with me!

209
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I don't remember where I was.

210
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
So, where were you?

211
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I don't remember.

212
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
It was really hard.

213
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I know that I'm going to die soon.

214
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I think it's going to be 2 or 3 years later.

215
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I'm going to do scuba diving with my eyes full.

216
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I'm going to dive where I usually don't.

217
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
You've never done scuba diving, have you?

218
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
No, I've never done it.

219
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
You're lying.

220
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Let's do it today.

221
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Can you teach me how to do scuba diving?

222
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I want to do scuba diving.

223
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I've never done it.

224
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Teach me how to do it.

225
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
You look like Yasukyo.

226
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Teach me how to do it.

227
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
This is a tank.

228
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I'm going to carry this.

229
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
You're going to carry this?

230
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I'm going to carry this, too.

231
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I'm going to put this in.

232
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
If I put this in, I can breathe.

233
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Don't put it in.

234
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Don't put it in.

235
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Let's go over there.

236
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
What are you talking about?

237
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
What are you talking about?

238
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I'm sorry.

239
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I'm sorry.

240
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
It's been a while.

241
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I'm sorry.

242
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I have to do it.

243
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I have to do it.

244
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I'm very fast.

245
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I know that.

246
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I'll die in three years.

247
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I'll die in three years.

248
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I can do what I want to do.

249
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I'm just wondering how I'm going to die.

250
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
You're going to be stabbed.

251
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Damn it.

252
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
What are you talking about?

253
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I'm a woman.

254
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
You're a woman?

255
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Let's do it.

256
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Who's going to be in the condo?

257
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Why?

258
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
There's a lot of things.

259
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Someone's going to come.

260
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
With this.

261
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
That's not going to happen.

262
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,000
But you can't tell me that there's a woman here, can you?

263
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I'll tell you that you're not alone.

264
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
That's why I don't feel like I've been deceived by that woman.

265
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
What about me?

266
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I don't do a lot of presents, but I don't do it here.

267
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
That's right.

268
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I was talking to Shinsuke Shimada the other day.

269
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I don't think I should have said that.

270
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
What are you talking about?

271
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
No, no.

272
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I don't do presents.

273
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
After we broke up, we hit 1 million.

274
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
How many times did I say that?

275
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
300,000?

276
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
We hit 300,000.

277
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I didn't do anything that would hit 300,000.

278
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Why did you keep your face red at that time?

279
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I'll do it.

280
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Why didn't you come out?

281
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I admit that my face was a little red, but...

282
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Was it red?

283
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
The studio was hot, and I'm originally from Akita.

284
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
What are you talking about?

285
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I'm from Akita, so I can't come.

286
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
No, you can't.

287
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I don't think there's anything like that.

288
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,000
What are you talking about?

289
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
How do you die?

290
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
How do you die?

291
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I'll die.

292
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Why are you telling me to die?

293
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
You'll be alone until you die.

294
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
What are you talking about?

295
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:19,000
There's a time when I want to have a child.

296
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
You can't make a name for yourself.

297
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I want to raise a child like me.

298
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:42,000
It's different from you guys.

299
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Did you see it?

300
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I'm doing this.

301
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Did you see me doing this?

302
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
That's how I was raised.

303
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I was raised really well.

304
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
For example?

305
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:01,000
First of all, I'll give you money when you're in elementary school.

306
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
If it's 10 million yen, I'll give you 10 million yen.

307
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:08,000
From now on, I'll give you 10 million yen.

308
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
You can do everything with this.

309
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I'll pay for your school lunch from there.

310
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I'll give you money for your school trip from there.

311
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:22,000
If you want to eat only sweets, you can buy sweets with 10 million yen.

312
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
But you can't go on a school trip.

313
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
You can't go to high school either.

314
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I tried it.

315
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:36,000
But if you say something good, you'll get a good one.

316
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
You're an old man in elementary school.

317
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
On the contrary, you'll lose your cuteness and crap.

318
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
In a sense.

319
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I don't like your voice.

320
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Do you want to increase the tempo?

321
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Why does Yumi Shirakawa often appear in the drama where Hama-chan appears?

322
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I don't know.

323
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
That's what the casting is like.

324
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:16,000
What are you laughing at?

325
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
What kind of laugh is that?

326
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:28,000
It depends on how you do it.

327
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
But that's strange.

328
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
That's strange.

329
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:40,000
It's not like the old Momoe-chan and Tomokazu Miura.

330
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
He appears in everything.

331
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
That's strange.

332
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
There must be something.

333
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,000
That's not something I can do.

334
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,000
If it's Shirakawa-san, I'll say, yeah!

335
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
You're not saying that?

336
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I'm saying it!

337
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I'm sure there are people who think you're saying that on TV.

338
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
That's strange.

339
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
What is Shirakawa Yumi?

340
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Is it Downtown?

341
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Why is it always the same?

342
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
It's strange.

343
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I'm going to go to court again this evening.

344
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Why?

345
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Is there such a thing?

346
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I'll look it up.

347
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I've been to Meiji-kun.

348
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Wait a minute.

349
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I've been to Meiji-kun.

350
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Wait a minute.

351
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
No one said it was just the two of you.

352
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
It's not a co-star.

353
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
It's not a common excuse.

354
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
It's true.

355
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,000
What is this?

356
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,000
It's like a rice field.

357
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Have you ever seen a rice field?

358
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Why do your eyebrows grow longer as you get older?

359
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,000
It doesn't make any sense to take it to another place for nutrition.

360
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
What is it?

361
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
The lines are strange.

362
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
You're a machia.

363
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:26,000
For example, there are three grooves in the middle of the head.

364
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
There are three lines.

365
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Normally, there are three lines in the middle of the head, but this line is in the middle of the head.

366
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
That's why...

367
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I feel like I'm going to get better.

368
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I don't really care.

369
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
You're like Osamu-san.

370
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I do it sometimes, but I don't care.

371
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Osamu-chan.

372
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Why do your eyebrows grow longer?

373
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I don't know.

374
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
There's a shoulder hair.

375
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
There's a shoulder hair.

376
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
There's a shoulder hair.

377
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Really?

378
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Around here?

379
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
My brother has a back hair.

380
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
A back hair?

381
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,000
It's like a sofa.

382
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
What is this?

383
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Is a bird staying here?

384
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
It's not.

385
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
It's like a bird's head.

386
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Who is the bird?

387
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Well...

388
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:43,000
The reason why there are two lines is...

389
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Why are there two lines?

390
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Is that true?

391
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Is it wrong to have one line?

392
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
That's right.

393
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:57,000
You're standing like this.

394
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I'm not standing.

395
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
You're standing.

396
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I'm not standing.

397
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
There are times when I stand.

398
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,000
I'm standing like this.

399
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Have you ever seen it in the mirror?

400
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Yes, I have.

401
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:21,000
You're moving like this.

402
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Are you serious?

403
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
I was surprised when you made it clear at first.

404
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:33,000
And then, in the end, you fall down.

405
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
What is this?

406
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
What are the two lines?

407
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
You're making two lines, aren't you?

408
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
You're making two lines, aren't you?

409
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:46,000
You're making two lines, aren't you?

410
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
What are you talking about?

411
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
What are you talking about?

412
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
You can't make it with two people.

413
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,000
You can't make it with two people.

414
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
That was funny.

415
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,000
It's usually two people.

416
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Why are there two lines?

417
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:09,000
In the past, there were 12 lines.

418
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
There were 12 lines?

419
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
There were 10 more?

420
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
It's said that there were 100 lines of instinct.

421
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
I like that.

422
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,000
There are 12 lines.

423
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,000
There are 12 lines?

424
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Yes, there are.

425
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Really?

426
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
What?

427
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
These two lines are the remaining ones.

428
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:39,000
These are love and courage.

429
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
What is this?

430
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
We're holding love and courage.

431
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
We do this every day.

432
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Hello.

433
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Love and courage.

434
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Hello.

435
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
That's right.

436
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
It's connected to what I said earlier.

437
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
It's about whether love wins or courage wins.

438
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
What are you talking about?

439
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Everyone does that.

440
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
What's in the remaining 10 lines?

441
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Everyone has their own story.

442
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
What is it?

443
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,000
When humans are born and live,

444
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
they lie when they have to do bad things.

445
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
They make their parents cry.

446
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:21,000
They fall one by one.

447
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
You should follow them.

448
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:32,000
When you collect all 12 of them, your wish will come true.

449
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:55,000
This program was brought to you by these sponsors.
