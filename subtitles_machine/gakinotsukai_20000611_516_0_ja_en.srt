1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,640
Tsukishiki! Hamada Team vs. Matsumoto Team!

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:05,840
Owarai Draft High Tension Battle!

3
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:08,000
So Matsumoto-san!

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:08,500
Yes, yes!

5
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:09,600
You've already done it a few times.

6
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:10,100
That's right!

7
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:10,600
High Tension!

8
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:13,500
Today, I've changed my mind a bit.

9
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:18,300
First of all, before that, we have this assistant here.

10
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,500
What's with this guy?

11
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,500
Today, Idao isn't here, but...

12
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:23,500
He's only here to read?

13
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:24,900
But that's better, isn't it?

14
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,900
This side is like this.

15
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:29,200
There's a big thing attached to it.

16
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:32,000
He's always on my side, supporting me.

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,200
What's with this guy?

18
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,200
No, it's really...

19
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,000
What's with this guy?

20
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,500
No, it's really...

21
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:42,700
Don't come out!

22
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:52,000
This program is brought to you by the following sponsors.

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,100
Today, we're going to split up into Hamada Team and Matsumoto Team.

24
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,000
Today, we're going to be in 12 teams.

25
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,800
We're going to decide that in the draft.

26
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:00,500
That's right.

27
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:01,800
We're going to do it in a slightly different way.

28
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:02,300
Yes, thank you.

29
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:03,500
Let's get started!

30
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,700
Players, come in!

31
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:26,600
What is it?

32
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:27,300
What is it?

33
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:28,500
Your tension is really low.

34
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:29,700
It's low, isn't it?

35
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:30,300
I have a feeling.

36
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:31,100
Why is that?

37
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,700
You're going to make me explode from now on.

38
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,700
You must have something you're saving up for.

39
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:36,000
I think so.

40
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,700
Now, who's going to be Hamada-san?

41
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:39,500
And who's going to be on my team?

42
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:40,200
I don't know yet.

43
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,000
We're going to decide that in the draft.

44
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,500
Yes, yes.

45
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:43,500
Then, let's decide.

46
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,100
Rock-paper-scissors.

47
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:44,800
Yes, rock-paper-scissors.

48
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:45,300
Yes!

49
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:46,900
Hamada-san.

50
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,000
I won, so I'm going to do it.

51
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,500
Yes.

52
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,200
This is...

53
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,500
There's going to be a mistake, after all.

54
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:51,200
What?

55
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,900
There's going to be a mistake, after all.

56
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:54,500
Do you think all of this is a hit?

57
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:57,600
No, I don't think so, but I don't want to make a sudden mistake.

58
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,900
Well, that's true.

59
00:01:58,900 --> 00:01:59,500
Now, Uchiha.

60
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:00,500
Ameyawari.

61
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:01,500
Yes.

62
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,500
Thank you.

63
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:03,400
Thank you.

64
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,700
Oh, this is a pretty good shot.

65
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:06,300
What do you think?

66
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,000
This is a bit...

67
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,400
Matsumoto's team, the first one is...

68
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,400
Shouzo Endo.

69
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,400
Thank you.

70
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:15,800
After that, Hamada's team is...

71
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,600
Wow!

72
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,700
Tetsuro.

73
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:19,800
Yes!

74
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,400
And Matsumoto's team is...

75
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:23,500
Who is it?

76
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,700
Funky Monkey Clinic.

77
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:26,700
I'm not going to do it.

78
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:27,700
I'm not going to do it.

79
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:28,700
Are you okay?

80
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:29,700
I'm okay.

81
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:30,700
I don't know.

82
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:32,700
I can't do something like this.

83
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:33,700
I don't know.

84
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:35,700
I can't see Tetsu-chan anymore.

85
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:36,700
I can't see Tetsu-chan anymore.

86
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:37,700
Hamada-san, you're stupid.

87
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:40,700
If you get me, that means you got a chance card today.

88
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,700
That's what I'm saying right now.

89
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:43,700
I'm back!

90
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,700
The third one, Hamada's team is...

91
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:46,700
Kokoriko Tanaka.

92
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:47,700
Matsumoto's team is...

93
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,700
Yamazaki Hosei.

94
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,700
The fourth one, Hamada's team is...

95
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,700
The fourth one, Hamada's team is...

96
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,700
Ryuhei Ueshiba.

97
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:01,700
Good!

98
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,700
And Matsumoto's team is...

99
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,700
I wonder if it's okay.

100
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:07,700
Who is it?

101
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:08,700
I pulled it.

102
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:09,700
Ryō Fukawa.

103
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:14,700
Ryu-chan is so excited.

104
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:15,700
He's going to see this.

105
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:16,700
Anyway, please look at this.

106
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:17,700
Anyway, please look at this.

107
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:18,700
Anyway, please look at this.

108
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:19,700
Anyway, please look at this.

109
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,700
Tsuruto, you're heavy today.

110
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:24,700
It's normal.

111
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:25,700
I'm heavy.

112
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,700
You didn't say anything important.

113
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,700
Everyone is waiting.

114
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:30,700
I'm not ashamed.

115
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:31,700
Really?

116
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:32,700
I'm counting on you.

117
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:33,700
There are only two or three left.

118
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:34,700
First, Hamada's team is...

119
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:36,700
Ritton Chosodan.

120
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:37,700
Matsumoto's team is...

121
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,700
Jōdanzu.

122
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:42,700
And finally, Hamada will pull Yamaguchi.

123
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:45,700
The remaining monkeys will go to Matsumoto's team.

124
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,700
Now all the members have decided.

125
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,700
Matsumoto won.

126
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:52,700
The high tension battle of the air battle.

127
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,700
Kona and the fate of the Kong is...

128
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:55,700
The six of them.

129
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:58,700
Degawa, Ueshiba and the veterans are the key.

130
00:03:58,700 --> 00:03:59,700
Meanwhile, Matsumoto's team is...

131
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,700
Tsukawa, Pankinna and Wakate Chūshin.

132
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:04,700
How long will Yamazaki, who is left with anxiety, be able to do his best?

133
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,700
In the first half of the third round, Hamada's team will go first.

134
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:10,700
In the second half of the third round, Matsumoto's team will go first.

135
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:11,700
That's what we'll do.

136
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:12,700
That's right.

137
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:14,700
Now, let's introduce the judges.

138
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,700
The judge is Producer Sugawa Kenji.

139
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:17,700
Hello.

140
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:18,700
Hello.

141
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:21,700
He's a comedian.

142
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:22,700
He's a comedian.

143
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,700
He's a comedian.

144
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:27,700
The other three will be the judges.

145
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:28,700
The other three will be the judges.

146
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:29,700
I look forward to working with you.

147
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:32,700
Now, let's choose the players for the first round.

148
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:33,700
We'll start with Hamada's team.

149
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:36,700
Who do you think should go first?

150
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:37,700
That's right.

151
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:41,700
I understand that there's no such thing as going first.

152
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:44,700
But looking at Tanaka's face today,

153
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:46,700
it's obvious that he's going to slip.

154
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:47,700
Why?

155
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:51,700
I don't know how long it takes for a comedian to slip.

156
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:53,700
That's not true.

157
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:56,700
No one looks at me with confidence.

158
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,700
Everyone has confidence, right?

159
00:04:58,700 --> 00:04:59,700
Of course.

160
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:00,700
Thank you very much.

161
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:01,700
Tanaka, are you ready?

162
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:02,700
Oh!

163
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:03,700
Alright!

164
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:04,700
I understand!

165
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,700
Don't be silent when I say that.

166
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:07,700
Yes, I'll show you.

167
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:08,700
Okay?

168
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:09,700
Now, it's Tanaka's turn.

169
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,700
Who wants to go first?

170
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:12,700
Okay!

171
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:15,700
There's no one here.

172
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:20,700
You should hold a bell and move.

173
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:21,700
What should I do?

174
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:22,700
Alright!

175
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:23,700
Now!

176
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:24,700
Now!

177
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,700
Alright!

178
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,700
Well done!

179
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,700
I'll do my best.

180
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:31,700
I haven't told you yet,

181
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,700
but there's a punishment for the loser.

182
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:34,700
Oh, right.

183
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:35,700
There's a punishment.

184
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:36,700
I didn't say that.

185
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:37,700
Yes.

186
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:38,700
I want to avoid that.

187
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:39,700
Okay.

188
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:40,700
I'm counting on you.

189
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:41,700
Let's go.

190
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:42,700
Please get ready.

191
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:43,700
Okay.

192
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:44,700
Let's go!

193
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:45,700
Let's go!

194
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:46,700
Let's go!

195
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:49,700
Hamada team is

196
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:51,700
Kogoriko Tanaka Naoki

197
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,700
and Hassoro Viking!

198
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:58,700
What?

199
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:00,700
What?

200
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:06,700
Hey!

201
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:07,700
Hey!

202
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:08,700
Hey!

203
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:11,700
Why don't you leave me alone?

204
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:13,700
Why don't you leave me alone?

205
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:14,700
Hey!

206
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:15,700
Why?

207
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:19,700
Hey!

208
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:20,700
Why?

209
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:21,700
Hey!

210
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:22,700
Why?

211
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:24,700
To the back!

212
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:26,700
To the back!

213
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:27,700
To the back!

214
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:29,700
To the back!

215
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:32,700
I lost!

216
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:33,700
Viking!

217
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:36,700
I did it!

218
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:40,700
This is good! This is good!

219
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:41,700
Let's go!

220
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:43,700
On the side of Jodan's,

221
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:45,700
One person, Choshu!

222
00:06:45,700 --> 00:07:14,700
It hasn't changed!

223
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:17,700
Hey! What are you doing?

224
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:44,700
Hey! What are you doing?

225
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:49,700
Hey! What are you doing?

226
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:55,700
Where does it end?

227
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:59,700
This is stupid.

228
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:00,700
It's over, right?

229
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:01,700
Yes.

230
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:02,700
It's over there, right?

231
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:04,700
Yes.

232
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:11,700
It's over!

233
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:14,700
Well, to be honest, it was really long.

234
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:18,700
When I first heard it, I thought it was half of this.

235
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:19,700
I was so excited!

236
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:22,700
From the moment it started, I started dancing.

237
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:25,700
There was a biorhythm, right?

238
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:28,700
I thought it would be okay, but it got more and more interesting.

239
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:31,700
In the end, it went down.

240
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:34,700
What about this?

241
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:35,700
Let's continue.

242
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:43,700
I'll go with Ritton.

243
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:47,700
I feel like I can win with this.

244
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:48,700
I don't know about that.

245
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,700
But I have to make a move here.

246
00:08:50,700 --> 00:09:03,700
Well, what should I do?

247
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:11,700
Yasasaki!

248
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:17,700
Ritton Jyosa Dan Mizuno Toru's ideal woman!

249
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:22,700
Me and this girl's story

250
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:24,700
Part 1

251
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:28,700
5, 6, 9

252
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:33,700
Be quiet! Be quiet! Be quiet! Be quiet!

253
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,700
I'm so scared!

254
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,700
Part 2

255
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:37,700
Part 3

256
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:38,700
Part 4

257
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:39,700
Part 5

258
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:40,700
Part 6

259
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:41,700
Part 7

260
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:42,700
Part 8

261
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:43,700
Part 9

262
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:44,700
Part 10

263
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:45,700
Part 11

264
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:46,700
I'm sorry!

265
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:49,700
Kiss!

266
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:56,700
It's over.

267
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:59,700
It was fun.

268
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:02,700
Let's go to the second round.

269
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:11,700
Who will be the winner?

270
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:22,700
I made a mistake.

271
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,700
I made a mistake.

272
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,700
If you make a mistake, you can't do anything.

273
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:27,700
What do you mean by that?

274
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,700
That's not right.

275
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,700
There's no right answer.

276
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,700
I made a mistake.

277
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:34,700
No, no.

278
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:35,700
Wait a minute.

279
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,700
I'm sorry.

280
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:40,700
You can take a break.

281
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:43,700
Take a break.

282
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:44,700
I'm sorry.

283
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:45,700
I'm sorry.

284
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:46,700
I'll go again.

285
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:48,700
Yamazaki Hose.

286
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:52,700
Who will be the winner?

287
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:59,700
The world is about to collapse.

288
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:06,700
We're going to believe in each other.

289
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:10,700
Oh, oh!

290
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:13,700
Oh!

291
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:16,700
High-high-high!

292
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:19,700
Oh!

293
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,700
Yes yes!

294
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:23,700
Uyaaa!

295
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,700
Uwaaa!

296
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:27,700
It's not recording!

297
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:29,700
It's not recording!

298
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,700
O-Sei-san!

299
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,700
You're making a big deal out of it!

300
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,700
I can't do this anymore!

301
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,700
I can't do this anymore!

302
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,700
I can't do this anymore!

303
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,700
I can't do this anymore!

304
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,700
I can't do this anymore!

305
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,700
It's too late already!

306
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:49,700
It's too late already!

307
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:51,700
Apologize! Apologize!

308
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:53,700
I'm sorry!

309
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:57,700
It's over!

310
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:59,700
It's not like there's a mistake or anything like that!

311
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,700
I'm surprised!

312
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:03,700
You!

313
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:05,700
Let's do the 3rd round!

314
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:09,700
I'll do it with Tetsu-chan!

315
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,700
Please!

316
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,700
I'm counting on you!

317
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,700
I'm counting on you!

318
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,700
Alright!

319
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,700
Alright!

320
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:21,700
Listen to me!

321
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,700
Last year, my dad met with a destroyer!

322
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,700
Really?

323
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:27,700
Really! So I'll do my best!

324
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,700
I see!

325
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,700
So you're going to use your power of a minus!

326
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,700
That's right!

327
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,700
If it's such a sad story, I'll probably break up with my girlfriend!

328
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,700
If it's such a sad story, I'll probably break up with my girlfriend!

329
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,700
So close!

330
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,700
I'll do it a little bit more!

331
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,700
I'll do it a little bit more!

332
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,700
I'll do it a little bit more!

333
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:51,700
Tetsuro Degawa's strongest man in history!

334
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,700
Tetsuro Degawa's strongest man in history!

335
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,700
I'll do it!

336
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:57,700
I'll do it!

337
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:01,700
What are you wearing?

338
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:03,700
I'll go wild!

339
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:21,700
I'll go wild!

340
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,700
I'm sorry, I made a mistake.

341
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:28,700
60 minutes 20,000 yen course!

342
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:34,700
Hotel Daikomi!

343
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:38,700
Let's start!

344
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:42,700
You're the company's president, right?

345
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:45,700
What's going on?

346
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:49,700
You're the company's president, right?

347
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:52,700
What's going on?

348
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:56,700
You're a dog here!

349
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,700
That's not it!

350
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:00,700
If you say you want to extend it,

351
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:04,700
If you say you want to extend it,

352
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:10,700
This is the end!

353
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,700
Time's up!

354
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:14,700
Okay!

355
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,700
That was good!

356
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:18,700
That was good!

357
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:20,700
That was good!

358
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,700
That was good!

359
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,700
That was good!

360
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:26,700
Let's go with Fukawa!

361
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,700
Let's go!

362
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:30,700
Let's go!

363
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,700
Let's go!

364
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,700
That's Ryu-chan!

365
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,700
That's Ryu-chan!

366
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:38,700
That's Ryu-chan!

367
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,700
That's Ryu-chan!

368
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:42,700
Fukawa doesn't have the image of tension, right?

369
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:44,700
That's right!

370
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:46,700
That's why we have this!

371
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:48,700
That's why we have this!

372
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,700
We'll go like this!

373
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,700
We'll do our best with high tension!

374
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:54,700
We'll do our best with high tension!

375
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:56,700
No matter what they call it,

376
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:58,700
No matter what they call it,

377
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,700
I'm the one!

378
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,700
I'm the one!

379
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,700
I'm the one!

380
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:32,700
Fukawa Ryo's high tension number 5!

381
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:34,700
I wonder if he'll be able to stop it.

382
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,700
That was good!

383
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:58,700
It wasn't bad!

384
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,700
It wasn't bad!

385
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:02,700
The guy who's been picking beans!

386
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,700
The guy who's been picking beans!

387
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:14,700
Picking beans, picking beans

388
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,700
Picking beans, picking beans

389
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:24,700
Don't laugh and come out!

390
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:28,700
Picking beans, picking beans

391
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:32,700
Ready...

392
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,700
Ouch!

393
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:38,700
Ouch!

394
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,700
Picking beans, picking beans

395
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,700
Picking beans, picking beans

396
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:46,700
Ready...

397
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:48,700
Picking beans, picking beans

398
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:56,700
Damn it!

399
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:10,700
Picking beans, picking beans

400
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:12,700
Picking beans, picking beans

401
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:16,700
Goodbye!

402
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:18,700
Picking beans, picking beans

403
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:26,700
Damn it!

404
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,700
Let's try crying with a different high tension.

405
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,700
I see!

406
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:34,700
I can't do this!

407
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:36,700
When we all came out,

408
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:38,700
When we all came out,

409
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,700
I didn't have a diamond.

410
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,700
Thank you!

411
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:44,700
Thank you!

412
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,700
I can cry with this high tension!

413
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,700
I can cry with this high tension!

414
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,700
I can cry with this high tension!

415
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,700
I can cry with this high tension!

416
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:54,700
The next contest is

417
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:56,700

00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:41,700
Okay, okay, okay!

427
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,700
Yamaguchi Tomomitsu's...

428
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:46,700
Mukimukiyo!

429
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:54,700
Hikson! Hikson! Hikson! Hikson! Hikson! Hikson!

430
00:18:54,700 --> 00:19:04,700
Guitar Hikson! Guitar Hikson! Hikson! Hikson! Hikson! Hikson! Guitar Hikson!

431
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:14,700
Hikson is crazy! Hikson is crazy! Hikson is crazy! Hikson is crazy!

432
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:19,700
It's a crazy city

00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:20,700
Let's go!

434
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:26,700
This is a lot of work

435
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:30,700
I don't have any complaints

436
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:33,700
Who said I couldn't stop?

437
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:35,700
Almost everyone said that

438
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:38,700
Now it's the last one

439
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,700
The remaining is the end

440
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:41,700
Let's go!

441
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:42,700

This is a battle for the grand prize

445
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:50,700
That's right

446
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:51,700
Everyone, please

447
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:52,700
This is the last one

448
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,700
I didn't think it would be this easy

449
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:55,700
That's right

450
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,700
Look, I'm full of confidence

451
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:59,700
This is a competition

452
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:03,700
If you go behind the curtain, it will be messed up

453
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:06,700
You're weird

454
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:10,700
My face is all red

455
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:16,700

00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:26,700
Who wants to hit me?

458
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:32,700
Tell me his name

459
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:37,700
But I can't hit him

460
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:40,700
So I run away

461
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:44,700
I run away, I run away, I run away

462
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:49,700
I chase him with a whip

463
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:52,700
Who is that?

464
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:54,700
Who is that?

465
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:56,700
His name is

466
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:58,700
Kimi no Kokoro

467
00:20:58,700 --> 00:20:59,700
What?

468
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:02,700
What?

469
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:06,700
Why?

470
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:11,700
This is red

471
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:14,700
Let's go

472
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,700
Let's go to Miyasako

473
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:32,700
Itoshino Denjiha

474
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:33,700
Why?

475
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:34,700
Why?

476
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:35,700
Is it you?

477
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:36,700
Is it you?

478
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:37,700
Is it you?

479
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:40,700
Pick up the phone

480
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:41,700
Pick up the phone

481
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:42,700
Are you stupid?

482
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:44,700
Is it you?

483
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:45,700
Where is it?

484
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:46,700
Where is it?

485
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:47,700
Damn it

486
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:48,700
Come out to the front

487
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:49,700
And

488
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:50,700
Da da

489
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:51,700
Boyo boyo

490
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,700
Da da da

491
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:57,700
Okay

492
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:00,700
It was good

493
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:01,700
It was good

494
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:02,700
Thank you

495
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:03,700
It was good, everyone was good

496
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:04,700
What was good about this?

497
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,700
What was good about this?

498
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:09,700
If you say curry, it's shabashaba

499
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:13,700
I just melted the roux in the hot water

500
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,700
This is the end of the high tension

501
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:19,700
How will the captain's punishment be?

502
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:23,700
Judges, please raise your cards

503
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:24,700
Go ahead

The captain of the winning team, Hamada

00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:51,700
Will do the high tension of the player he has chosen

510
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:58,700
This is tough

511
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:00,700
It depends on what it is

512
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:02,700
What will it be?

513
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:04,700
Sing

514
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:10,700
I'll do it

515
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:15,700

It's been a long time

520
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:36,700
Mameshibori

521
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:38,700
What the hell?

522
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:40,700
Hey

523
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:46,700
