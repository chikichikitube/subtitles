1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,200
Hamada once again challenged the Matsumoto team to a 1-on-4 golf match.

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:10,000
Hamada was convinced that Matsumoto and Yamazaki would win the team play, but...

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
The beginner, Kokoriko Tanaka, got a miracle shot in a row!

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
As a result, Hamada lost to Matsumoya and Muzan.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Once again, he was punished for his fear.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
And two months ago...

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Finally, your punishment game has been decided.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
There's a game called Niteru Eigyouchu.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I've played it.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
You've played it, right?

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
It's about 100 times in 24 hours.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I think you should play it.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I've been saying Niteru Eigyouchu for a long time!

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
When I saw it for the first time, I was like, what is this guy doing?

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Is he trying to show off?

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
This guy is desperate!

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
He's going to lose this year!

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
This is how the punishment game was decided!

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Niteru Eigyouchu

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Niteru Eigyouchu is a 3-second campaign run by Japanese TV.

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:25,000
This time, Hamada Masatoshi will be on Niteru Eigyouchu for 24 hours on April 19th.

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:33,000
And the other day, a press conference was held ahead of the 24-hour Hamada Masatoshi Eigyouchu.

23
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Dear reporters, thank you very much for coming to the press conference for 24 hours of Hamada Masatoshi Eigyouchu.

24
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Hamada Masatoshi and Matsumoto Hitoshi will be joining us.

25
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
This program is brought to you by the following sponsors.

26
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:21,000
We will now hear from the chief producer of Niteru Eigyouchu, Kazuyuki Sakurada.

27
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Thank you very much for coming to this incredible event.

28
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:36,000
As you can see on the sign behind me, the 24-hour Hamada Masatoshi Eigyouchu.

29
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Up until now, I have not looked into this kind of project in every country in the world.

30
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:50,000
In particular, there were a lot of problems, including technology and other sections.

31
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,000
But we managed to put together a big project and make it happen.

32
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:10,000
So, I would like to ask Hamada Masatoshi to do his best to inspire the Japanese people.

33
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Thank you very much.

34
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:20,000
First, I would like to hear from Matsumoto Hitoshi about the penalty game.

35
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:31,000
As you know, Hamada Masatoshi used to say that he could beat us in golf.

36
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
But he lost.

37
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
So, I thought about his penalty game.

38
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:43,000
As you all know, Hamada Masatoshi is a dirty person.

39
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:49,000
As a talent, I think he deserves a D-class.

40
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
What can a D-class man do?

41
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
He is a piece of trash.

42
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
He is a loser.

43
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Shut up!

44
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
That's why I decided to give him a penalty game.

45
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Thank you very much.

46
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Now, I would like to hear from Hamada Masatoshi.

47
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I'm going to beat you up.

48
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
How do you feel about the rules?

49
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
1, 2, 3, 4, 4 people hit the ball.

50
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
You said you could win, but you lost.

51
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
That means you lost.

52
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I heard that you had a hard time with the technology.

53
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Then you should quit.

54
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
We think so, too.

55
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,000
To be honest, he is a dirty person.

56
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Shut up!

57
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
He is a D-class talent.

58
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
He is worse than before.

59
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
But he is wearing a T-shirt.

60
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I think he is motivated to do something dirty.

61
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Shut up!

62
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Now, I would like to hear from the reporters.

63
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Well...

64
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
It's been a while.

65
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I don't think you should quit.

66
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Do you really want to do it for 24 hours?

67
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I would like to hear from Hamada Masatoshi.

68
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
That's not true.

69
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
That's not true.

70
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
This is just a game.

71
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I'm sorry.

72
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
This is not a game.

73
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Isn't this an extra?

74
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
This is not an extra.

75
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
This is an extra.

76
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
This is an extra.

77
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
What are you talking about?

78
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
He is motivated to do something dirty.

79
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:05,000
This is a punishment game.

80
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
It's fun and easy.

81
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
You can do it.

82
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I don't think it's easy.

83
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
It's 24 hours.

84
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
You have to do your best.

85
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,000
No one knows you.

86
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
No one knows you.

87
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I see.

88
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Do you change the pattern every time?

89
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I don't know what to do at what time.

90
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I have it in my hand.

91
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Please tell me.

92
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:58,000
It starts at 5.30 a.m. and ends at 10 a.m.

93
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
You have to do your best.

94
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:09,000
The last one is at 26.40 a.m. and the last one is at 32 a.m.

95
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
This is amazing.

96
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:19,000
You have to change your costume every time.

97
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
You don't have a character.

98
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
What is the highlight of the game?

99
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I don't know.

100
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Please tell me.

101
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I make a lot of highlights.

102
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I made a lot of highlights.

103
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
You can't show it in 3 seconds.

104
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
You also made highlights, right?

105
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Yes, I did.

106
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
What kind of highlights?

107
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I heard you said you would do your best.

108
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I do my best.

109
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Please tell me.

110
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
What about you, Sakurada?

111
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I want you to think about it yourself.

112
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I thought you could win golf with your skills.

113
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Then I'll bet on you.

114
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Why?

115
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I don't know why I lost.

116
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
You lost twice.

117
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I didn't win that many times.

118
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I'll tell you a story.

119
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I used the same shaft as Tiger Woods.

120
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I prepared a shaft that would never be shaken.

121
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I've never heard of it.

122
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:59,000
It's amazing.

123
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Will Matsumoto watch the game on the same day?

124
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I don't want to see it.

125
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I don't think he'll watch it.

126
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
He knows what a D-class player does.

127
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
He's back.

128
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
He's back from F to D.

129
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I don't know when it will be on the same day.

130
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I don't think he'll watch it.

131
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I don't care if he watches it.

132
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:34,000
It depends on the day.

133
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I think Hama can do it.

134
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Good luck, Hama.

135
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
That's all.

136
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I heard you can do it for 24 hours without taking any water.

137
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I'm more worried about my body.

138
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Take some water.

139
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I don't want to make a legend.

140
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
How old are you, Hamada?

141
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I'm 40 years old.

142
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:16,000
It's hard to play 24 hours when you're 40.

143
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I don't drink water.

144
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
He said he'd take one of his six bones.

145
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
He said he'd do his best with five bones.

146
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
He's blue.

147
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I've heard a lot of things.

148
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Hamada, why do you have five bones?

149
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I have a question for Matsumoto.

150
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Matsumoto's mother appeared in the previous game.

151
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Will anyone else but Hamada participate in this game?

152
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I don't know.

153
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,000
My mother won't be able to participate in this game.

154
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:10,000
When I played the game, my father baked a rice cake.

155
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I didn't know what to bake.

156
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
My father was a little angry.

157
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
The next day

158
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Let's start the steel shooting.

159
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Thank you.

160
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Thank you.

161
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Thank you.

162
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Hamada Masato's 24-hour business starts at 5 a.m. on Monday, the 19th.

163
00:11:46,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Please look forward to Hamada's 32-hour business.
