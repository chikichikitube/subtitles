1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
From now on, we will begin the second trial of Akihiro Onuma.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Prosecutors and lawyers, please come forward.

3
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Next, the defendant, Akihiro Onuma, please come forward.

4
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Next, the defendant, Akihiro Onuma, please come forward.

5
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Prosecutors and lawyers, please come forward.

6
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Next, the defendant, Akihiro Onuma, please come forward.

7
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Next, the defendant, Akihiro Onuma, please come forward.

8
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Hmm? Wait a minute.

9
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Lately, everyone has been talking about me, so I might as well treat them to a meal.

10
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Alright, you guys. I'll take you to a meal.

11
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
What? You're going to treat us to a meal?

12
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Yay!

13
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Eddie is happy that Onuma is going to treat us to a meal.

14
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
However, Yoshinoya is the one who is going to treat Onuma.

15
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Welcome.

16
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
What should I have?

17
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Should I have a large serving?

18
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Excuse me, I'll have a large serving.

19
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Excuse me, Nami-mitsu.

20
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Hmm?

21
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Onuma is insisting on ordering Nami.

22
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Eddie has decided to follow suit.

23
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
And...

24
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Let's eat.

25
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
It's delicious.

26
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I'll have some oshinko.

27
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Where are you opening it?

28
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
How much do you want me to pay?

29
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I don't mind if it's just a little ginger.

30
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Onuma is angry at the 50-yen oshinko.

31
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
And the next day...

32
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Yesterday, a young man treated us to a meal.

33
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I'm so jealous.

34
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
As for this case, we'll have a witness.

35
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Is that alright?

36
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Please come forward.

37
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
This is terrible.

38
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
As a junior, I'll treat you to a meal.

39
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
For example, you two.

40
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I'll treat you to a meal.

41
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
You'll be happy, right?

42
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Yes, I'll be happy.

43
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I won't tell you what to eat.

44
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I'll just tell you to eat.

45
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I want to grab your heart.

46
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
What?

47
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
That's how it is.

48
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
That's how it feels.

49
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Is there anything else?

50
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Onuma often asks me to buy this and that.

51
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
He asks me to go shopping.

52
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
He says I can buy anything I want.

53
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I see.

54
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
You can buy anything you want.

55
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Yes, but...

56
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I don't have anything I want.

57
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Just for me?

58
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Or when I don't have enough.

59
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Really?

60
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Stand up.

61
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
What do you mean?

62
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I'm telling you to buy anything you want.

63
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
But you're giving me so much.

64
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
If I tell you what I want to eat,

65
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
and you calculate it,

66
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
you'll have a lot left.

67
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
What do you mean, I don't have enough?

68
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I knew this before,

69
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
but he doesn't know how valuable shopping is.

70
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I think I've known him for 20 years.

71
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
The kids are playing around.

72
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Matsumoto is dead.

73
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
It's a virtual reality show.

74
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
It's when they're telling their goodbyes

75
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
in the setting of Matsumoto is dead.

76
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
It's when they're telling their goodbyes

77
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
in the setting of Matsumoto is dead.

78
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I'm going to drink it up.

79
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
What should I do?

80
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
What should I do to make them accept?

81
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Onuma is having a hard time

82
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
because he can't think of anything funny.

83
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
While he's doing that, the rehearsal starts.

84
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Okay, let's start the rehearsal.

85
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
And then, Eddie...

86
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
What?

87
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Suddenly, everyone around him is laughing.

88
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
That was funny.

89
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
If we do that in real life,

90
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I'm sure we can do it.

91
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Really?

92
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Onuma, who has been watching this all along,

93
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:15,000
had a creepy smile on his face.

94
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
And finally, it's time for the real show.

95
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
The recording is going well,

96
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
and the order of Onuma has been changed.

97
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I wanted to end it with Matsumoto.

98
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
What?

99
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
What?

100
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
What?

101
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
What?

102
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
What?

103
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
What?

104
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
What?

105
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
What?

106
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
What?

107
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
What?

108
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
What?

109
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
The recording has been cut.

110
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
What do you think of this?

111
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
This is not a gold coin.

112
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
It's not a gold coin, but it's a kind of...

113
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
It's bigger than that.

114
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
That's right. It's a big sin.

115
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
It's a person's property.

116
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I'd like to ask Onuma about this.

117
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
This is completely messed up.

118
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I think there's a misunderstanding.

119
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I was going to do that before the recording.

120
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
That's a lie.

121
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
That's a lie.

122
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Then let's do it like that.

123
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I've been in the entertainment industry for a long time.

124
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I happened to be in the entertainment industry.

125
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
But if someone younger than me does it,

126
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I'll do it in a different way.

127
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I see.

128
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
That's an AD.

129
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
What do you think about that?

130
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
There's a saying that laughter is like water.

131
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
What do you mean?

132
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
That's...

133
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Don't say that in front of us.

134
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
That's a great statement.

135
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
That's a great statement.

136
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
That's a great statement.

137
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:23,000
A staff room for kids.

138
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:29,000
As usual, there are a few people in the meeting room.

139
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
This is a meeting, isn't it?

140
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
What?

141
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
This is a meeting, isn't it?

142
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Well...

143
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,000
If it's a meeting, I'll pay for it even if I eat.

144
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Okay.

145
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Then I'll take the delivery.

146
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Onuma, who made sure he didn't pay for it,

147
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
ordered a delivery to the AD.

148
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I'll have a beef curry.

149
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Okay.

150
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
And after 30 minutes, the delivery curry I ordered arrived.

151
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Thank you for waiting.

152
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
This is Onuma's.

153
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
What?

154
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Wait a minute.

155
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
That's strange.

156
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Why do you have more curry?

157
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
What do you mean?

158
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I ordered a large serving.

159
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
What?

160
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Why did you order a large serving?

161
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Idiot!

162
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,000
In the end, Onuma took a large serving from the AD.

163
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
It's delicious.

164
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Hello.

165
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Please come in.

166
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Please explain the situation of the delivery.

167
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
The curry will be delivered, right?

168
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:53,000
One person is out of the chair.

169
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I'm looking at the roux.

170
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
It's Miyadai-ku.

171
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
That's amazing.

172
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I think it's amazing.

173
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Stand up.

174
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Please stop the roux.

175
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Excuse me.

176
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Do you have any objections?

177
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Objections?

178
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Obviously, the amount is clear.

179
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
It was the same beef curry.

180
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I didn't ask you.

181
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
You can compare the amount, right?

182
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Why do you compare?

183
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Why do you compare the amount?

184
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I ordered the same thing, so I thought the amount would be the same.

185
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:46,000
When I checked the amount, it was clearly different.

186
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:53,000
So I didn't ask you why you ordered a large serving.

187
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I was told that I ordered a large serving.

188
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:04,000
You ordered a large serving, so the amount is different.

189
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I think the VTR is a little too much.

190
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Actually, I ordered the same amount.

191
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I didn't order a large serving.

192
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
You ordered a large serving.

193
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I ordered the same amount.

194
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,000
You ordered a large serving, so the amount is different.

195
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Please stop the roux.

196
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Why do you do that?

197
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
It's strange to see it like this.

198
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
It's strange.

199
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
It's a habit.

200
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Habit?

201
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,000
The person who ordered the large serving has more rice than usual.

202
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
This is natural.

203
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
There is a lot of roux.

204
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
That's right.

205
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
So you can eat it deliciously.

206
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
If you remove the roux, there is a lot of rice left.

207
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
That's right.

208
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
The roux.

209
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I see.

210
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I don't think that's the case.

211
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I don't think that's the case.

212
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
That was a good sound.

213
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I have evidence that the large serving is a fake.

214
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Let's take a look.

215
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
This is a kid's hat.

216
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Do you know this?

217
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I made this four years ago.

218
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
At that time, the large serving was not a kid's hat.

219
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Why is that?

220
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
There is a reason for this.

221
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:28,000
At that time, I was working with the Invention Shogun.

222
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,000
We were in the same family.

223
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Did you hear that?

224
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
What is it?

225
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
There is a strange English word.

226
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Where did you get it from?

227
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
The staff room.

228
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Which staff room?

229
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
There is a staff room for the Invention Shogun and the kid's hat.

230
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
The same staff room?

231
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Yes.

232
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
There?

233
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
There.

234
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
This?

235
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I put it there.

236
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
You put it there?

237
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
That's strange.

238
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Where did you put it?

239
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Did you put it in a bag?

240
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
No.

241
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I put it in a cardboard box.

242
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Last time, I stole a lunch box from someone's show.

243
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I'm scared.

244
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
My fingers are going to bend.

245
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Let's stop.

246
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Here is the evidence that this guy is the most stingy.

247
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
This is a cell phone.

248
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:36,000
It's been 11 digits for four months, but it's still a 10-digit number.

249
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I don't need it, so I can't change it.

250
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
That's right.

251
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Even when I call, the 030 number comes up, right?

252
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I look at it, pick up the phone on the desk, fix it to 090, and call.

253
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
That's amazing.

254
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
It's an amazing first aid bag.

255
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I've been using this for almost a year, but the cumulative fee is 33,000 yen.

256
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
What?

257
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
In a year?

258
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
What?

259
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
It's 33,000 yen in a year?

260
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I've only been using it for 33,000 yen.

261
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
This is Mago-gyaru.

262
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Mago-gyaru?

263
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Is that it?

264
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
What do you do with your phone?

265
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Do you have it?

266
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I don't think I have a tele-card.

267
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
This is the evidence.

268
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
You wrote it well.

269
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
This is also evidence.

270
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
This is evidence.

271
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I knew it.

272
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Wait a minute.

273
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
That's all you say.

274
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Isn't this Amex's gold card?

275
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
What's wrong with this?

276
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
This is made by a normal person, right?

277
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Who is it?

278
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
It's mine.

279
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
It says Onuma Akihiro.

280
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,000
What's your gold card?

281
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
It's amazing.

282
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
It's not over yet.

283
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Is there more?

284
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
It's not like this.

285
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Please watch the next video.

286
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,000
One day, the producer...

287
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I'm sorry, but I can't use the taxi ticket anymore.

288
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Please tell everyone.

289
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I understand.

290
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
The producer told the staff.

291
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I'm sorry, but I can't use the taxi ticket anymore.

292
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Please tell everyone.

293
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
It can't be helped.

294
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
The staff agrees that it is due to the influence of the storm in recent years.

295
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I'm sorry, but I can't use the taxi ticket anymore.

296
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Please tell everyone.

297
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
What?

298
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
What do you mean?

299
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
The taxi ticket won't come out.

300
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I'm just telling you what to do.

301
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Please tell the producer.

302
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I'm sorry, but I can't use the taxi ticket anymore.

303
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Please tell everyone.

304
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
It can't be helped.

305
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
It wasn't the producer.

306
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
It was Onuma Akihiro.

307
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
The producer came to him.

308
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Hey, Onuma.

309
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I think you've heard of it.

310
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Please tell everyone about the taxi ticket.

311
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
It's okay.

312
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
It can't be helped.

313
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
It's okay.

314
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
He's a real man.

315
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
He's a real man.

316
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
He's a real man.

317
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Did you meet him?

318
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I saw him.

319
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Please explain.

320
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,000
It wasn't all of them, but some of them were like that.

321
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
It was a contact.

322
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I heard that.

323
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I thought it couldn't be helped.

324
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Only Onuma came to me.

325
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I thought he would come by car.

326
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I told him to drop me off at the parking lot.

327
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I told him to drop me off at the parking lot.

328
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
You're a woman.

329
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I told him to drop me off at the parking lot.

330
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
That's the worst.

331
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Please tell everyone about Onuma's car.

332
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
He doesn't gamble.

333
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
He doesn't gamble.

334
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I told him I was going to start gambling soon.

335
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I told him I bought a horse ticket.

336
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I asked him.

337
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I asked him to buy a horse ticket twice as much as 1.2 times.

338
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I asked him to buy a horse ticket twice as much as 1.2 times.

339
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I'm serious.

340
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I think he bought a copy of the book.

341
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:54,000
The copy of the book is very low.

342
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
It's very hard.

343
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
It's very hard.

344
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I don't want to lose it.

345
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
It's a bad place.

346
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Did you get it?

347
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Thanks to you.

348
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I'm so bad.

349
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I'm so bad.

350
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I'm like a town girl.

351
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
This is the last time.

352
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
This is also human nature.

353
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
There are various things.

354
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Please watch it.

355
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:39,000
One day, a producer came to AD.

356
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Do you want to go golfing next time?

357
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Really? I'll go.

358
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,000
AD was invited to play golf for the first time.

359
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
This is my first time playing golf.

360
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I'll do my best.

361
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:57,000
AD, who doesn't have a golf club, called his parents.

362
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
He borrowed a golf club from his father.

363
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Dad, I'm going to play golf next time.

364
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Can you lend me a golf club?

365
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Are you going to start playing golf?

366
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Then I'll buy you a new golf club.

367
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Really?

368
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:20,000
His father, who was impressed by his son's growth, gave him a golf club as a gift.

369
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
And on the day of golf...

370
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I'll do my best at this new club today.

371
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
And then...

372
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
What is it at a time like this?

373
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Yes, hello.

374
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Hello, it's a big swamp.

375
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
You're free now, right?

376
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I have a problem with my battery.

377
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Please come to the car now.

378
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Now?

379
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
That's right.

380
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
You're free, aren't you?

381
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Be quiet.

382
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Wait a minute.

383
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I don't know if I can make it in time for golf.

384
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:09,000
AD went to the scene without being disobeyed by his seniors.

385
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Thank you for waiting, Onuma.

386
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
It's too late.

387
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Hurry up and connect the battery.

388
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
I'm in a hurry.

389
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:22,000
But the battery size is different between Onuma's Benz and my car.

390
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I can't do it.

391
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
It's okay.

392
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
But I think it's better to call Jaff.

393
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Shut up.

394
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
If you call him, he'll pay.

395
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Hurry up.

396
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Onuma can't help but connect the battery.

397
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Look, it's working.

398
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
I'm in a hurry.

399
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
See you later.

400
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
But I'll make it in time for golf.

401
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:00,000
AD looks at Onuma and hurries to golf.

402
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
But...

403
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
What?

404
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
The engine doesn't start.

405
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
I can't go to golf with this.

406
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
In the end, AD left the car on the road.

407
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
He gave up golf and took a taxi home.

408
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
And the next day, he went to pick up his car.

409
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
What?

410
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
There's no car.

411
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,000
The car was damaged.

412
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:33,000
AD couldn't go to the golf he was looking forward to.

413
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
What should I do?

414
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:40,000
AD called Onuma and explained the situation.

415
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Then...

416
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I understand the situation, but is it my fault?

417
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:50,000
You're not going to take money from me, are you?

418
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
What?

419
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
This is a big problem.

420
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
This is...

421
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Here you are.

422
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
This is your compensation.

423
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Please.

424
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
The car repair fee.

425
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
The battery is gone.

426
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
I bought it for 40,000 yen.

427
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,000
This is a fine for parking.

428
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
15,000 yen.

429
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
This is 84,000 yen.

430
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:26,000
I bought it because I wanted my car to have a good battery.

431
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
I want my car to have a good battery.

432
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
What do you think?

433
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Did you buy the battery?

434
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Did you buy it?

435
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
No, I didn't buy it.

436
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
You didn't buy it?

437
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Why are you lying?

438
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Why are you lying?

439
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
You'll find out soon.

440
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
You'll find out soon.

441
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
What do you think?

442
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I didn't buy it.

443
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
You're lying.

444
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
I bought it for you.

445
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
You're lying.

446
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
You're lying.

447
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,000
You spent almost 100,000 yen.

448
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:13,000
I went to the scene.

449
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
The situation after that...

450
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Why were you in such a hurry?

451
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
I went shopping.

452
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:26,000
That was the last thing I bought.

453
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
That's a bargain.

454
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Is that a bargain?

455
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Did you want to bargain?

456
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
That's terrible.

457
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
You're amazing.

458
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
This is not a burden.

459
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,000
I don't think it's a burden.

460
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
It's worse than last time.

461
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
My heart is broken.

462
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
This is a serious matter.

463
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
That's all.

464
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Please go to another room.

465
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:12,000
There's no point in going to another room.
