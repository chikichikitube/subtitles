1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
What the hell is this?

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
It's the first episode of Gaki no Tsukai Arahen!

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
It's the first episode of Gaki no Tsukai Arahen!

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
It's a shocking special!

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Tsukitsuki! This is the world's magic!

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Today, we have a special guest from China.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Let's introduce him right away.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Sensei, please!

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Nice to meet you.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Yes, I'm fine.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
You're fine?

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Yes, I'm fine.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Your nose is dripping.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Yes, the studio was hot.

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
After eating hot food, my nose comes out.

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I think that's how it is.

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I see.

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I've never seen your magic before.

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Oh, really?

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I want to see it.

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The one on the grass wall.

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
What?

23
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Is it called the grass wall?

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
It's called the grass wall Akira.

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
From China?

26
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Yes.

27
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Aren't you alone today?

28
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I brought my student today.

29
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
What is this?

30
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
It has something to do with magic, doesn't it?

31
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
What do you call it?

32
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
It's a part of your clothes.

33
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
A part?

34
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Yes, a part.

35
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Then, let's get started.

36
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
For example, like this.

37
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Yes.

38
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Wonderful!

39
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Are you angry?

40
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
No.

41
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Wonderful!

42
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
What?

43
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
No, are you angry?

44
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Next.

45
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Next, this girl.

46
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Yes.

47
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
What do you call it?

48
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
She's doing a human pump.

49
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Yes.

50
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
That's what she's doing.

51
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
What do you call this person?

52
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
What do you call her?

53
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
It's Fujiyama.

54
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
It's Fujiyama.

55
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Fujiyama is a goldfish.

56
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
What?

57
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I'll challenge him.

58
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Is this a good idea?

59
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
No, no.

60
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
It's Fujiyama.

61
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
It's okay, it's okay.

62
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
You're taking off your clothes, aren't you?

63
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Yes.

64
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
You look like a goldfish.

65
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Yes.

66
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Let's see the inside of your mouth.

67
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Look.

68
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
It's not there, is it?

69
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
It's not there, is it?

70
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
It's not there, is it?

71
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
It's not there.

72
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Ah!

73
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Ah!

74
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Oh!

75
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Right?

76
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Okay, next.

77
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Okay, next is me.

78
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
What?

79
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
It's me again.

80
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Oh!

81
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Stop looking at me.

82
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Next.

83
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Yes.

84
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
My favorite disciple.

85
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
This person?

86
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Hirose.

87
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
This person is Hirose.

88
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Yes.

89
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I'll put Hirose inside.

90
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Yes.

91
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I'll put Hirose inside.

92
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Yes.

93
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Oh, I see.

94
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Next.

95
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
It's a little difficult.

96
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Yes.

97
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
You're going to cover it up, right?

98
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Yes.

99
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
What are you doing?

100
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
It's okay.

101
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I'll raise it a little.

102
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Ah!

103
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Ah!

104
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
It hurts.

105
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Ah!

106
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
It went in.

107
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Now.

108
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
This is the main thing.

109
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Yes.

110
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I'll go.

111
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Yes.

112
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Oh!

113
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Oh!

114
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
So it doesn't hurt at all!

115
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Oh!

116
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Okay.

117
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Wait!

118
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Wait a minute!

119
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
What's wrong with you!

120
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
It hurts so much!

121
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
No, no, no.

122
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
It hurts!

123
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
You're saying it hurts!

124
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
No, no, no.

125
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
It doesn't hurt at all.

126
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I just feel like it hurts.

127
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Hirose says it doesn't hurt.

128
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
That's great!

129
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Now let's put it back.

130
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Yes.

131
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
It's okay.

132
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Anybody can do that.

133
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Really?

134
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Didn't know I could do it inside.

135
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Even though you have to be at least someone like me.

136
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Really?

137
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
If so, will you join?

138
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Well, I don't think I can do it myself.

139
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
What do you mean?

140
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Please

141
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
It's fine, I'm the host

142
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
No, no, it's fine

143
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Eh?

144
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
It's fine

145
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
No, no, seriously

146
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
It's fine

147
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
No, it's not fine at all

148
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I don't understand anything

149
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
No, no, it's fine

150
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
No

151
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
No, what are you talking about?

152
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
No, no, no

153
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Let's go

154
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Eh?

155
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
What are you going to do?

156
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
What are you going to do?

157
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Eh?

158
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
See, I got it

159
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I finally got the hang of it

160
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
What are you doing?

161
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
It's fine, right?

162
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I'm going

163
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
What are you going to do?

164
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
No, no, I'm going to move it

165
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Are you okay?

166
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Yes

167
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Go

168
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Put your hand in

169
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Eh?

170
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Eh?

171
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
The funny thing is that you can go a little more

172
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Yes, yes, yes, yes

173
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
It hurts

174
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Yes

175
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:44,000
The funny thing is that you can go a little more

176
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Ladies and gentlemen

177
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Thank you

178
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Now

179
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Let's move on to the next one

180
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
It's already over

181
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I don't like this hall

182
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
It's like a bomb explosion

183
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
It's like a bomb explosion

184
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I told you

185
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
What kind of hall is this?

186
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Kanda Pance Hall

187
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Kanda Pance

188
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
What are you doing?

189
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
What is Kanda Pance?

190
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
What does it mean?

191
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I don't understand

192
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
How do you decide the name?

193
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I don't know

194
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I understand

195
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,000
If you think of something dirty in an apartment, it's like a play hub

196
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
There's something like a Maison

197
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
It's attached

198
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
It's hard

199
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
It's attached

200
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Even though it's a wooden building

201
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Yes, yes, yes

202
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
What is it?

203
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Grand Topia or something like that

204
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I don't know

205
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Well

206
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
It was in the opening of this program

207
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
The dirty part of Yamasaki

208
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
What is that?

209
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Put four sheets of wood together

210
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Yes, yes, yes

211
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
That's it

212
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Yes, yes

213
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
What is that?

214
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
When you open the door, the car is running

215
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Yes, yes, yes

216
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
It will be completed in half a day

217
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
What is it?

218
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
It's attached

219
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Soreng

220
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Soreng

221
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
It's completely different

222
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
It's not like that

223
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Soreng

224
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
It's strange

225
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
How to name it

226
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
It's because of the title of the program

227
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
It's a lot of trouble

228
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Yes, yes, yes

229
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
What should I do for the next new program?

230
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I have to think of a lot of titles

231
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Let's make a good country, Downtown

232
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
What is that?

233
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Everyone will say

234
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Soreng

235
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Nakamatsu is a fool

236
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Yes, yes, yes

237
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Yes

238
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
The boy's oath

239
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Someone decided this on their own, right?

240
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
It's like we said it well

241
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
In the story

242
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I said it as it is

243
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Someone must have thought of a way

244
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
The boy's oath

245
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I don't really like the title of Osaka-ben

246
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Really?

247
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
The intonation is

248
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I say the boy's oath

249
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Did you see the boy's oath yesterday?

250
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
That's what they say

251
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
That's why it's better to be different

252
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
What do you think of Osaka-ben?

253
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Is that so?

254
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
We used to have a tour

255
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
We had a tour

256
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Really

257
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
You guys are crazy

258
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Ah

259
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I laughed

260
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I'm really good at singing

261
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
It's true

262
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
We appear as a silhouette

263
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
In the intonation

264
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Yes, yes

265
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
We break it and come out

266
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Ah, I can't do it

267
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I don't believe it

268
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
It's true

269
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I don't know

270
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
You know it, right?

271
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
You went there, right?

272
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Yes, yes

273
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
At that time, the tour

274
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Downtown 78

275
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
The title of the tour

276
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
It was a big hit

277
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Yes, yes

278
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
The subtitle was

279
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I won't apologize

280
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
It fell down

281
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Boo

282
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Yes

283
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
From now on

284
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Downtown tour 89

285
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I won't apologize

286
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
It's cool

287
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
It's cool

288
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
It's cool

289
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
So we need to think about the title

290
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I won't say that I'm going home

291
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I won't say that I'm going home

292
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
But it's shocking

293
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
It's shocking

294
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
How is it?

295
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Recently

296
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Well

297
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I'm tired

298
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I'm tired

299
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
What?

300
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Oh

301
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Confirmed value

302
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
But it's like that

303
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
From next year

304
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Even if you work harder

305
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
It's the same

306
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Why?

307
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I'll take all the tax

308
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Oh

309
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Oh yes

310
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Recently

311
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
There is a common person

312
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Common people

313
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Comedians

314
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
They think it's cheap

315
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Is this a good or bad story?

316
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Oh yes

317
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
They think it's cheap

318
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Really

319
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
They think it's cheap

320
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
So next year

321
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Maybe

322
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I don't think I can earn a million

323
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Oh

324
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Yes

325
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
See, I'm tired

326
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
That means you have more than a million

327
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I have

328
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I have

329
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Right?

330
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Oh

331
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
So if you think about it

332
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Comedians are looking down on you

333
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
It's cheap

334
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Then

335
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I wonder if I can do a kick-off

336
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Well, that's right

337
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I don't think I can do this

338
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I don't think I can earn 300 million

339
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
If you can earn that much

340
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
If you can earn that much

341
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I'll give you more

342
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
If I can earn 300 million

343
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
What?

344
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I'll do it with a tank top

345
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I don't know what it is

346
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
What?

347
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I don't know

348
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
No

349
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Why do you earn so much money with a tank top?

350
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
No

351
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
So

352
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Sweating

353
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Oh

354
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I sweat that much

355
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I put a towel on my shoulder

356
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I'll do it while I'm sweating

357
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I'll do that much

358
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Yes

359
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
That's it

360
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
That's it

361
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
You'll understand if you do that

362
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
It doesn't cost much

363
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Yes

364
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
That's right

365
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
It doesn't cost more than that

366
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
People think it's really cheap

367
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Oh

368
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Yes

369
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I'm the top baseball player

370
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
But there are comedians who have more money than I do

371
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Yes

372
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
There are

373
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Really

374
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
That's right

375
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
You guys look down on comedians

376
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
You guys think about it

377
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
What's that?

378
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
A pig's wakataka or something

379
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I've seen that before

380
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
What's that?

381
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
It's a pig

382
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I can throw it

383
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
It's a pig

384
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
What?

385
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
What's so bad?

386
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I'm not like my brother

387
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
What's so bad?

388
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Wakataka Fever

389
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
What's that?

390
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Come on

391
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I don't know

392
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I don't know

393
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I don't know

394
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I don't know

395
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Right?

396
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Well

397
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
My team's Yamazaki says

398
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Wakataka is expensive

399
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
You can do whatever you want

400
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
There's no woman who won't do it

401
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
There is

402
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
If you ask him

403
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
He says he can do 100 out of 100

404
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
He can do it

405
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Yes

406
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
There are people who like fat people

407
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
And people who don't like me

408
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
He's a guy who's married to a girl

409
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
He's crazy

410
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
But the worst thing I've seen in my wife's team is

411
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,000
F***

412
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
This is

413
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,000
The Gorilla Man

414
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
That's really

415
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Hey

416
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Seriously

417
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I was surprised

418
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
The wide show

419
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
The wide show

420
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I was surprised when I saw the Gorilla Man

421
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I was surprised

422
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
You're laughing

423
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:15,000
It's my wedding ring

424
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
The Gorilla Man

425
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
He's sweating

426
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
It's dirty

427
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:32,000
It's dirty

428
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
It's terrible

429
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
It's terrible

430
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Who's the Gorilla Man?

431
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Hey

432
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
It's terrible

433
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
TV is for celebrities

434
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Well

435
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
You can't say bad things

436
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I can't

437
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
He's always like that

438
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
He's a skater

439
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
F***

440
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
It's terrible

441
00:13:53,000 --> 00:14:01,000
It's too red here

442
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
It's terrible

443
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
He's desperate

444
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
He's desperate

445
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Well

446
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
The accelerator

447
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Yes

448
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
The triple accelerator

449
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
The triple

450
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
What?

451
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
The triple

452
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
He gave up the triple accelerator

453
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
He gave up

454
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Because he's bad

455
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
If he wants to fail, he can

456
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Yes

457
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
He's desperate

458
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:25,000
He's like this

459
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
He's not burning

460
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
He's not burning

461
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
He's not burning

462
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
He's desperate

463
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I don't know what he's thinking

464
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
He's doing something with a long mouth and an umbrella

465
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:40,000
He's doing something

466
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
It's red here

467
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Who's the bad guy?

468
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
The other day, there was a beautiful girl

469
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
She was so ugly

470
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
She was like, you can't say beautiful things

471
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
She was doing something like this

472
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
She was doing something like this

473
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:06,000
She was doing something like this

474
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
And

475
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Next to the screen, there was a beautiful girl

476
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Yes

477
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
But

478
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I still can't talk to Gorilla Man

479
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
You can't

480
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Gorilla Man is a gorilla

481
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
He was doing badminton

482
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
He was doing badminton

483
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:28,000
What did he look like?

484
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Next

485
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
This is sudden, but please listen

486
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
After watching this program

487
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I think it was when I was sleeping

488
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I was talking in my sleep

489
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
And in a loud voice

490
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
What?

491
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
What?

492
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I was saying

493
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
When I heard this from my sleep

494
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
It was about me

495
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
But I laughed

496
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Do you talk in your sleep?

497
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
No, I don't

498
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
But I talk in my sleep

499
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
He talks in his sleep

500
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
He really talks in his sleep

501
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I don't know what he's talking about

502
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
He talks in his sleep

503
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
He talks in his sleep

504
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
What?

505
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
He talks in his sleep

506
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I don't talk in my sleep

507
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
But I've heard it before

508
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
When I was sleeping with you

509
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Really?

510
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Really

511
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I used to talk in my sleep a lot

512
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I don't know now

513
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I don't go to a love hotel with you as much as I used to

514
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I don't know

515
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
But you should get rid of badminton

516
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I heard that I couldn't sleep until the morning

517
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
You couldn't sleep until the morning

518
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I thought I could sleep

519
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
If you get rid of badminton in the morning

520
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
He won't wake you up

521
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
He'll wake you up

522
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Wake up

523
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
If you eat a lot and go to sleep, you'll become a cow

524
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
If you eat while sleeping, what will you become?

525
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
That's a difficult question

526
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Let's think about it together

527
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Let's go

528
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
One, two, three, four

529
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
He says he'll become a cow

530
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I wonder why

531
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I wonder why

532
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
When I was a kid

533
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I didn't think I'd become a cow

534
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I was really scared when I was a kid

535
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I heard that if you blow a whistle, a snake will come out

536
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I heard that if you pull a string, your fingers will bend

537
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Really?

538
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I thought I'd become a cow

539
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I thought I'd become a cow

540
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
This is hard

541
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
It's not a good thing

542
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I thought I'd become a cow

543
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I was scared of that

544
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
This is my question

545
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
What will you become?

546
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I have another question

547
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I'll ask this in parallel

548
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,000
How does a shellfish feel when it spits out sand?

549
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
These two questions

550
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
How does a shellfish feel when it spits out sand?

551
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:54,000
A shellfish doesn't do anything bad

552
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:00,000
A shellfish doesn't do anything bad

553
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
It's just that it's in the water

554
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
It's just that it's in the water

555
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
For example, in winter the shellfish gets freed

556
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Remember when it got thrown into the

557
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Karate style linear K ela

558
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
That's it

559
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
A fisherman comes to the range

560
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
And they hit it

561
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
It's the triple kick

562
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Then someone else comes

563
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Then he throws it into the mountain

564
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:08,000
He does that

565
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:28,000
It goes into the shellfish

566
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:28,960
Then he throws it into the landing

567
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,000
With these kinds of shells

568
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I feel like I'm going to puke.

569
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Are you okay? Can you fight?

570
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I'll do my best. I'll do my best.

571
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
That's difficult.

572
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
What happens if you eat while you're sleeping?

573
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
What happens if I eat while I'm sleeping?

574
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
After you eat...

575
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
What happens if I eat while I'm sleeping?

576
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
What happens if I eat while I'm sleeping?

577
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
There's a song about eating while you're sleeping.

578
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,000
What happens if I eat while I'm sleeping?

579
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
You can't do that if you rest.

580
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Hey, don't be so stubborn and sing!

581
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
What happens if I eat while I'm sleeping?

582
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
What happens if I eat while I'm sleeping?

583
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
That's right. You eat while you're sleeping.

584
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
What happens if I eat while I'm sleeping?

585
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
What does that mean?

586
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
What happens?

587
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
You'll be full at night.

588
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Then, what happens if I eat while I'm sleeping?

589
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
That's tough.

590
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
What happens?

591
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
You can eat while you're sleeping.

592
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
You can't?

593
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
You'll be fat.

594
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
You'll be fat, but you'll be a pig.

595
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,000
And after you eat, you'll be a cow.

596
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
You're getting close.

597
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
You're getting close.

598
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
The problem is...

599
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:18,000
What happens if I eat while I'm sleeping?

600
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
You're getting close.

601
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I'm getting close?

602
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
You're getting close?

603
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
You're getting close?

604
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
You eat while you're sleeping, right?

605
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Yes.

606
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
You're not a sleepwalking old man.

607
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
That's right.

608
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
What?

609
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Let's go home.

610
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Let's put this away for now.

611
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Let's put this away.

612
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Why are female comedians so ugly?

613
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Female comedians are ugly and smelly.

614
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I don't understand that.

615
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I don't know that story.

616
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Whose story is it?

617
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
It's called Double Sakuranbo.

618
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Do you know it?

619
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
It's really smelly.

620
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,000
I was really tired from work.

621
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I had to go to the dressing room.

622
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
The dressing room was full of water.

623
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
And my nose...

624
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
It was really smelly.

625
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
I woke up and it was really smelly.

626
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
What?

627
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I looked around.

628
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I saw Double Sakuranbo's high heels.

629
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:50,000
I got closer and my nose...

630
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
I didn't know that.

631
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Do you know that my feet don't stink at all?

632
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I don't know that.

633
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Your feet don't stink.

634
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
They don't stink!

635
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Let's put this away for now.

636
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
It stinks!

637
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Let's put this away.

638
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Let's put this away!

639
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:35,000
It stinks!
