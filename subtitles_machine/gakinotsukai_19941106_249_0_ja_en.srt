1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
In the first episode, we're going to measure Mr. Matsumoto as a sudden entertainer!

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Mr. Matsumoto!

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Yes, yes.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Finally, the day has come.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Well, no one has done it on TV before.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
No one has done it before.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
We're going to measure various entertainers today.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Mr. Matsumoto, it's your first time, isn't it?

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Well, even if you call me an entertainer, I've gathered a lot of big people today.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Well, I've heard a lot of things like how many entertainers you've cut down.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
That's right.

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I don't know if that's really worth it.

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Yes.

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
We're going to show it on TV for the first time.

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Are you going to show it?

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Yes, we're going to show it.

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Oh, are you going to quit?

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
No, we're going to show it.

19
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Oh, I see.

20
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Mr. Matsumoto, please come over here.

21
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Yes, yes.

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Please come over here.

23
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
This program is brought to you by the sponsor you are watching.

24
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Does anyone know?

25
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Well, my machine has been studied.

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Who is it?

27
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Professor, Sumi is here.

28
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Let him sit down.

29
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Sumi, sit down.

30
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Professor, is this the machine?

31
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
This is the machine.

32
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Now, let's take a look.

33
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Please sit down here.

34
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Let's go.

35
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Professor, I have a question for you.

36
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Answer it with yes or no.

37
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Yes.

38
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Baseball is a pitcher, but at night it's a batter.

39
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Yes.

40
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Okay.

41
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Throwing is left-handed, but at that time it's right-handed.

42
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
No.

43
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
That's left-handed.

44
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
At that time, it's left-handed.

45
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Okay.

46
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
It's out.

47
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
It's out.

48
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Yes.

49
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Professor, what does this mean?

50
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
What is it?

51
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
This is my meal today.

52
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Whose meal is that?

53
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
This is what it means.

54
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Sumi's meal is thick.

55
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Yes.

56
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
It's thick.

57
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Don't complain if it's this much.

58
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
What is it?

59
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Is it this thick?

60
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Professor, this is impossible.

61
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
This is what it means.

62
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
This is what I expected.

63
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
It's a little thicker.

64
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Thicker?

65
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
This side.

66
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
This side?

67
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
This side is a little thin.

68
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I see.

69
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I see.

70
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
But it's amazing.

71
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Sumi's meal is this thick.

72
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
This is amazing.

73
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
You must have said that a lot.

74
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
You must have done a lot of things when you were an actor.

75
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Is there a sports player like this?

76
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
This is a little out.

77
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
It's out.

78
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
A yellow thing is out.

79
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Hamada-kun.

80
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Yes.

81
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Next patient.

82
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Here he is.

83
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Professor.

84
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Dr. Taka.

85
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Come here.

86
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
What are you doing?

87
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Come here.

88
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I'm not laughing.

89
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Please sit down.

90
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Sometimes I step on my own balls.

91
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Is it that dangerous?

92
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Sometimes it's dangerous.

93
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
It's a little out.

94
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Answer with yes or no.

95
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
No.

96
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
It's no.

97
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I often get beaten down by women.

98
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
You have to answer honestly.

99
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Next patient.

100
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Yes.

101
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I'm the type to blow first.

102
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I see.

103
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
If you sleep with me, you'll be in trouble.

104
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
The data is out.

105
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Let's go.

106
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Taka's meal is this.

107
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
What is this?

108
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
It's small.

109
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Is it a snack?

110
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
It's not reliable.

111
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
And it's sticky.

112
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Is it this?

113
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I'm not satisfied with this.

114
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
It's rude on TV.

115
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Don't you have a measure?

116
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I don't have a measure.

117
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I really want to compare.

118
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
This is normal.

119
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
This is normal?

120
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
This is normal.

121
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I see.

122
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I don't know the rest.

123
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Do you want to measure it?

124
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
It looks like this.

125
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
And it's getting shorter.

126
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Do you want to do it?

127
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Don't call me.

128
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I'm being called.

129
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Hey.

130
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Get up.

131
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Get up.

132
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I don't want to work.

133
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I don't want to work.

134
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I don't want to work.

135
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I'll give you back your word.

136
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Don't film me.

137
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I'm working with you.

138
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
It's the same.

139
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I'm working with you.

140
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Come here.

141
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
What?

142
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
You have to have a word.

143
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Why am I here?

144
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
You have to have a word.

145
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I'm an electrical engineer.

146
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Don't talk.

147
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Sit down.

148
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Wait.

149
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Wait.

150
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Look at it for the future.

151
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I'll measure it.

152
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Why do you have to measure it?

153
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Sit down.

154
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
This is a new show.

155
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
It's not a new show.

156
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
First question.

157
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Have you ever floated while standing?

158
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Yes.

159
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
You're lying.

160
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
You're lying.

161
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
You'll float tomorrow.

162
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I've been in the air before.

163
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I see.

164
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
What is this?

165
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
This is a yes or no.

166
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
It's an input.

167
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Where are these connected?

168
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Here.

169
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
It's noisy.

170
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Next question.

171
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
My wife has become a big fan lately.

172
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Yes.

173
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Really?

174
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
It's not a big deal.

175
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
It's not a big deal.

176
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
When I was a kid, I hid in my house.

177
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Why?

178
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Yes.

179
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Stop it.

180
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
It's a yes or no.

181
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
It's a yes or no.

182
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
It's a yes or no.

183
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
It's a yes or no.

184
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Okay.

185
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Wait a minute.

186
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
There's a hole in the meter.

187
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
It's from the east.

188
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
What is this?

189
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
It's a big one.

190
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Nice.

191
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
It's disgusting.

192
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
It's a windbreaker.

193
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
You're throwing it out.

194
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
What the hell are you talking about?

195
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
What the hell are you talking about?

196
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I'm talking about the white one

197
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Are you stupid?

198
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
What the hell is this?

199
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Is this me?

200
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Hey, it's not that big

201
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I said it floated when I touched it

202
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,000
It floated, but it's not that big

203
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
It's not that big

204
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I know it's different from this

205
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I'm busy now

206
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I'm sorry

207
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Let's do this like this

208
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Let's do this like this

209
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Can we do this like this?

210
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Like this

211
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Excuse me, what is this?

212
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
What the hell is this?

213
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Ladies and gentlemen

214
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
We have to get out of this hall by 10 o'clock

215
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
What time is it?

216
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
It's set until 10 o'clock

217
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
So it's 10 o'clock including departure?

218
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I don't know

219
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
We have to go home

220
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I'm sorry

221
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
The light of the firefly is flowing

222
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I have a manager

223
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
His name is Tsukimura

224
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
He's a little crazy

225
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
He can speak English

226
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Tsukimura is really crazy

227
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
He's really crazy

228
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Sometimes he gets angry by himself

229
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
He says to himself

230
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Why didn't I get angry?

231
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I'm still immature

232
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
He can speak English

233
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
He says it in English

234
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Cool

235
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
It's so scary

236
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Cool

237
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I had a meeting the other day

238
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:28,000
When I went to the restaurant, the car had stopped, so I couldn't stop the car.

239
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:34,000
There was a couple trying to get out, so I told them to hurry up.

240
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Then the man of the couple came down and said,

241
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
What do you mean?

242
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
It's natural for you to do that.

243
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
He kept complaining.

244
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Is Tsukimura weak when he complains?

245
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I'm sorry.

246
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Did you apologize?

247
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I'm sorry.

248
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
After that, Okamoto came.

249
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
He's the chief, so he kept complaining.

250
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
The man of the couple didn't try to get out.

251
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I got on the car and said,

252
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Okamoto has to do something about this situation.

253
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
What do you think?

254
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Okamoto is in pain, too.

255
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I was watching it like this.

256
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,000
What kind of ending will this story have?

257
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Okamoto suddenly got angry.

258
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
He wanted to hit the man.

259
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Tsukimura is a fool.

260
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I'm sorry.

261
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
The man of the couple said,

262
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
That's enough.

263
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Okamoto is good.

264
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
On the contrary, if you hit your man,

265
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Can't you tell him to stop?

266
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I don't know if it's all his calculation.

267
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
You did that crying bag.

268
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I said, that's enough.

269
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I cried like that.

270
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
The cause is Tsukimura.

271
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Yesterday, CX and I finished the studio.

272
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I was walking around the hallway.

273
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I was jumping on both sides.

274
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Tsukimura said, GAN!

275
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I said, GAN!

276
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I was walking normally.

277
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I didn't hit the panel.

278
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I was like this.

279
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Tsukimura said, GAN!

280
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I didn't know what was going on.

281
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Okamoto was waiting in front of me.

282
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I said, Okamoto.

283
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:43,000
They're crazy.

284
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Let's go home.

285
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Why did you listen to Tsukimura?

286
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
It's not Tsukimura.

287
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I don't care what kind of guy Tsukimura is.

288
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
What?

289
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
What are you?

290
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
What are you?

291
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I'm downtown.

292
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
What about you?

293
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I'm downtown.

294
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I've never seen you.

295
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I see you sometimes.

296
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I'm on TV a lot.

297
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
You're on TV?

298
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Yes.

299
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
You're dressed well.

300
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I can't beat your necktie.

301
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
It's a bit wild.

302
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:34,000
It's loose.

303
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
It's a bit wild.

304
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I don't want to be wild.

305
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
It's natural.

306
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Wow.

307
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Really?

308
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Yes.

309
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I don't like tight pants.

310
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I used to like them.

311
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
But I don't like them anymore.

312
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,000
This is fashion.

313
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Are you wearing them?

314
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Of course.

315
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
It's fashionable.

316
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I see.

317
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I'll go like this.

318
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
What?

319
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Are you going to do it?

320
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I told you.

321
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Let's go to the post office.

322
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Let's go to the post office.

323
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Matsumoto, you often say that Hamada's armpit stinks.

324
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Why?

325
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I don't say that often.

326
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Tell me what it smells like.

327
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I think it's Hamada's armpit.

328
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I don't have an armpit.

329
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:54,000
It's not that bad.

330
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
There's nothing wrong with an armpit.

331
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Close your eyes.

332
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Think of the most smelly thing you can think of.

333
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Did you think of it?

334
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I think it's 45 times more than that.

335
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I thought so.

336
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I thought it would be twice as bad.

337
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
This is Hamada's armpit.

338
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Nice to meet you.

339
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
No, it's not that.

340
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
He said it's my armpit.

341
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
He often says that it stinks.

342
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
He just says it.

343
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Have you ever said that my armpit stinks?

344
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Yes, I have.

345
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I don't know.

346
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I'm disappointed.

347
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I was told that by my partner.

348
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I always say that my armpit stinks.

349
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Say it properly.

350
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Wait a minute.

351
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
If you raise your armpit, it will roll down.

352
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
It's boring.

353
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Overaction.

354
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Don't say that.

355
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I just said it.

356
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Don't go that far.

357
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Don't do that.

358
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
You are a real asshole.

359
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Have you ever said that my armpit stinks?

360
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Don't say that.

361
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:36,000
This is also a part that hurts my armpit.

362
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Where does this smell?

363
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:45,000
It stinks.

364
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Please tell me how to do it without hurting it.

365
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I see.

366
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,000
You don't have to say that.

367
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:02,000
What do you do if you don't want to get hurt?

368
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:11,000
There is a sound wave that humans can't hear.

369
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
It's above the sound wave.

370
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:22,000
There are people who laugh at the sound wave.

371
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:28,000
At this time, the sound wave is coming.

372
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:36,000
If you are nearby, the sound wave is coming.

373
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Lower the sound a little.

374
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Do you understand?

375
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I will tell you whether you can hear it or not.

376
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
For example, we are talking.

377
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,000
What did you eat last night?

378
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,000
You have to talk to me.

379
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I'm telling you to talk.

380
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
What did you eat last night?

381
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I ate curry.

382
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
You like curry.

383
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Do you go to Egypt?

384
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,000
That will hurt you.

385
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I said it clearly.

386
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I heard it clearly.

387
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,000
It's a little unpleasant.

388
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,000
It's a little unpleasant.

389
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Do you often watch dramas?

390
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:40,000
It's fun.

391
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I can't hear it.

392
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
You can't hear it.

393
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
You can't hear it.

394
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
You can't hear it.

395
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,000
You can't hear it.

396
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Do you often go shopping?

397
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I go sometimes.

398
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Are you okay?

399
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:17,000
You will be told.

400
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:23,000
If you hear it, you will be beaten.

401
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,000
How can I go to the second round after the first round?

402
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I don't know.

403
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:39,000
After the first round, I take a break.

404
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:45,000
What should I do when I challenge again?

405
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:51,000
What are you doing?

406
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Do you smoke?

407
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I smoke.

408
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
It was very intense.

409
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I smoke.

410
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
You sweat a lot.

411
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Of course I smoke.

412
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I'm a smoker.

413
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
What?

414
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
That's enough.

415
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
What are you doing?

416
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I smoke.

417
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:26,000
What are you doing with that ugly woman?

418
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,000
That ugly woman is sleeping next to me.

419
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
You are ugly.

420
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Wait a minute.

421
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
I'm just sleeping.

422
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I'm sleeping.

423
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
What are you going to do?

424
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:44,000
I'm sleeping next to you.

425
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,000
I smoke.

426
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Are you naked?

427
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Is there anyone who wears clothes cleanly after the first round?

428
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,000
You can wear clothes cleanly, but you have to wear underwear.

429
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I don't care if I'm naked.

430
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
You are cool.

431
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I'm a little excited.

432
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
You are like a poppy.

433
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
What is a poppy?

434
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
It's a compliment.

435
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I'm glad.

436
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Thank you for the title.

437
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I have a good example.

438
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,000
I put a cigarette in front of me.

439
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
I can smoke.

440
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:37,000
That's not true.

441
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:42,000
You know that, so you don't smoke.

442
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:47,000
In a different sense, the two of you are burning.

443
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
That's not true.

444
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
You really don't know.

445
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
I'm sorry.

446
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
You smoke.

447
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I'm glad.

448
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
I'm scared.

449
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:16,000
You have to take care of yourself.

450
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Why are you so arrogant?

451
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
He likes me.

452
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,000
I'm your ugly woman now.

453
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
I'm lucky.

454
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
11.53

455
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
11.53?

456
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Let's do it again.

457
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,000
When does a woman laugh?

458
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:51,000
For example, young people in their teens and 20s.

459
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:57,000
When they are in their 60s, they laugh like a drifter.

460
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:02,000
They are in their 40s.

461
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Where do they laugh?

462
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Say 40.

463
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:14,000
When they are in their 40s, they laugh.

464
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:24,000
When they are in their 30s, they laugh in their 40s.

465
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,000
You can find out.

466
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
For example, 30.

467
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:37,000
31.

468
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:42,000
32.

469
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,000
What's the difference?

470
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
It's changing.

471
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,000
33.

472
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
What about 32?

473
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
32.

474
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
33.

475
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
It's the same.

476
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
34.

477
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
This is the point.

478
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
34.

479
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:13,000
It's the same.

480
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
It's long.

481
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
35.

482
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Listen to me.

483
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
35.

484
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
35.

485
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Let's do it.

486
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,000
It's the same.

487
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,000
It's the same.

488
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
36.

489
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Listen to me.

490
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
36.

491
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
I can't stop laughing.

492
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
This is the point.

493
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
I can't help it.

494
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
It's like a boomerang.

495
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
37.

496
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
37.

497
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Listen to me.

498
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:04,000
38.

499
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
I can't stop laughing.

500
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
38.

501
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
38.

502
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:17,000
What are you doing?

503
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
It's the same.

504
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:35,000
This program was brought to you by these sponsors.
