1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Today we came to Suidobashi.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
We came here a long time ago, right?

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Yes, it was a great show.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Yes, it was a great show.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
We were judged by such a judge.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I didn't think so.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
From Osaka, I was told that it was a pleasant comedy.

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Oh, down?

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'm fine, I'm fine.

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
What?

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Let's go.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
What do you think of this place?

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
So...

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I think I can hit P-chan with this.

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Who are you?

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Who are you?

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Who are you?

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Who are you?

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Who are you?

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Who are you?

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Today's venue is here, right?

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
No, there's nothing here.

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
This is the front and back.

24
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
This is the back of the stage.

25
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Yes.

26
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Why is this set here?

27
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Why can't I use this?

28
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Why can't I use this?

29
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
What are you talking about?

30
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
What?

31
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Because you're late.

32
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm not late.

33
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
You and I will take 20,000 yen each.

34
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
We're going to buy Nitta's clothes.

35
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Nitta will change his clothes like this.

36
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Nitta will change his clothes like this.

37
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
First of all, what about the clothes you chose?

38
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
What do you think?

39
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Are you laughing?

40
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I'm not laughing.

41
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Next is Matsumoto's.

42
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
This is so funny.

43
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
This was the opening.

44
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
What are you going to do with this?

45
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
What?

46
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I lost my job.

47
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
What?

48
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Tell me.

49
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
It's in my pocket.

50
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
There's still a lot of fun today.

51
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
As you can see from my attitude,

52
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I don't regret it.

53
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Ladies and gentlemen.

54
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Hello.

55
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Hello.

56
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Today is a quiet place.

57
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
That's right.

58
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
It's a family atmosphere.

59
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
As I said before,

60
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I don't have a low budget program.

61
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I don't have enough money.

62
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
That's not true.

63
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
That's not true.

64
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I don't have money.

65
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I don't have enough money.

66
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
What are you talking about?

67
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
You don't have money.

68
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I don't have money.

69
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
You're lying.

70
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
You're lying.

71
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
You're lying.

72
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
The time has changed.

73
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I've been doing this for half a year.

74
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I've been talking about it.

75
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Let's talk about the inside.

76
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Can't you say panpanpan?

77
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I don't say panpanpan every week.

78
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
It can't be helped.

79
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
From now on,

80
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I have to talk about something that everyone will be proud of.

81
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
For example, what does it mean?

82
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
What?

83
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
It's a good story.

84
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
What does it mean?

85
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
It means that Gorbachev has become president.

86
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Everyone knows that.

87
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,000
And then what?

88
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
It's like a cartoon story.

89
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
It's like you're being told what to do by Gorbachev.

90
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
No matter what Gorbachev says.

91
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
That's not true.

92
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
What does Gorbachev say?

93
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:26,000
What do you think about Gorbachev becoming president?

94
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
It's a bad movie.

95
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
That's not true.

96
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Then wait.

97
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
What do you think about Gorbachev becoming president?

98
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
It won't be the same as before.

99
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
What?

100
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I think so, too.

101
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I've been on the bullet train a lot.

102
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
For three hours,

103
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I read books and read newspapers.

104
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I read political articles.

105
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I'm a person who can read.

106
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I don't open my mouth like you do.

107
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I'm not a fool.

108
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I'm not a fool.

109
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I always keep my mouth open.

110
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I always keep my mouth open.

111
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
But your eyes are open when you're sleeping.

112
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Which is more disgusting?

113
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Ask me.

114
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
That's more disgusting.

115
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Why?

116
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I was sleeping and I opened my eyes.

117
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Your mouth is open.

118
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
That's a sign of a fool.

119
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
There are a lot of people who keep their mouths open.

120
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Not just me.

121
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
When I first saw you,

122
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I had a cold.

123
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I have a cold.

124
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
It's transparent.

125
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I'm scared.

126
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Seriously.

127
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
You'll know when you see it.

128
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Are you scared or not?

129
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Why can't I close my mouth?

130
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
It's strange.

131
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
You're the one who's disgusting.

132
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
You're the one who's disgusting.

133
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
That's right.

134
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Because your mouth is open.

135
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Your mouth is open.

136
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Your eyes are open.

137
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
That's right.

138
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
That's right.

139
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Your eyes are open.

140
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
What do you call it?

141
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
It can be a movie.

142
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
It can't be.

143
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
It can't be Zatoichi.

144
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I'm not the one who keeps my mouth open.

145
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
It has nothing to do with Zatoichi.

146
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
It's when I'm sleeping.

147
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I'm scared.

148
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Your brother will wake up in the middle of the night.

149
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Your brother will wake up in the middle of the night.

150
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I'm the only one who keeps my mouth open.

151
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Your whole family keeps their mouth open.

152
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Did you see that?

153
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
My father is sleeping.

154
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I think I've said this before.

155
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
His family has the same face.

156
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
His mouth is open.

157
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
When I saw his family,

158
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
When I saw his family,

159
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I couldn't breathe well.

160
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I couldn't breathe well.

161
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Because your mouth is open.

162
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Because your mouth is open.

163
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
You idiot.

164
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
The air in this room is thin.

165
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Why am I the only one who has thin air?

166
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Why am I the only one who has thin air?

167
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
What are you talking about?

168
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I'll introduce you to your father.

169
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
He's here.

170
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Matsumoto-san.

171
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
His name is Shuko Wada.

172
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
It's an interesting name.

173
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Hello, Matsumoto-san and Wada-san.

174
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I don't have a boyfriend.

175
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I'm watching it with my family.

176
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Matsumoto-san and Wada-san said

177
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
that they appeared in Mr. Donut's commercial.

178
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I remember it, too.

179
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Please ask the staff to gather them.

180
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Actually,

181
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
How many years ago did we appear?

182
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
About five or six years ago.

183
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
About six years ago.

184
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
We appeared in Mr. Donut's commercial.

185
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I prepared it.

186
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Please give it to me.

187
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Don't pay attention to the talent.

188
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Can you see the front?

189
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Can you see the front?

190
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Can you see the front?

191
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Can you see the front?

192
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I told you.

193
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
You don't have to do this.

194
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
He's good.

195
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I told you.

196
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
You don't have to do this.

197
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
No one did this.

198
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
No one did this.

199
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
The other day,

200
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Osaka staff came to Tokyo.

201
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I interviewed them

202
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
in Harajuku and Shibuya.

203
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I interviewed them in Harajuku and Shibuya.

204
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
They talked badly about you.

205
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
They were scared.

206
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
They hit the rookies.

207
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
It was interpersonal use.

208
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Did you kill him?

209
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
They said that.

210
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
How could you ask them those questions?

211
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I didn't ask him that.

212
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I didn't ask him that.

213
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I didn't ask him that.

214
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I didn't say that.

215
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I didn't say that.

216
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
There are many representative

217
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
and威elys.

218
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
But my создation was really big surprise.

219
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Did you just kick me to death?

220
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
This is incredible.

221
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I can't move my hands at all.

222
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Not just my legs.

223
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
For some reason.

224
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Why can't I move my hands when it's so hard to kill?

225
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Why can't I only use my lower body?

226
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
So that's it.

227
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
He just brought the TV.

228
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
There are four patterns.

229
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Did you do all four?

230
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Yes.

231
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I think we all forgot about it.

232
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I want to see it too.

233
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Right?

234
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Let's go for now.

235
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
You're happy, right?

236
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I want to see it.

237
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
It's been six years.

238
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Let's go.

239
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Go ahead.

240
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
No matter how you look at it.

241
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
It's a rare item.

242
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
It's a customer who doesn't know what it is.

243
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I'm sorry I'm a party bot.

244
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,000
It's a rare item after all.

245
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
It's a customer who doesn't know what it is.

246
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
A box full of happiness.

247
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Do you want to do it or not?

248
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Do you want to do it or not?

249
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Say something.

250
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Say something.

251
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
You're not a man.

252
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I'll give you a gift.

253
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Donut. Donut.

254
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
What's going on?

255
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
You don't have to go.

256
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
It's a box.

257
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
What's going on?

258
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Paparinko glass present.

259
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Donut. Donut.

260
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
It's green. It's green.

261
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
It's 8 o'clock.

262
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
You'll never know.

263
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
This and this.

264
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
This and this.

265
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
This is Matsumoto.

266
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
This is me.

267
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I saw it in the morning.

268
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I can't see the time here.

269
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
It says 8 o'clock, 8 o'clock and a half.

270
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
That's all.

271
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
The first one is young.

272
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
It's young.

273
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I'm still a man with a deep hole.

274
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Really.

275
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Young. Young.

276
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I'm a little chubby compared to now.

277
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Is that so?

278
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I was like that at first.

279
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I've lost weight.

280
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
It was nostalgic.

281
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
It was nostalgic.

282
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
You collected it for me.

283
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Thank you very much.

284
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
If there's anything else,

285
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
If there's anything else,

286
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I'd like to introduce it on this show.

287
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
The monitor came out.

288
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Our director.

289
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I told you at the end.

290
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Do it with a pair of pants.

291
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I bought a pair of pants.

292
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I bought a pair of pants.

293
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
This is live, isn't it?

294
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
In the current situation.

295
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
In the current situation.

296
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Move it a little.

297
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Our Saito is wearing a pair of pants.

298
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
This is Saito.

299
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
This is the director.

300
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I told you at the end.

301
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Do it with a pair of pants.

302
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I told you at the end.

303
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I bought a pair of pants.

304
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I bought a pair of pants.

305
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I bought a pair of pants.

306
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Please take a look.

307
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
This is Saito.

308
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:45,000
This is Saito.

309
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
It's funny.

310
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
It's a serious face, isn't it?

311
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Who said that?

312
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
This is the best.

313
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
It's funny.

314
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Do you think everyone is doing it again?

315
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,000
If you wear a pair of pants, it will look like a brief.

316
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
It's like Kawamata-kun's brief.

317
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
It's amazing.

318
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Look.

319
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
This is also like a brief.

320
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I can't wear such a brief today.

321
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
It's like this.

322
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
It's a beautiful white.

323
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
It's a beautiful white.

324
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
It's dirty.

325
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
But you did it.

326
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
If you say it, I will do it.

327
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
If you say it, I will do it.

328
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
It's natural.

329
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Yes.

330
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Let's do this again.

331
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Let's think about it at the end.

332
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Yes.

333
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
It's okay.

334
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Thank you very much.

335
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
You did it well.

336
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Who is facing this way?

337
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Let's introduce the manuscript.

338
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Let's introduce the manuscript.

339
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Hurry up.

340
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
It's disgusting.

341
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
It's disgusting.

342
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Let's introduce it.

343
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
First, this person.

344
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
This person.

345
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Rather than asking a question, he asked if it was true.

346
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
He didn't write his pen name or name at all.

347
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
My friend's company's person is from Osaka.

348
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:14,000
When he was in high school, he said that he was a scary person.

349
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Is it true?

350
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
No one approached him, so Hamada-san always took care of him.

351
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
What kind of personality was bad?

352
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Was he scary?

353
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Hamada-san, can you tell me?

354
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Please.

355
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I will say it clearly.

356
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
When I was in high school, I had a crazy life.

357
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I had a lot of bad thoughts.

358
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
It's not true at all.

359
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I like fighting more than eating sandwiches.

360
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
It's not true.

361
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Did you join a gang?

362
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Yes, I did.

363
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,000
The person you were riding on was Chappie, right?

364
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
The guy who tuned up Chappie, right?

365
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Even if I tuned up Chappie, I was riding on Chappie.

366
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
You know my school uniform, right?

367
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
The one I wore in middle school.

368
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
There is a button here.

369
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
No.

370
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
No.

371
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
You have to use it properly.

372
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Let me tell you a story.

373
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I was really popular in middle school.

374
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I was popular.

375
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Life is about me.

376
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
When I graduated, the button was really gone.

377
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Tell me the truth.

378
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I really don't know.

379
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
All of my buttons are gone.

380
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I don't know.

381
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Which one of us was popular in middle school?

382
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Tell me the truth.

383
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I wasn't popular.

384
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
But you weren't popular either.

385
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I was really popular.

386
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
You were really cool back then.

387
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
But you had dark hair back then.

388
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
You had a lot of hair loss.

389
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Your face was round like this.

390
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
You are cool now.

391
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I admit it.

392
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I'm not that cool.

393
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I'm cool now.

394
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I don't do things like this.

395
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I was really popular.

396
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Really.

397
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I didn't do anything to women.

398
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I see.

399
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
If you don't say it, no one will believe you.

400
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Is that so?

401
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I don't want to talk about something I made up.

402
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
There are things that can be mistaken.

403
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I said it before.

404
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:44,000
A taxi driver was riding a car.

405
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
And he said,

406
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
What?

407
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Isn't he Mr. XXX?

408
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
There are things that can be mistaken.

409
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Today, I'm really cool.

410
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I've been waiting for you since the beginning.

411
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I was waiting for you at Tokyo Station.

412
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
The taxi was waiting for you.

413
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
When I got on the taxi,

414
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I said,

415
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Mr. B21.

416
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I don't even have to deny it.

417
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Does that mean you were waiting for Hiromi?

418
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
It's Hiromi.

419
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I can tell even if I wear sunglasses.

420
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I see.

421
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
If you say that,

422
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I won't be able to say it either.

423
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
So you went to the house to become Hiromi.

424
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Yes.

425
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I think it was a tea party.

426
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
He was wrong,

427
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
but I felt sorry for him if he got caught.

428
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
If I become Hiromi until the end,

429
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
it's for this man.

430
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
That's what I think.

431
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
So,

432
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I don't think I'll be able to use Osaka dialect.

433
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I see.

434
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Right?

435
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
So,

436
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I'm embarrassed to say,

437
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
please go to the right.

438
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
So,

439
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I'll just say,

440
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
right, left.

441
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Why?

442
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I don't know if it's right or left.

443
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Why did you say it in one word?

444
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Yoshusho.

445
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Why did you say it in one word?

446
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
After that,

447
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I'll say it in Osaka dialect.

448
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Where did you come from?

449
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
You said it in one word.

450
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I don't think I'll be able to use Osaka dialect.

451
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I think Hiromi is a quiet person.

452
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I see.

453
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
It's true.

454
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I don't think I'll be able to use Osaka dialect.

455
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I'm often told that I look like Hiromi.

456
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:26,000
There aren't many comedians who look like me.

457
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Like Kobuhei.

458
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
What?

459
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
This is the first time I've been told this.

460
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Don't say things that come to your mind.

461
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
This time,

462
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I hope I won't be mistaken for David.

463
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
It's not a lie.

464
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I think that's enough.

465
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
That's enough?

466
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
You talked a lot.

467
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I wonder how I'll use it.

468
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Right?

469
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I'm sorry.

470
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I always do it,

471
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
but this is the last time.

472
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Out of the 108, how many are there?

473
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
There are 108.

474
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
There are 34.

475
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
What?

476
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
There are 35.

477
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
35.

478
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Out of the 108, how many are there?

479
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I won't say their names.

480
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
You'll know right away.

481
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
They're similar.

482
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
You won't know if you've done it once.

483
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I'll never do the same thing again.

484
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
You'll know right away.

485
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Out of the 108, how many are there?

486
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Another one.

487
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Number 5.

488
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Number 5.

489
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Out of the 108, how many are there?

490
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
What?

491
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Out of the 108, how many are there?

492
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Out of the 108...

493
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
If you say number 5,

494
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
it means you've known it for a long time.

495
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
The numbers are fast.

496
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
I won't say their names.

497
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
You'll know right away.

498
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Number 5.

499
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
As you all know,

500
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I'm Tomomi Nishimura.

501
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
You're really Tomomi Nishimura?

502
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Really?

503
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
I didn't know anything,

504
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
but I thought you were doing something.

505
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
You're really Tomomi Nishimura?

506
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I thought you were doing something.

507
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I thought you were Tomomi Nishimura?

508
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I thought you were Tomomi Nishimura?

509
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I thought you were Tomomi Nishimura?

510
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
I thought you were Tomomi Nishimura?

511
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
No, I'm not Tomomi Nishimura.

512
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Really?

513
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Number 69.

514
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
It's a bit behind.

515
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I'm Kusuzairiko.

516
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Huh?

517
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Kusuzairiko.

518
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Kusuzairiko!

519
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
What number?

520
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
You guys are like...

521
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
You guys are like...

522
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
You guys are like an auction.

523
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
From the next one to the next one.

524
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
I only have one left.

525
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
You can think about that later.

526
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
The last one.

527
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Number 44.

528
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Master Ohira.

529
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Master Ohira is in the middle of something.

530
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
You must be talking about the treasure of Master Sakurai.

531
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Number 44.

532
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Master Ohira.

533
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Ah...

534
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
You don't have to do it.

535
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,000
That's all for today.

536
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Please come again if you have a chance.

537
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Thank you very much.

538
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
So, Master Ohira.

539
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Yes.

540
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,000
The cat you bought in the previous game.

541
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Was it lucky?

542
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Yes.

543
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
You said you'd give it to me, right?

544
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Yes.

545
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
About 600 pieces.

546
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Yes.

547
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
It's mine.

548
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Yes.

549
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I'll bring it to you.

550
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Yes.

551
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
You can choose one.

552
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Really?

553
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Yes.

554
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Yes.

555
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Yes.

556
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
This person.

557
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,000
This person is...

558
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Riki Naito.

559
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
He's a high school student from Kawasaki.

560
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Congratulations.

561
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Congratulations.

562
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
What do you have?

563
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Lucky.

564
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Lucky.

565
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Yes.

566
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
I'll give it to you.

567
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Yes.

568
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
The name is already decided as Lucky.

569
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Is that so?

570
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Please don't give me a strange name.

571
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Taito-chan, I don't think this is enough.

572
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
I have to take off this TK's shirt.

573
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
It's true.

574
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
It's true.

575
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
I see.

576
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
This is fashionable.

577
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Taito-chan, you did a good job today.

578
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
That's right.

579
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Yes.

580
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Look.

581
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
The other staff members are also amazing.

582
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Yes.

583
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,000
That serious face is not interesting.

584
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
It's cold, isn't it?

585
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Yes.

586
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
It's cold, isn't it?

587
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,000
When I heard your voice, I wondered why you did such a thing.

588
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I don't know.

589
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
What are you going to do next?

590
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
What?

591
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Next?

592
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Next?

593
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Yes.

594
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
What's next?

595
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Do you want someone to stab you?

596
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
That's right.

597
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
I have to stab someone.

598
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
This person is pitiful.

599
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
That's right.

600
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
I have to see Tsu-Chi's primitive man.

601
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
I see.

602
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Next week, Tsu-Chi is a primitive man.

603
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
He will be at the venue.

604
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:24,000
That's why Tsu-Chi primitive man's Tsu-Chi dinosaur.

605
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Let's do that.

606
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I will come again.

607
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
I will come again.

608
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
I am Duncan's kid's Tsu-Chi.

609
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Let's do our best next week.
