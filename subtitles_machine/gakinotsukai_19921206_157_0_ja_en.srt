1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Oh, it's a supermarket in Ikkaku-senshin.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Oh, it's a supermarket in Ikkaku.

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Thank you, thank you.

4
00:00:44,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Yeah, I'm also using the wheel because the oil temperature is low.

5
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Yes.

6
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
It was a fierce battle.

7
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Are you all right?

8
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I'm fine.

9
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
What I'm most afraid of is the signal.

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Whether it will work or not.

11
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Whether it's working or not.

12
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Are you doing what I told you to do?

13
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
No.

14
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
You shouldn't do that.

15
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
The water is cold.

16
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I think we have to deal with it.

17
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
It's pretty deep.

18
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
It's deep.

19
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Is that all you can do?

20
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I practiced a lot yesterday, too.

21
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
And...

22
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Can I ask you something?

23
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
When I was searching for sharks,

24
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I found this.

25
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I can't speak.

26
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Because I'm in the water.

27
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
When I found sharks,

28
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I found this.

29
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
When I found a chopper,

30
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I found this.

31
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
When I found this,

32
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I found this.

33
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I don't think I'll ever find it.

34
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
But...

35
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
They're violent, too.

36
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
If someone pulls my hair,

37
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I'll be fine.

38
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Okay?

39
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Okay?

40
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Okay?

41
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Okay?

42
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Yeah.

43
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I don't know what to do.

44
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Yeah.

45
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I don't have to fight sharks in a shock wave box.

46
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Right?

47
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Yeah.

48
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
But...

49
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
You don't have to do it.

50
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
You can't do it on Japanese TV.

51
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
You can't do it on NHK's documentary.

52
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I can't do it on NHK's documentary.

53
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Oh!

54
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Is it a shark?

55
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Is it?

56
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
No, it's not a shark.

57
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
You have to do it right away.

58
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Otherwise, I don't know.

59
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I'll watch it with this.

60
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Let's go!

61
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Okay.

62
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Let's go!

63
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Let's go!

64
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Okay.

65
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Let's go!

66
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Okay.

67
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Be careful.

68
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Why is the rope tied?

69
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Be careful!

70
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Okay!

71
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Let's go!

72
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I don't know what it is.

73
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
What is this?

74
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I haven't lost yet.

75
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Are you looking for it now?

76
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Yeah.

77
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I don't know what it is.

78
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I found it.

79
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I found it.

80
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I don't know.

81
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Oh!

82
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
It's a child.

83
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
No way!

84
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
It's fighting.

85
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Really?

86
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Is it fighting?

87
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
It's fighting.

88
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Is it fighting?

89
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Yeah!

90
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Yeah!

91
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Is this the same thing?

92
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Yeah.

93
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
It looks like it's fighting.

94
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
It's fighting.

95
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
It's fighting.

96
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
What happened?

97
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Are you okay?

98
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Oh!

99
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Oh, my God!

100
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Oh, my God!

101
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Oh, my God!

102
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
It's fighting.

103
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I want to stop it.

104
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
It's a sea bream.

105
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
It's a sea bream.

106
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:51,000
It's a sea bream.

107
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
There is no fish.

108
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Now is a good time.

109
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Now is a good time.

110
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
It's not recording.

111
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
It's not as good as we thought.

112
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Let's stop it.

113
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Let's stop it.

114
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Stop it.

115
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
It's not as good as we thought.

116
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Did you go to school today?

117
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Yes, I did.

118
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Do you go to school every day?

119
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Yes, every day.

120
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I see.

121
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
That's why you are the documentary of NHK.

122
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
That's true.

123
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Let's go to school!

124
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Let's go to school!

125
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I heard that you went to school.

126
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Well, well.

127
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Let's go to school.

128
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Let's go to school.

129
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Let's get excited.

130
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Let's go to school.

131
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I'm counting on you.

132
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Yes.

133
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Wait.

134
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Did you hear something?

135
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I heard it from here.

136
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Did you hear it?

137
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I heard it from here.

138
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
What?

139
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
What?

140
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
What?

141
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I heard it from here.

142
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
What?

143
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I heard it from here.

144
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I'm looking for it.

145
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
What?

146
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I didn't see it.

147
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I didn't see it.

148
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
It's a sweet shrimp.

149
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
It's 380 yen.

150
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
It's 280 yen for one matumoto.

151
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
What?

152
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
What?

153
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
What?

154
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
It's a mackerel.

155
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
It's a mackerel.

156
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
What?

157
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
It's one matumoto.

158
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
It's one matumoto.

159
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
It's one matumoto.

160
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
What?

161
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
It's a mackerel.

162
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
What?

163
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
What?

164
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
What?

165
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
What is it?

166
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Hey.

167
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
It's a mackerel.

168
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
What's going on?

169
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
What?

170
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
What is it?

171
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
We did it!

172
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
We are safe!

173
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
What is it?

174
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
We did it!

175
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I got it!

176
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I got it!

177
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Today's opening is 60 points.

178
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
What should we do?

179
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
What happened?

180
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Now, when it comes to the topic, it is that,

181
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
The Madonna photo book.

182
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Madonna?

183
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
What are you doing?

184
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Are you drawing Madonna?

185
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
How is it?

186
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Well,

187
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I don't know where it is.

188
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Certainly,

189
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
As I do in the news,

190
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I'm surrounded by thin men and Madonna.

191
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
After all,

192
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I'm sleeping.

193
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Why are you interested in such a place?

194
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
No!

195
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
No!

196
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
You are a fool!

197
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Madonna is a

198
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Madonna is a

199
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Madonna is a

200
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Madonna is a

201
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Madonna is a

202
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Madonna is a

203
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Madonna is a

204
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Madonna is a

205
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Madonna is a

206
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Madonna is a

207
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Madonna is a

208
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Madonna is a

209
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Madonna is a

210
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Madonna

211
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Madonna is a

212
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Madonna is a

213
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,400
What the hell is Madonna?

214
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:33,060
!

215
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:35,500
Can't we just get Madonna to be an a-hole?

216
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,960
It doesn't make any sense if Madonna is an a-hole.

217
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:39,840
What's Madonna.

218
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:41,940
What makes you understand?

219
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,220
Oh, Madonna's to be.

220
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:46,740
What's Madonna?

221
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,860
It doesn't make any sense if Madonna is頑派.

222
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:50,600
A-hole?

223
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,740
That's no, no.

224
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,300
You can't hide it.

225
00:09:56,300 --> 00:10:01,300
In my opinion, women have become clear recently, so I don't know if that's the case.

226
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:05,300
It depends on the country.

227
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:08,300
There are things that even a father can't do.

228
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:11,300
It's no good to be united.

229
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:14,300
It's okay if you don't unite.

230
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:23,300
That's why I can't get a robot.

231
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:28,300
Why don't you say something?

232
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:31,300
I don't know why.

233
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:35,300
Japan is gradually becoming clear, isn't it?

234
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:40,300
In Japan, an amateur wants to leave my beautiful nakedness.

235
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:43,300
There's no such thing as a beautiful thing.

236
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:45,300
I don't like it.

237
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:48,300
There's no such thing as a beautiful body.

238
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:51,300
Something is definitely wrong.

239
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:58,300
I'm slow because I have a good proportion, but when I'm like this, I'm like an Ultraman.

240
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:01,300
My bones are like this.

241
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:04,300
I'm like, I'll give you a check.

242
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:09,300
It's really a great world, isn't it?

243
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:11,300
What kind of people are you talking about?

244
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:13,300
That's what I'm talking about.

245
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:15,300
I'm not saying anything else.

246
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:20,300
That's why I can't fall for it.

247
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:25,300
You fell for it when you saw Miyazawa Rie in the Asahi newspaper.

248
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:29,300
You're the only one who falls for it in the newspaper.

249
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,300
Are you stupid?

250
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:32,300
I was surprised.

251
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:33,300
Why?

252
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,300
Why?

253
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:39,300
It's the first time I've been able to get naked.

254
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:42,300
My wife pulled it out.

255
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:45,300
I was turning it over.

256
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:49,300
I have a wife.

257
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:52,300
I thought I was going to die.

258
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:56,300
I hid it.

259
00:11:56,300 --> 00:12:00,300
I thought, go to bed, go to bed.

260
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:05,300
I checked the story and said, Hira-kun, you shouldn't make a sound.

261
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:08,300
I said something like that.

262
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:11,300
Maybe you're watching it before me.

263
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,300
Then the sound of the newspaper will be equal.

264
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:18,300
You'll think I'm watching it.

265
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:21,300
Clip.

266
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:24,300
What about the draft?

267
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:27,300
What are you talking about?

268
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:29,300
What's going to happen to the draft?

269
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:30,300
Who's the star of the year?

270
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:32,300
It's a guy from Seiryo.

271
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,300
Who?

272
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:36,300
Matsushita from Seiryo.

273
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:39,300
It's Matsui.

274
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:43,300
Do you want that?

275
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:47,300
How much is he?

276
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:49,300
How much is he?

277
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:50,300
How much is 100 million?

278
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:51,300
How much is 100 million?

279
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,300
Do you want that?

280
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,300
It's amazing.

281
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,300
What's amazing?

282
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:57,300
The patching.

283
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:59,300
Is that so?

284
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:03,300
I'm not the first person to buy that kind of thing for 100 million.

285
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:06,300
That's why the titans are like this.

286
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,300
Only the titans can buy that?

287
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:09,300
Is it a draft for that?

288
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:11,300
Which team will win the auction?

289
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:13,300
For example, even if I want to buy it, I can't.

290
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:15,300
What are you going to do?

291
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:18,300
What are you going to do with Matsui?

292
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:21,300
Are you going to take him to the scene?

293
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,300
Like Deshiko?

294
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:24,300
Is that impossible?

295
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:25,300
Of course it's impossible.

296
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:27,300
But that's Amada.

297
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:30,300
What? What's Amada?

298
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:31,300
Is that impossible?

299
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:33,300
It's impossible.

300
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:35,300
Do you have anything to use?

301
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:37,300
I think I should take it.

302
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:39,300
Who?

303
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,300
Me.

304
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:41,300
There?

305
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:45,300
Anywhere.

306
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:48,300
Is the test over?

307
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,300
What test?

308
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:52,300
The professional test.

309
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:53,300
It's over.

310
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:55,300
Then I don't know.

311
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:58,300
Do you want to go?

312
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:59,300
The entrance test?

313
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:00,300
Yes.

314
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,300
I'm serious.

315
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:03,300
I'm going in.

316
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,300
I can't help it at that time.

317
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:07,300
I'm going to disband gradually.

318
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:09,300
I'm going in.

319
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:12,300
Where do you want to go?

320
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,300
Where should I go?

321
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:16,300
What are you?

322
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:18,300
What are you?

323
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:21,300
What am I?

324
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:22,300
No.

325
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:24,300
What's the baseball data?

326
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,300
What's the pitcher?

327
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:27,300
What's the yas?

328
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,300
It's short.

329
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,300
It's a non-yash.

330
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:31,300
It's a non-yash.

331
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:32,300
Really?

332
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:33,300
Yes.

333
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:35,300
Where do you want to go?

334
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:38,300
Daiei?

335
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:39,300
Why do you want to go to Daiei?

336
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:41,300
Daiei feels good.

337
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:43,300
What are you talking about?

338
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:46,300
It's cheap.

339
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:48,300
Are you stupid?

340
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:50,300
Anyone can go to the professional test, right?

341
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:52,300
Yes, anyone can go.

342
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:53,300
What is it?

343
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:56,300
The course, the course.

344
00:14:56,300 --> 00:15:00,300
The course and the course alone are really amazing.

345
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:01,300
It's a course.

346
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:04,300
It's a course.

347
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:08,300
It's a course.

348
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:09,300
It's far away.

349
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:10,300
It's far away.

350
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:11,300
Throw it around like this.

351
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:14,300
Throw it around like this.

352
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:16,300
It's far away.

353
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:18,300
It's not far away.

354
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,300
It's really far away.

355
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:21,300
I'll throw it.

356
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:23,300
You're young.

357
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:26,300
I'll try to throw it to the other side.

358
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:33,300
It's a circle.

359
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:34,300
Where are you looking?

360
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:35,300
I'm sure you've been there a lot.

361
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:36,300
I haven't been there.

362
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:37,300
I haven't been there.

363
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:38,300
I've been there a lot.

364
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,300
I haven't been there.

365
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,300
It's a place like this.

366
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:42,300
I can't get out of here.

367
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:45,300
I'm so frustrated.

368
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:48,300
Do you know the difference between Serif and Parim?

369
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,300
I know.

370
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,300
What are you talking about?

371
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:51,300
What is Serif?

372
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:54,300
What are you talking about?

373
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:56,300
Are you stupid?

374
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:57,300
I'm sorry.

375
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:59,300
I'm sorry, but I'll tell you.

376
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:00,300
It's a giant.

377
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:01,300
It's a giant.

378
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:04,300
What?

379
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:08,300
Is it a midday?

380
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,300
Weil's not moving fast.

381
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,300
It's in Hiroshima.

382
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:11,300
Hurry up.

383
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:12,300
Then it's the sun.

384
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:13,300
Sun?

385
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:20,300
One more, look.

386
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:21,300
It doesn't matter if I tell you about the sun first.

387
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:23,300
What's the matter?

388
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:25,300
There's a problem on the sun.

389
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:26,300
It doesn't matter.

390
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:27,300
I'll do one last word.

391
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:36,300
This is like a spell, so if you don't continue, if I ask you to say the sun, Hamada-kun, I'll be there.

392
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:40,300
What are you talking about?

393
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:43,300
I told you to hurry up and go!

394
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:45,300
I just said it!

395
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,300
You didn't say it, you missed one.

396
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:48,300
You're a titan, aren't you?

397
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:49,300
Yes, yes, yes.

398
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,300
The sun!

399
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,300
Yes, one more.

400
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:55,300
So don't say the sun!

401
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:57,300
You're talking about a sun too early now.

402
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:58,300
You're a titan, aren't you.

403
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:59,300
Yes.

404
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,300
You're a sun, aren't you.

405
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:01,300
No.

406
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,300
You're a midday, aren't you.

407
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,300
Yes.

408
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,300
You're a Hanshin.

409
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:05,300
Yes.

410
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,300
And then you're Hiroshima, aren't you?

411
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:07,300
One more.

412
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:10,300
So don't say the sun!

413
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:11,300
Stop it.

414
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:13,300
If you say the sun, you won't be told anything.

415
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,300
Isn't it the sun you want to know?

416
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,300
If you say such a thing.

417
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:17,300
What are you talking about?

418
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:18,300
I can't say it.

419
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:20,300
It hurts if you say the sun.

420
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:24,300
Who are you to say such a thing?

421
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:31,300
I can't say it's a parry, can I?

422
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:35,300
I can't say it's a parry, can I?

423
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:38,300
It's a save, right?

424
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:41,300
I can say it's a parry, right?

425
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:43,300
I can't say it's a save, right?

426
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:45,300
I can't say it's a parry, can I?

427
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:47,300
Why are you so mad?

428
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,300
You're so stupid!

429
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,300
What's a save and what?

430
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:52,300
What?

431
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:54,300
You're saying it, right?

432
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:55,300
I'm saying only two things.

433
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:56,300
You're getting more and more mad!

434
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:57,300
I'm not mad!

435
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,300
I'm just saying two things!

436
00:17:58,300 --> 00:17:59,300
You're getting more and more mad!

437
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:02,300
If you say it so fast, you'll be thrown off the field!

438
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:04,300
You won't be able to keep up with me!

439
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:05,300
You!

440
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:06,300
You're thinking that.

441
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:07,300
You're!

442
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:09,300
Gosh!

443
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:14,300
If you can't say that you're a full-backs' sixth team or 12th team, then you're not good at baseball?

444
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:15,300
I can't say that.

445
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:16,300
I can't say that.

446
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:21,300
I may not be able to say that, but I'm insanely good!

447
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:24,300
I want you to try to swing it.

448
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,300
What do you mean?

449
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:28,300
Like batting.

450
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:34,300
That was really...

451
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:36,300
That was really flying.

452
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,300
It's really okay.

453
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,300
It's really okay.

454
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:53,300
It's really okay. If you can't do it in secret, you can do it in the opening like a protest.

455
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,300
There's a standard.

456
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,300
Let's do a speed gun.

457
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,300
That's a good idea.

458
00:18:58,300 --> 00:18:59,300
Let's do that.

459
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:02,300
How many kilograms of speed gun can you do?

460
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:08,300
The highest is about 121.

461
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:09,300
I don't think so.

462
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:13,300
You're a young bird.

463
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:16,300
How many kilograms can you do?

464
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:19,300
I've never measured it.

465
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:23,300
How many kilograms of speed gun can you do?

466
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,300
What?

467
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:28,300
What?

468
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:30,300
How many kilograms of speed gun can you do?

469
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:33,300
How many kilograms of speed gun can you do?

470
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:35,300
How many kilograms of speed gun can you do?

471
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:38,300
Like a spinning top.

472
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:41,300
I'm sorry. I'm like that.

473
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:47,300
Matsumoto-san always says bad things about me.

474
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:50,300
How much do you think you're cool?

475
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:55,300
But it's not funny to say this.

476
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:59,300
How many points out of 100 do you think you're cool?

477
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:04,300
How many points do you think you're cool?

478
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:09,300
How many points do you think you're cool?

479
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:12,300
I've never eaten enough.

480
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:21,300
My eyebrows are a little more beautiful.

481
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:23,300
There's a part that's a little rough.

482
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:28,300
There's a part that's a little rough.

483
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:34,300
I'll take this off and do about 60 points.

484
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:39,300
I'll take this off and do about 60 points.

485
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:42,300
How many points do you think you're cool?

486
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:45,300
How many points do you think you're cool?

487
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:50,300
There's a lot of parts in the middle.

488
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:55,300
There's a lot of parts in the middle.

489
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:58,300
It's like a Thai.

490
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:01,300
It's like a Thai.

491
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:04,300
Don't be so polite.

492
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:07,300
There's a lot of parts in the middle.

493
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:10,300
There's a lot of parts in the middle.

494
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:13,300
That's right.

495
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:16,300
About 80 points.

496
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:22,300
80 points?

497
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:24,300
How many points do you think you're cool?

498
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:26,300
20 points.

499
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:33,300
Even if there are four Joes, you're not cool.

500
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:36,300
You're amazing.

501
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:39,300
How many points do you think you're cool?

502
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,300
How many points do you think you're cool?

503
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:45,300
I'm really sorry.

504
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,300
I'm really sorry.

505
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:49,300
I'm 100 points.

506
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:51,300
I'm really sorry.

507
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:55,300
I'm really sorry.

508
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:58,300
As a man, I don't know how to say this.

509
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:01,300
As a man, I don't know how to say this.

510
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:04,300
I'm not cool.

511
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:07,300
I'm not cool.

512
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:22,300
I'm not cool.
