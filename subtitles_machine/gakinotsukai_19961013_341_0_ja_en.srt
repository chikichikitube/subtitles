00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
In the first episode of Gaki no Tsukai, we will investigate the popularity of talent in all of Japan in 1996!

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Let's introduce the talents who will be participating.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
First, next to them is Pierre Kaki!

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Next to him is Ana Iroko!

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Next to him is Matsumoto Kancho!

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Hello, nice to meet you.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:34,000
From now on, we will drop the talents' belongings on the street.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
We will give you the time until they are picked up.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:48,000
The last person with the highest points will receive 100,000 yen as a prize.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I can go home and sell it.

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
The person with the highest points will receive 100,000 yen as a prize.

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
The first talent is...

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
This!

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Date Kimiko's tennis racket.

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Everyone, please look at this.

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Kimiko Date?

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
It's written here.

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
There's no way it's written here.

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I don't get it.

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
The average person would think it's Kimiko Date.

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
First is Date Kimiko's tennis racket.

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Pierre has 25 seconds, Ana has 60 seconds, and Matsumoto has 4 minutes and 15 seconds.

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Let's go!

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
25 seconds, 60 seconds, 4 minutes and 15 seconds.

25
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Ready, start!

26
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
What?

27
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Wait a minute.

28
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
It's already 8.9 seconds.

29
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
It's already 11 seconds.

30
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
These two will pick it up.

31
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
What is that?

32
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
There's a racket.

33
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
What?

34
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
The foreigner picked it up.

35
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Two minutes?

36
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
The foreigner picked it up.

37
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Well, I picked it up anyway.

38
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
It's just a matter of manners.

39
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
It can't be helped.

40
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
It's 4 minutes, but...

41
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
It's 3 minutes.

42
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Here's the next question.

43
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
The next question is...

44
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Kimutaku's script for the long-haired ghost.

45
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Is this for real?

46
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Kimutaku's script for the long-haired ghost.

47
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Kimutaku?

48
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Kimutaku?

49
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
That's...

50
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I'll get in trouble.

51
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Kimutaku's script for the long-haired ghost.

52
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
1 minute for the long-haired ghost, 46 seconds for the short-haired ghost, and 18 seconds for the long-haired ghost.

53
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Ready, start!

54
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I'll get in trouble.

55
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Should I drop it?

56
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
This is fast.

57
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
9, 10, 11, 18 seconds.

58
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
14 seconds.

59
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I can pick it up standing up, right?

60
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I didn't expect it to be a human.

61
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I dropped it.

62
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
It's in front of you.

63
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
It's laughing.

64
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
It's laughing.

65
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
It's laughing.

66
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
It's laughing.

67
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
1 minute has passed.

68
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Really?

69
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Time out!

70
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Unexpectedly, it's not popular.

71
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
That's true.

72
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
It's not popular.

73
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
The next question is...

74
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
The legendary record of the boy band Degameron.

75
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
What?

76
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
What?

77
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I thought so.

78
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I'm curious if I can listen to it because I opened it.

79
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
It's a record.

80
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I see.

81
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
If you think about the possibility of winning.

82
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
The next question is...

83
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
The legendary record of the boy band Degameron.

84
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
1 minute and 50 seconds.

85
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
3 minutes and 15 seconds.

86
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
The legendary record of the boy band Degameron.

87
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Ready, go!

88
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Start!

89
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I'll get in trouble.

90
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
It's like I'm fixing my shoes.

91
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I see.

92
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Where is it?

93
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Where is it?

94
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
It hurts.

95
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
What is it?

96
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I was sad.

97
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
It's fast.

98
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I got it.

99
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I got it.

100
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I got it.

101
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I got it.

102
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
It's over.

103
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
It was fast.

104
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
29 seconds.

105
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
2 points.

106
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I thought it would be easy.

107
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Really?

108
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Next is this.

109
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
The glasses of Shohei Shofutei.

110
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
What is this?

111
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
How?

112
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
This is like this.

113
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Please use it freely.

114
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Shohei.

115
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
He said it.

116
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
He said it.

117
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
That's strong.

118
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
These glasses.

119
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Please think about it.

120
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Please think about it.

121
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I don't know.

122
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
It's like a TV.

123
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Next is the glasses of Shohei Shofutei.

124
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
22 seconds.

125
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
2 minutes.

126
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
If you get it right.

127
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
2 points.

128
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Don't step on it.

129
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Don't pick it up.

130
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I kicked it.

131
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
You kicked it.

132
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
You kicked it.

133
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
You kicked it.

134
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
It's bad.

135
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
It's broken.

136
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
It's broken.

137
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
It's broken.

138
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
It doesn't look like Shohei.

139
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
It's sad.

140
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
It's no good.

141
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
2 minutes.

142
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
5 seconds.

143
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
7 seconds.

144
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I picked it up in 1 minute and 7 seconds.

145
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I picked it up in 1 minute and 7 seconds.

146
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
It's Shohei's glasses.

147
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Put it on.

148
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
It's Shohei's glasses.

149
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
It's broken.

150
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
You can put it on.

151
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
You can put it on.

152
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
You can put it on.

153
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
You can put it on.

154
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
You can put it on.

155
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
You did it.

156
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
You're the best.

157
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
The last question is here.

158
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Curry rice cracker.

159
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Curry rice cracker.

160
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
It's no good.

161
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
It's spicy.

162
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
It's not bad.

163
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
It's food.

164
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
It's good.

165
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
It's good.

166
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Is it good?

167
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
It's not good.

168
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I told Pierre.

169
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I want to see the sticker.

170
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Is there anyone who wants a sticker?

171
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Yes.

172
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
This is a propaganda.

173
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
This is a propaganda.

174
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I'm a little lucky.

175
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I got a good one.

176
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Next is the curry rice cracker in downtown.

177
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Pierre 1 minute and 55 seconds.

178
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Anai 2 minutes and 30 seconds.

179
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Matcha 4 minutes.

180
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I got a sticker.

181
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I got a sticker.

182
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I got a sticker.

183
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Look, look, look.

184
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
He's not even looking at me.

185
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I kicked it.

186
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I kicked it, so I saw it.

187
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I kicked it myself.

188
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I'll kick it again.

189
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I'll kick it again.

190
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I didn't notice it.

191
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:50,000
You guys have a sticker.

192
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
What are you going to do if there's a stupid man in there?

193
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
What are you going to do?

194
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I want to think.

195
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
5 seconds left.

196
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Yeah, yeah.

197
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
It's over.

198
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
It's over.

199
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Time over.

200
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
And here's another reverse quiz.

201
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Now, everyone.

202
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Pierre, who was the lowest in the game,

203
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I got you in a cardboard box.

204
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I'll put a sticker like this.

205
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Pierre is tired and sleeping.

206
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Don't open it.

207
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I'm having fun.

208
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I'm having fun.

209
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I'm scared.

210
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
How many minutes and seconds do you have to go?

211
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
How many seconds do you have to go?

212
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I'll open the box.

213
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
What do you think about this?

214
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
If you like Pierre so much,

215
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I won't open it.

216
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
If you like Pierre so much,

217
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Pierre is tired.

218
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
A cardboard box where Pierre sleeps.

219
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Pierre is 4 minutes and 20 seconds.

220
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Anai is 4 minutes and 38 seconds.

221
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Matcha is 2 minutes and 50 seconds.

222
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Pierre, who can get out of the cardboard box right away.

223
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Will the time come when the lid can be opened?

224
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
The time has come.

225
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Taki is being carried.

226
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Pierre is being carried now.

227
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I'll put it in the middle.

228
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Ready, start.

229
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Don't stand out.

230
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Don't stand out.

231
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Don't stand out.

232
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I opened it.

233
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
The lid is blocked.

234
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
The lid is blocked.

235
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I'm scared.

236
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I'm scared.

237
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I'm scared.

238
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Taki is over.

239
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I'm over.

240
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I'm over.

241
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I'm very interested.

242
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I'm very interested.

243
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Please.

244
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I opened it.

245
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I opened it.

246
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I opened it.

247
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I opened it in 36 seconds.

248
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I opened it.

249
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I opened it.

250
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I opened it.

251
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I won.

252
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Welcome home.

253
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Pierre opened it in 4 minutes and 38 seconds.

254
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Are you scared?

255
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I'm scared.

256
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I'm serious.

257
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Pierre opened it in 4 minutes and 36 seconds.

258
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I'll ask Matsumoto to open it.

259
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Pierre opened it in 4 minutes and 36 seconds.

260
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I'll ask Matsumoto to open it in 10 seconds.

261
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I'll ask Matsumoto to open it in 10 seconds.

262
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
The cardboard box is thin.

263
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
The cardboard box is thin.

264
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I'm scared.

265
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I'm scared.

266
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I'm scared.

267
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I'm scared.

268
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I'm very scared.

269
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I'm scared.

270
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I'm very scared.

271
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Please set it up.

272
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:24,000
The paper is separated.

273
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I didn't know it was like this.

274
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I didn't know it was like this.

275
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I didn't know it was like this.

276
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I didn't know it was like this.

277
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Ready, start.

278
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
What is this?

279
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
It's creepy.

280
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
There was a big cardboard box.

281
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
that's my favorite one.

282
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
that's my favorite one.

283
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
That's my favorite one.

284
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
It's not pretty.

285
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Is it a young man?

286
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Take a look.

287
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I wonder if it's true.

288
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
It's like a kid.

289
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
He's a junior high school student.

290
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
He's laughing.

291
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I said, that's not true.

292
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
What should I do?

293
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I'm scared now.

294
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I stopped next to it.

295
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I went.

296
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
No way.

297
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I opened it.

298
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I opened it.

299
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
4 minutes.

300
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I wonder if it's true.

301
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I'm so scared.

302
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
What was that?

303
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
He's scared.

304
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I was so scared.

305
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
He's scared.

306
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
It's funny.

307
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I'm scared.

308
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Please sit down.

309
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I'll give this to the viewers.

310
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
If you want it,

311
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I'll give it to you.

312
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Please write a letter.

313
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Do you use the steering wheel I made?

314
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I think so.

315
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Do you use the steering wheel I made?

316
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I think so.

317
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Don't lie.

318
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Don't lie.

319
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Don't lie.

320
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Don't lie.

321
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Don't lie.

322
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Don't lie.

323
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Don't lie.

324
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Don't lie.

325
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Don't lie.

326
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Don't lie.
