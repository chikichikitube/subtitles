00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Pigs, also known as the Gu-Temoku boar, are a species of wild boar.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Their origin dates back to the Paleolithic period, when European, Chinese, and Indian boars evolved into wild boars.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
In Central and Western Europe, pigs were an important food source for the common people.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
However, the influence of their religious beliefs made them a popular term for evil spirits.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Also, in Japan, in the early days of Japan, pigs were bred and their history is old.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
In the course of time, the influence of Buddhism brought them down, but they were also popularized along with civilization.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
There are more than 300 species of pigs.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Approximately 800 million of them are sold worldwide.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Their weight ranges from 80kg to 200kg.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
They give birth to 6 to 16 pigs at a time.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Pigs are often misunderstood as having a lot of fat,

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
but they are actually the most nutritious and balanced protein food for the Japanese.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:57,000
This is proven by the fact that Okinawan people eat about 1.7 times the amount of pork per day and are ranked as the best in the country.

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
And today, we are going to eat these wonderful pigs.

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Today, we are going to give you more and more presents.

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Thank you.

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
It's all about presents.

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
These guys are really...

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Today, they are all wearing summer clothes.

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
This year's summer was hot.

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
That's right.

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
We are here to solve the summer heat.

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Over here.

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Over here.

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Thank you.

26
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
This is the best-known pork in Maruyaki.

27
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
It's called Yorkshire.

28
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
It's a good one.

29
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
It's a good-looking pig.

30
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
That's right.

31
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
It's Maruyaki.

32
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
It's wonderful.

33
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
You've never seen it, have you?

34
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I've never seen it.

35
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
It's a good dish, isn't it?

36
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
A good dish?

37
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Yes.

38
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
It's a high-class dish, isn't it?

39
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Yes.

40
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Why is it so small?

41
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
This program is brought to you by the following sponsors.

42
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Wow.

43
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
What is this?

44
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Salt and pepper, right?

45
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
We have to do this by hand, right?

46
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
What?

47
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
It's hot.

48
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Everyone is angry.

49
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
It's hot.

50
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
It's hot.

51
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
The smell is from here.

52
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Yamazaki.

53
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
The smell is from here.

54
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
It's hot.

55
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
He gets angry very quickly.

56
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
What?

57
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
He gets angry very quickly.

58
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Is it inside?

59
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Yes.

60
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
It's inside.

61
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
What?

62
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
It's inside.

63
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
It's inside.

64
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
If you don't taste it, it's bad.

65
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
You should rub it.

66
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Yes.

67
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
He's fast.

68
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
He's fast.

69
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
He's fast.

70
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
He gets angry very quickly.

71
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
It's hot.

72
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
You have to rub the salt because there's only the salt.

73
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
The salt won't come clean.

74
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,100
And you have to rub.

75
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,640
I can't drink in this attire.

76
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,000
Some softness than usual.

77
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Now you're really enjoying it.

78
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Good, good.

79
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Here it goes

80
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:26,860
sudah

81
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Today as well.

82
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
You're not kidding, are you?

83
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
It's enough.

84
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
You've gone mad.

85
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Have you?

86
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
It's good, isn't it?

87
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Look at this fat

88
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
It's good

89
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
It reminds me of Hamabe

90
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Is there anything else I should put on?

91
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
The butt

92
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Wow

93
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
That's a big one

94
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
The butt

95
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Oh, this nice part

96
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
What is this?

97
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
You have to turn it slowly

98
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Slowly

99
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:28,600
It's a nice

100
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,000
color

101
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,000
The butt shrank

102
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Turn it

103
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
It's amazing

104
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
It looks good, doesn't it?

105
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
It looks like Shimura Ken

106
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
The tail got longer

107
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Why?

108
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Because of the fire

109
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
The tail broke

110
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Isn't it soft?

111
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
The fat

112
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
It looks good

113
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
The juice

114
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
It looks good

115
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
It looks really good

116
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
The way you cut it

117
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I don't know

118
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,000
You look like you're happy

119
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Here you go

120
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Is this salt and pepper?

121
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Can I cut it?

122
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Here you go

123
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I'm not a regular, so eat it

124
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I'm not a regular

125
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
It's good

126
00:05:47,000 --> 00:06:01,000
It's really good

127
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Is everyone having a good time?

128
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Yes

129
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Don't die in the summer

130
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
It's the end of the summer

131
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Thank you for your hard work

132
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Thank you

133
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Thank you

134
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
It's good

135
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Thank you

136
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Did everyone have a good meal?

137
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Yes

138
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Thank you

139
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Thank you

140
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
We ate well

141
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Please do your best for the second half of the year

142
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I'll do my best

143
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Ladies and gentlemen

144
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
When did you come back to the ladies and gentlemen?

145
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
About 3 or 4 weeks ago

146
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Today is good

147
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:32,000
This is cool

148
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Today is good

149
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
This is cool

150
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
This is cool

151
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
This is popular

152
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
It's not popular

153
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
It's not popular

154
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
It's like the prince of the lake

155
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I don't laugh

156
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
We are the only ones who laugh

157
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
It's really quiet

158
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I don't know if it's S

159
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,000
It's better when it's hot

160
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,000
It's good

161
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I was surprised

162
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Yoshimoto Kogyo is dirty

163
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
It's really dirty

164
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Really?

165
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Yoshimoto doesn't put in a lot of gyala

166
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
It used to be a month late

167
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
If you work this month, it will be in the next month

168
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
That's right

169
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
About half a year ago, it was two months late

170
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Matsumoto thinks it's strange

171
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I was surprised when I heard it

172
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Why?

173
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
There was a reason for this one month

174
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
It would have been better if it was in the next month

175
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:57,000
But he put it in the bank and increased the interest

176
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I was surprised

177
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Really?

178
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
What is this company?

179
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Normally it's like that

180
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Really?

181
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I was surprised

182
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
The president of Yoshimoto said in a magazine

183
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Matsumoto put in 600 million this year

184
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I don't have 600 million

185
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
It's a lie

186
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
It's a lie

187
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I don't have 600 million

188
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
He said he put in 600 million

189
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
But I earned it

190
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I earned it

191
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I ran

192
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Matsumoto said it's a lie

193
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
It's a lie

194
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I said it's a lie

195
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Why are you angry?

196
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
It's a dirty company

197
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
But I can't help it

198
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I always think

199
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
For example, I live in Tokyo

200
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I have an apartment

201
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
But I can't help thinking

202
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
For example, from the program

203
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I have to pay for accommodation and taxi

204
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
You don't live here?

205
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
But I have to pay

206
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I take all the money

207
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
It's a bad luck

208
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
It's a bad luck

209
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I thought you would say that

210
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I'm not talking about this

211
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
You're not

212
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
You've been talking about that

213
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Wait

214
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I don't care about this

215
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I'm talking about this

216
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I know it's easy to take

217
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I'm not talking about money

218
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I'm talking about my feelings

219
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
A while ago

220
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I went back to Osaka

221
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I heard you were snoring

222
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Why?

223
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I don't want to talk about this

224
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I heard you were snoring

225
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Are you stupid?

226
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
No

227
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
When I talk about this

228
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I get angry

229
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
You want to talk, right?

230
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Go ahead

231
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I live in Tokyo

232
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I don't know what you're talking about

233
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
What are you doing?

234
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
What are you talking about?

235
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I live in Tokyo

236
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
To be honest

237
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I don't know what you're talking about

238
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
To be honest

239
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I'm a snorer

240
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I'm sorry

241
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I'm angry

242
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I'm not talking about this

243
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Really

244
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Why did you snore?

245
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I don't know

246
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I'm a snorer

247
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I was walking normally

248
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
It's normal

249
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
It's been a week

250
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
It's been a long time

251
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
You look cute

252
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
To be honest

253
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I have a lot of gold

254
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Don't brag

255
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Let me talk

256
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I have 4 gold

257
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I have 5 gold

258
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
To be honest

259
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I don't have many talents

260
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
It's okay

261
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
You don't have many talents

262
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
You have 31 talents

263
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
It's okay

264
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Tell me why you were walking

265
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Right now

266
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I'm a snorer

267
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I'm a snorer

268
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I don't like it

269
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I looked back

270
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
on Osaka

271
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I want to be a snorer

272
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Why were you walking?

273
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Tell me

274
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I want to be a snorer

275
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
like I was back then

276
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
It's dangerous

277
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I understand

278
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
You're a snorer

279
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
You know people come to you

280
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I wanted to be a snorer

281
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I was a snorer

282
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I sometimes

283
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Where?

284
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I was walking

285
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Like this

286
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Why are you wearing a basket?

287
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I'm not wearing a basket

288
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Why did we talk about this?

289
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I went back to Osaka

290
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I went back to Osaka

291
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I went back to Osaka

292
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Of course

293
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I went back to Osaka

294
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I asked my parents

295
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
to get me a Shinkansen

296
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I stayed at a hotel

297
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I asked my parents

298
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
to pay me

299
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
You went there in private

300
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Pay me

301
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Why?

302
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
You went there for fun

303
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Pay me

304
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Why are you standing there?

305
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Pay me

306
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
What do you mean?

307
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
You're living in Tokyo for work

308
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
You're not going to Osaka

309
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
You're going home

310
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
You don't live here

311
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
But

312
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I can pay you

313
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
No

314
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
You have to pay

315
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I'm not paying

316
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I'm talking about this

317
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
You're not paying

318
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Pay me

319
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Pay me

320
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
It's not 10,000 yen

321
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
You're saying mean things

322
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Is it mean?

323
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Am I dirty?

324
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
It's cold

325
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
What are you doing?

326
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Why are you so angry?

327
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Don't say that

328
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I said it because I knew

329
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
What is that?

330
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Come with me

331
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Let's do something

332
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Let's do a concert

333
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I want you to pay me

334
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I'll get paid

335
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I'll pay you

336
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
That's against the company

337
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I'll pay you

338
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
You can't do that

339
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I want to do it

340
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I want to do it

341
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
It's cold

342
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
It's cold

343
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
You're saying it's cold

344
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
It hurts

345
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Where are you going?

346
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I noticed that

347
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
You use animal characters

348
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Black cat, pelican, kangaroo, duck

349
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Is there anything in common?

350
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I don't know

351
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I don't know what you mean

352
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Is there anything in common?

353
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Let me ask

354
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I'm saying

355
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Black cat, pelican, kangaroo, duck

356
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
What is it?

357
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
It's an animal

358
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
You use animal characters

359
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
You use animal characters

360
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
You know animals

361
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
First

362
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
It's full of hair

363
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Full of hair?

364
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
It's not just black cat

365
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Kangaroo is full of hair

366
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
It's not full of hair

367
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
It's not smooth

368
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
It's not smooth

369
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Why are you saying that?

370
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
It's my job

371
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
It's my job

372
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
It's full of hair

373
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
It's not just black cat

374
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
It's not just black cat

375
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
It's not just black cat

376
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Why do you close your eyes when you cry?

377
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Why do you close your eyes when you cry?

378
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
It's a face

379
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
It's a face

380
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
This is a good thing

381
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
This is a good thing

382
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
No

383
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Everyone has an item

384
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Everyone has an item

385
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
There is a kangaroo

386
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
There is a kangaroo

387
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
There is a pelican

388
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
There is a pelican

389
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
There is a black cat

390
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
It's not an item

391
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
It's forcibly

392
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
It's forcibly

393
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
It's forcibly

394
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
You can put it inside

395
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
You can put it inside

396
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
That depends on which side can put it

397
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
No

398
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
No

399
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
No

400
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
This black cat is my parent

401
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
No

402
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
This black cat is my parent

403
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
So what? It doesn't hurt that much.

404
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
No, no, no.

405
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
The ones who can put it in are all individuals.

406
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
But the pain is separate.

407
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Stupid!

408
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Stupid?

409
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Your mother can put a stand in it, but she's holding it in.

410
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Your mother can put a stand in her butt, but she's holding it in.

411
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
So I can't wear a yohane.

412
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
I'll think of you as a kitten.

413
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
That's enough!

414
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Fueru wakame becomes wakame if you put it back in water.

415
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
But what happens if you put Matsumoto-san back in water?

416
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
That's right.

417
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
What happens?

418
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
What happens?

419
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
I don't think that's the right way to say it.

420
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
What do you mean by putting him back in water?

421
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
No, it's not like that.

422
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
If you put him in a pool or something, something will happen.

423
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
That won't happen.

424
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
What?

425
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
It won't happen.

426
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
If you put him in water, something will happen.

427
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
That's why I said it would happen.

428
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
You can't say that.

429
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
You did it with Itoi-san before, right?

430
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Fishing, right?

431
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Black bass.

432
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Why didn't you run away then?

433
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
You had a chance.

434
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
No, I didn't.

435
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
You had to hold my yohane and put it in like this.

436
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
You can't run away like that.

437
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
You can't run away like that.

438
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Who told you to run away like that?

439
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Why did you have to hold my yohane and put it in like that?

440
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Then I would have gone like this.

441
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
No, no, no, no.

442
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
That's a temporary form.

443
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
What are you?

444
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
If you do this, you can run away, right?

445
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
What are you?

446
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
What are you?

447
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
You're changing your position.

448
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I'm your partner.

449
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I was killed by the river.

450
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
What is this?

451
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
What are you at this time?

452
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
I'm your partner.

453
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
No, no, no, no.

454
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
If you were my partner, you wouldn't have run away like this.

455
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Why?

456
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
What are you at this time?

457
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
That's why I'm your partner.

458
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,000
I'm your classmate, your friend, and your partner.

459
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
That's why you're my partner up to this point.

460
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Right?

461
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,000
What are you when I talk to you?

462
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
I'm your partner.

463
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Why?

464
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
That's strange.

465
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Why?

466
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
You run away like this.

467
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Wait a minute.

468
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Don't you need a partner who runs away like this?

469
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
It's okay to have such a partner.

470
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
You're an idiot.

471
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
There's no way.

472
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
I'll tell you something.

473
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
You don't have to do this for the rest of your life.

474
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Then I won't run away.

475
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
That's why.

476
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Maybe.

477
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Someone doesn't know that.

478
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Wait.

479
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Wait for me.

480
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Well, well, well.

481
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
I was smoking here.

482
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
When I looked at it, someone was like this.

483
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
What are you going to do if you don't make it in time?

484
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
I'm all alone.

485
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
But I'm sure you'll come back.

486
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
With a lot of eggs.

487
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Don't come back.

488
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
I feel bad.

489
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
With eggs?

490
00:23:53,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Don't you feel bad?
