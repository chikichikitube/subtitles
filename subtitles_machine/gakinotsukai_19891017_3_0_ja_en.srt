1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
We're going to a lot of places.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hello, good evening.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Today, we're going to Azabu shopping street.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
There are a lot of foreigners here.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
There are a lot of them.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Really?

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I'm good at English.

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Let's talk to them.

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Hello.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
That's not right.

11
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
What?

12
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
You're good at English, so you should say it in English.

13
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
How about this?

14
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
That's not right at all.

15
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I think it's good for the show.

16
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I wonder if they'll talk to us more.

17
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
How about the rice cracker?

18
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Oh, tanuki.

19
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Oh, they're baking it here.

20
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
That's right.

21
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
They're baking it here.

22
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Oh, this sound.

23
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
That's right.

24
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
This is the sound.

25
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
This person.

26
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Yes.

27
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Is this person dead?

28
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
That's not right.

29
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
No, not yet.

30
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Yui Asaka is next to her, right?

31
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Yui Asaka is dead, right?

32
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
That's not right.

33
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
When she did the rice cracker in the drama.

34
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
That's right.

35
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
She died or something.

36
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I see.

37
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
That's right.

38
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Are you a otaku?

39
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
What?

40
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Otaku.

41
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
We're otaku.

42
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
We're otaku.

43
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
We're called B21.

44
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
One of us is off today.

45
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Shin is off right now.

46
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Yes.

47
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I'm Hiromi.

48
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Yes.

49
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm Hiromi.

50
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Wow, there's no one here.

51
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
What is this place?

52
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
What are you doing?

53
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Camera-san, you'd better stop it.

54
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Oh, it's raining.

55
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
You'd better stop it.

56
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
This is the tail.

57
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Now, let's look at the venue.

58
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Let's do our best today.

59
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I wonder what kind of stage it is.

60
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
It's not over yet.

61
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
What?

62
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I'll take you down to the bottom.

63
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
We're all going to be in a bag.

64
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
What kind of staff is there?

65
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
It's not over yet.

66
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
It's not over yet.

67
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
What?

68
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Is this okay?

69
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
It's scary.

70
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I'm going to take you down to the bottom and surprise you with a local person you know.

71
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
A local person?

72
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
It's a container.

73
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Oh.

74
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
This is today's stage.

75
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
No, but this is...

76
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
The sound has become brighter, hasn't it?

77
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I'm glad.

78
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
This is the first time I've heard this on this show.

79
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I've never heard it before.

80
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Today, we're going to start with the container.

81
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
We're not going to use the machine, so we're going to record it.

82
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Please take your time.

83
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Ladies and gentlemen.

84
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Good evening, everyone.

85
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Today, we're going to study the words.

86
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
A.

87
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Let's study about A.

88
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
There are many things about A.

89
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
We don't know anything about it.

90
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
We're doing research on A.

91
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Let me introduce you to a teacher.

92
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Here she is.

93
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Ms. Uehara Yoyogi.

94
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Nice to meet you.

95
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
She's a student of my research.

96
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
She's in front of you.

97
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Nice to meet you.

98
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Ms. Masashime.

99
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:54,000
This is the A that comes to your mind.

100
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Thank you very much.

101
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Next is the A that comes to your mind when you're thinking about something.

Ms. Masashime.

103
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
You've already done it.

104
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Next is the A that comes to your mind when you're thinking about something.

105

Next is the A that comes to your mind when you're thinking about something.

107
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I see.

108
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Isn't it strange?

109
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
It's correct.

110
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Please.

111
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Next is the A that comes to your mind when you're thinking about something.

112

114
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Next is the A that comes to your mind when you're thinking about something.

115
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Please listen carefully.

116
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:30,000
The A that comes to your mind when you're thinking about something.

117
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Ms. Masashime.

118
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I'm sorry.

119
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I'm running out of time.

120
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I see.

121
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Next is the A that comes to your mind when you're thinking about something.

122
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000

I'm running out of time.

125
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I'm running out of time.

126
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Good evening, everyone.

127
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Today, I'm going to make the A that comes to your mind when you're thinking about something.

128
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Let's think about it together.

129
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Now, let me introduce you.

130
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Researcher Mi.

131
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Ms. Akasaka Mitsuke.

132
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
How are you doing?

133
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Well then, Ms. Mitsuke.

134
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Please present the results of your research in front of everyone.

135
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
First of all,

136
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:37,000
the A that comes to your mind when you're thinking about something.

137
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:43,000
The A.

138
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Ms. Masashime.

139
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I'm sorry.

140
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I'm running out of time.

141
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,000

00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Good evening, everyone.

147
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
You don't have to be calm all the time.

148
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Today,

149
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I'm going to make the A that comes to your mind when you're thinking about something.

150
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Let's think about it together.

151
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Now, let me introduce you.

152
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:33,000
The Philippine Researcher, Mr. Gyohei Shinjuku.

153
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Today,

154
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I'm going to present the results of my research in front of everyone.

155
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
First of all,

156
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
the A that comes to your mind when you're thinking about something.

157
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:55,000
The A that comes to your mind when you're thinking about something.

158
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,000
The Philippine Researcher.

159
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I'm sorry.

160
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I'm running out of time.

161
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
The Philippine Researcher.

162
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I'm sorry.

163
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,000
The Philippine Researcher.

164
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Next week,

165
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I'm going to make the A that comes to your mind when you're thinking about something.

166
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Let's say goodbye to Mr. Gyohei Shinjuku.

167
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Thank you very much.

168
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Goodbye.

169
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Thank you very much.

170
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I didn't mean to change anything.

171
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I'm glad I could talk like this.

172
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Well, today.

173
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I feel like my face is getting tanned today.

174
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Why?

175
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I feel like I'm doing something stupid.

176
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
If you feel stupid, look at me.

177
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
It's weird, isn't it?

178
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
What the hell is the Philippine?

179
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
What the hell is the Philippine?

180
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Because I keep thinking about the other me.

181
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
When I was doing that story.

182
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
When I was told that I was doing a Philippine research,

183
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I was reminded of the Philippine.

184
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
And I was thinking of the other me.

185
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
No way. No way.

186
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
No way. No way.

187
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I'm laughing when I'm thinking of the other me.

188
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
No one is laughing at me.

189
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Today's story was a little short.

190
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
That's right.

191
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I did a research on a story I'm good at.

192
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
It's been a while.

193
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
It's true.

194
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
The number of audience is a little less than usual.

195
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
This is the best.

196
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Isn't it just right?

197
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I always say that kind of thing.

198
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
What's wrong with this program?

199
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
It's not girly at all.

200
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
That's right.

201
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Right?

202
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
For example,

203
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Even with a microphone.

204
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
That's right.

205
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
This kind of thing.

206
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
It's okay if a girl comes out.

207
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
This kind of thing.

208
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
It's really like the rubber of Utopia.

209
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
This kind of thing.

210
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
You are also against it.

211
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
That kind of thing.

212
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
That kind of thing.

213
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
So, for example,

214
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Asking for an assistant.

215
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Asking for an assistant.

216
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
That's good.

217
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Right?

218
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Let's ask for an assistant.

219
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Yes.

220
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
That kind of thing that doesn't go home at all.

221
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
That's good.

222
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
That kind,

223
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Of science always,

224
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
That kind,

225
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
We will be walking with a sleeping bag on our back.

226
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
That kind of things.

227
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
That kind of?

228
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
If you Usually like to use only this,

229
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
What will you do with that.

230
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
It would be okay of assistant,

231
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Girls too.

232
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
But to ask for an assistant,

233
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
aring like this?

234
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Like a man!

235
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Will you choose this?

236
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
By a microphone?

237
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Eh?

238
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I'm receiving a note.

239
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Okay.

240
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
This is very good품, isn't it?

241
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Yes, of course.

242
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
From Nonaka Ariko-san?

243
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Ikuko-san.

244
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Ikuko-san? 19 years old.

245
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Do you two get along well with B21 Special?

246
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Which do you like better, Ucchan Nan-chan or B21 Special?

247
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I hate both of them.

248
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
They both work together.

249
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
They both work together.

250
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
They both work together.

251
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
They both work together.

252
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
they work together.

253
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
They work together at 7 or 8 pm.

254
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
They work together at 7 or 8 pm.

255
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Golden Time, the national online.

256
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
There is a story of two old Japanese people.

257
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Also, the quiz derby is in the back.

258
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
They are strong.

259
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
There is no way I can win.

260
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I saw it earlier, there was a hope for four people.

261
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Even though it's a hope for two.

262
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Even though it's a hope for two.

263
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Even though it's a hope for two.

264
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
They write down I really want to go.

265
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
In a highlighter.

266
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
If you can't do it, there are two of you.

267
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
What is this?

268
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
What is this?

269
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
What is this?

270
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Just say it!

271
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I got a little weak for a moment.

272
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I thought it would be bad if I was told that I can't do it.

273
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
If you can't do it, there are two of you.

274
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
It was interesting.

275
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
If you look at the news, it says,

276
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
It says,

277
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
It says,

278
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
It says,

279
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
It says,

280
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
It says,

281
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
It says,

282
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:11,000
It says,

283
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
It says,

284
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
It says,

285
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:22,000
It says,

286
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I don't really watch it.

287
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:30,000
If it's a long show, you can just say something like,

288
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
something that's easy for everyone to say.

289
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I don't watch downtown.

290
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
That's not it.

291
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
It's downtown.

292
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Where are you going to summarize it?

293
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Seriously, I don't watch it.

294
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:52,000
On the radio and live, it's a place where you can hear a lot of harsh words, but on TV you can't really see the fun in it.

295
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Since we're doing a show at night, I expect you to be able to get the most out of it.

296
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Are you trying to crush me?

297
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
We've only just started.

298
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Right?

299
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
It's late at night, so you're allowed to say a little bit.

300
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
How long should I say it's late at night?

301
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Hmm...

302
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
If it's harsh words, you can say,

303
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
You can say it's like a golden egg.

304
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
A golden egg.

305
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
From now on, when you're talking, you can say it's like a golden egg.

306
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
What do you think?

307
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Like the missu-zu from Hana-no-Oen-dan.

308
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I can only tell by the sound.

309
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Have you gotten used to Tokyo?

310
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I don't think I've gotten used to it.

311
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,000
The distance between Osaka and Tokyo is really hard.

312
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Why?

313
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
There are only two options at that time.

314
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
You can take the Shinkansen or the plane.

315
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I don't like either.

316
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I don't know what to do.

317
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Which is better, the plane or the Shinkansen?

318
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
The Shinkansen is better.

319
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
It's easier.

320
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
The plane is no good.

321
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
You can take the Shinkansen slowly,

322
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
but if the person next to you or the person behind you is a terrible person,

323
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
it's going to be three hours of trouble.

324
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
There are annoying people.

325
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
The monkey family.

326
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
The monkey family?

327
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
The other day,

328
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
there were two people lined up,

329
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
and there was a seat next to them.

330
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
The husband and wife,

331
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
and probably the husband's mother was a grandmother.

332
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
There were two grandmothers and two children.

333
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
And the children were screaming.

334
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
And the children,

335
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I remember them screaming.

336
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
That's right.

337
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I've been thinking about it for three hours.

338
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
During that time,

339
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:46,000
me and Matsumoto were pretending to sleep like this.

340
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000
The monkey grandmother didn't say anything.

341
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,000
The grandmother didn't say anything.

342
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
After all,

343
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
she was very angry.

344
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Why?

345
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
She was on the Shinkansen.

346
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
She was on the Shinkansen.

347
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
There was a grandmother who loved the monkey family.

348
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
There was a father and a mother.

349
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,000
There was an ice cream in front of them.

350
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Shut up!

351
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Shut up!

352
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
They were so angry.

353
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
It was really amazing.

354
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
They were screaming.

355
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
The mother didn't say anything,

356
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
but the grandmother said,

357
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,000
It's annoying, so be quiet.

358
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
It was really amazing.

359
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
It was my fault.

360
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I probably should have held the monkey's hair.

361
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Shut up!

362
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I probably should have held his face.

363
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Shut up!

364
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I was angry.

365
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:41,380
On the day of the

366
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
children's holiday,

367
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
everyone was carrying too many children on the Shinkansen.

368
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
That's right.

369
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
In the past, children couldn't ride the Shinkansen.

370
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
The children were so angry that they couldn't ride the Shinkansen.

371
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
The monkey grandmother was screaming.

372
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
The Shinkansen children ate a lot.

373
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,000
They rode the Shinkansen from Tokyo for three hours.

374
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
When they arrived in Osaka,

375
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
they became a little bigger.

376
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
They became a little bigger.

377
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
They had a voice.

378
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
What did they eat?

379
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
What did they eat?

380
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
What did they eat?

381
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Did they eat ice cream?

382
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Did they eat eel?

383
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Shut up!

384
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,000
What did the monkey grandmother say?

385
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
She looked like a fool.

386
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,000
The monkey grandmother looked like a fool.

387
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
The monkey grandmother looked like a fool.

388
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
It was my fault.

389
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
The airplane was scary.

390
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
No matter how noisy the airplane was,

391
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
it was better to ride the Shinkansen than the airplane.

392
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
You were scared.

393
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I was scared.

394
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Why?

395
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
You were scared just by shaking a little.

396
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
When I got on the Shinkansen,

397
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I decided to fall.

398
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I thought it was impossible.

399
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
When I got on the Shinkansen,

400
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
the monkey grandmother said,

401
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Welcome.

402
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I thought,

403
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Is that the monkey grandmother?

404
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Is that the monkey grandmother?

405
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I was scared.

406
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
My family was on the Shinkansen.

407
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
My mother wanted to eat a candy.

408
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
My mother said,

409
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Please wait until you get on the Shinkansen.

410
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I was surprised.

411
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
You are laughing.

412
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Why are you laughing?

413
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
The Shinkansen has a tarp.

414
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
There are 2 tarps.

415
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
You shouldn't ride from the front.

416
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Why?

417
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
If you ride from the front,

418
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
you can't see the pilot's face.

419
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
There was a time when Mr. Yasui was there.

420
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
The pilot was on the tarp and was yawning.

421
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
He went into the cockpit and played.

422
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Don't say that.

423
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
You are risking a person's life.

424
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Why are you yawning?

425
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I don't get it at all.

426
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
It's better not to see the pilot's face.

427
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Why?

428
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
If the pilot is a man, it's safe.

429
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
If he's a kid, right?

430
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
If he has a face like a thin sword, it's like,

431
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Are you okay?

432
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
The guy who got on the plane before,

433
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
He looks like KENSHI TAKAMI.

434
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Are you okay?

435
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I'm scared.

436
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
It can't be helped.

437
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
What about food?

438
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:27,000
I like Osaka food, but I don't like Osaka food.

439
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I don't think Osaka food is that good.

440
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Have you ever been to Tokyo?

441
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I've been there.

442
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I was surprised.

443
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I've been there.

444
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:43,000
There was a game on the iron plate.

445
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I ate this deliciously with a small iron plate.

446
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
These guys, these guys.

447
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
This is a little...

448
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
What's a small iron plate?

449
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
It's kind of sticky.

450
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
If you like it, it's going to be hard.

451
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
It's going to be hard.

452
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
It's still hard.

453
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
I don't know what it is.

454
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I don't know what it is.

455
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I don't know what it is.

456
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I don't know what it is.

457
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I had a friend in KITA SENJU.

458
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
It's a suburb, isn't it?

459
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:26,000
What kind of Tokyo do you have a friend in KITA SENJU?

460
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
When did you have a friend in KITA SENJU?

461
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
What?

462
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Don't say that kind of thing.

463
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Even if I get hit, I'll never move my face.

464
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
It's strange that Tokyo people like natto.

465
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Do you like natto?

466
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Everyone likes it.

467
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
You don't like it, do you?

468
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Well, there are people like that.

469
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
People in Osaka don't like natto.

470
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
There's nothing I can't eat.

471
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I don't think I'll eat it because I like it.

472
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
I don't think so.

473
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
That smell, that smell.

474
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,000
The smell of natto is the smell of my father's feet.

475
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I can't eat it from now on.

476
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
What's the smell of your father's feet?

477
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,000
When my father comes home, he's sitting in that area.

478
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Do you know how smelly it is?

479
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
My father is smelly.

480
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
He's the third in KITA HANKYU.

481
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
He's smelly.

482
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Tell me the number one.

483
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
My father came home one day and collapsed at the entrance.

484
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Everyone in the family is smelly.

485
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
It's a serious story.

486
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
I had to change my pajamas.

487
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,000
When I changed my pajamas, my father said,

488
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
It's true.

489
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
What is this person?

490
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
My father said,

491
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
When did you fart?

492
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
It's true.

493
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
It's serious.

494
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
There's a lot of things.

495
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Well, thank you very much.

496
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
It's time to say goodbye.

497
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Like I said earlier,

498
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
What if I do this?

499
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
What about that?

500
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I'll tell you what I'm going to do.

501
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
I'll tell you what I'm going to do.

502
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
If you want to be a model,

503
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
I'll give you a picture of my face.

504
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
I'll give you a picture of my face.

505
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Only my face?

506
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Only my face.

507
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,000
My face is cute, but I can't make money by doing this.

508
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Your face is cute, but you look cute in the picture.

509
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,000
But when I look at you, you're a big guy.

510
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
That's hard.

511
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:36,000
There's a lot of highlights on your face.

512
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,000
You're a big guy.

513
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
I'm not a big guy.

514
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I'll be waiting for your comments.

515
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Please send me a lot of letters.

516
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Hello.

517
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Hello.

518
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Good evening.

519
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
It's over.

520
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
It's over.

521
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
How was it today?

522
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
How was it today?

523
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
What do you mean?

524
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:07,000
I thought it would be fun to talk to a lot of people before I came in.

525
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
That's right.

526
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,000
But if there's no one suddenly, it'll be a mess.

527
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I'd like to walk where there's a lot of people.

528
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
It depends on the place.

529
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
That's why I'm doing this show in a lot of places.

530
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,000
I think I can meet a lot of people in a lot of places.

531
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
I think that's a good thing.

532
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
When you came out today, there was a car, right?

533
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
What was that like?

534
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Isn't it good?

535
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
That's about it.

536
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Yeah, it's better than that.

537
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,000
I'll never make the same mistake again in Osaka.

538
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
I'll come out in a month and get a paper tape.

539
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
There was a guy.

540
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
There was a guy in the middle.

541
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
It's funny that only he knew.

542
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:57,000
It's funny that only men know.

543
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Next week, I'd like to go to Soi.

544
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:06,000
I've heard about the place, but I've never been there.

545
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:13,000
I'm talking about a man and a woman right now, but it's not me.

546
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
So next week, I won't forget my menta.

547
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
If you suddenly go, it'll hurt.

548
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
I'll go after I'm done sewing.

549
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
I'm pretty good at it.

550
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
You don't need a mentor?

551
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I don't need one.

552
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Then I'll do it.

553
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
How was it at first?

554
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
It wasn't good at first, but...

555
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:38,000
It's a mess.

556
00:23:38,000 --> 00:24:02,000
There's a lot of opinions, so I don't know what this is about.
