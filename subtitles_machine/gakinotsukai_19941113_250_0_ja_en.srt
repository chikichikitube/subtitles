1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
You came all the way to Matsumoto today, didn't you?

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Yeah, why did you come to a park in the middle of the night when it was so cold?

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Oh, I see.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I didn't expect you to come all the way to Yamazaki.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Do you think I'll be able to sell?

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I didn't expect you to come all the way to Yamazaki.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
If he comes here next time, I'll kick his ass.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
What should I do?

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
You should just go home.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
No, I'm not going home.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Hey!

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
What the hell are you doing?

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
What the hell are you doing?

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000
In the entertainment world, there are two strong men who divide the power of the society.

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
They don't know the amount of blood they shed,

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
and the fight between the two men has deepened the conflict.

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
What the hell are you doing?

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Stop it! Stop it!

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
They don't know what they're afraid of when they're cut off.

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Stop it! Stop it!

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Yamazaki is the fastest to get cut off in the entertainment world.

22
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
He burns the flames of hatred.

23
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Yotani Aimaniel

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
You haven't been on TV lately, have you?

25
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I don't know.

26
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
You know, I'm choosing a job.

27
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
You know, don't choose a job at your level.

28
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
You know, don't choose a job at your level.

29
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
What the hell are you doing?

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Even if you go on TV, the number of people who can't do it is increasing.

31
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
You don't know what they say over there?

32
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
It's a technical term.

33
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
What the hell are they saying over there?

34
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
That's not good. That idiot.

35
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Isn't that the first time in your life that you've been cut off?

36
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Don't say that.

37
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Stop it, stop it.

38
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Stop it

39
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Which one is stronger?

40
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I won't lose

41
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Wait

42
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Stop it

43
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Stop it

44
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Stop it

45
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
This program is brought to you by these sponsors

46
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Yamazaki, you are amazing

47
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
What can you do?

48
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I can...

49
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I can put this cigarette on my back

50
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
What?

51
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
You can do that?

52
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Put it on

53
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Yes

54
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Why did you say yes?

55
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Why did you answer?

56
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
It's burning

57
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
It's burning

58
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
My back is burning

59
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Look

60
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
It's not burning

61
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Look

62
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Look

63
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I can put this cigarette on my back

64
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Are you stupid?

65
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Right?

66
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Look

67
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Stop it

68
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Why?

69
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I won't lose

70
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Really?

71
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Yamazaki, you can't put this cigarette on your back

72
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
It's hot

73
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
It's hot

74
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
It's hot

75
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
It's a cigarette

76
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
It's frozen

77
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
It's like a spring

78
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I will be more interesting than Yamazaki

79
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Let's go

80
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
It's hot

81
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:30,000
It's cold

82
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Yamazaki, you are amazing

83
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
What can you do?

84
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I have a brain

85
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
After that

86
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I will wash it with a firework shower

87
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
It's hot

88
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
My head is burning

89
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Can I touch it?

90
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Can I touch it?

91
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
It's scary

92
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
It's scary

93
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I don't have a brain

94
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Yamazaki

95
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
You are teasing your juniors again

96
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I don't do it because I want to

97
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Thank you for saying that

98
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
One more time

99
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I don't do it because I want to

100
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Can you show us?

101
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:31,000
It's scary

102
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Faster

103
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
It's sticky

104
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
It's too short to stay

105
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I let Jimmy go

106
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
He stays until he stops

107
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
What are you doing?

108
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,000
It's a human

109
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I did it

110
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Look at the camera

111
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Look at me

112
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Jimmy

113
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
You do it because you like it

114
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I don't do it because I like it

115
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
You do it

116
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I don't do it

117
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
You did it

118
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
You came here

119
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I didn't do it

120
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I don't do it

121
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
It was long

122
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
It was long

123
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
You look like you are wearing a see-through

124
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Look at me

125
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I do what I do

126
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Let's do it again

127
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Look at this

128
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
It's a tank

129
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
You can escape with this

130
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
You can escape

131
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Are you serious?

132
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Yamazaki

133
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Look at me

134
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Speak in honorifics

135
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Do you understand?

136
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
You are a senior

137
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I did everything

138
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I see

139
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
You are taking him

140
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
No

141
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I don't do it

142
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Do you understand?

143
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I'm going

144
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Who are you talking to?

145
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
You are talking to me

146
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Who are you talking to?

147
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Issei

148
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
It's coming

149
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Your face

150
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
It's beautiful

151
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
No

152
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
It's wonderful

153
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
You can't do it

154
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
What?

155
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
You can't do it

156
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I went into the water

157
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I went into the sleeping bag

158
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I can't escape

159
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Are you serious?

160
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Yes

161
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
It's dangerous

162
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
It's dangerous

163
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I forgive you

164
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
It's the last time

165
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Are you okay?

166
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I'm okay

167
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I don't know if I'll die

168
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Don't worry

169
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I'm sorry

170
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I'm sorry

171
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I'm going to change my clothes

172
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
It's like a see-through

173
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Jimmy

174
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
If you come with this

175
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Yes

176
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Don't use honorifics

177
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I don't understand

178
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
It seems

179
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Let's go

180
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I can't escape

181
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Your face is ugly

182
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
What are you doing?

183
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
We won

184
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Really?

185
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
What?

186
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Let's say we have the same score

187
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Really?

188
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
It means we still have the same score

189
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Really?

190
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I don't know

191
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
We're going home

192
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Bye

193
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Remember next time

194
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
You too

195
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Did you just say that to me?

196
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Yes

197
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:36,000
It's a joke

198
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Ladies and gentlemen

199
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
It's a little too early

200
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Today is your first time in Seoul

201
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Yes

202
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I heard that

203
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Why?

204
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
The truth is

205
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
The fool did it

206
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
The fool did it

207
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
The fool did it

208
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
He does it usually

209
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
He's a fool

210
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Why is he like this?

211
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
He did it with his whole body

212
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I see

213
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I did a lot of research

214
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
You did research

215
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Do you know what research I did?

216
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Not at all

217
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Genetic engineering

218
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Recently

219
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I couldn't solve it

220
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I did a new research

221
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
What kind of research?

222
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I can't tell you

223
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Why?

224
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I want to tell you

225
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
What kind of research?

226
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I did research on comedians

227
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I see

228
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
This is interesting

229
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I did research

230
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
So what?

231
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
You can't tell me

232
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I can't tell you

233
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
You can't tell me the result of your research

234
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I can't tell you

235
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
You can't tell me

236
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
It's an interesting movement

237
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
It's popular

238
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
What's popular?

239
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
It should be popular

240
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I'm going to be called a fashion leader

241
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I see

242
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
The result of your research

243
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I don't know if I should laugh

244
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
It's amazing

245
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
A popular comedian

246
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
A popular comedian

247
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
It's similar to life judgment

248
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
A popular comedian

249
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Has a poem

250
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
What do you mean?

251
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Why does it have a poem?

252
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
His name has a poem

253
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
What are you saying?

254
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Wait

255
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Wait

256
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
You are a poet

257
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Don't say that

258
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Don't say that

259
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
You are a poet

260
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I'm not the only one

261
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
A popular comedian always has a poem

262
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
There's no mistake

263
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Why didn't you notice this?

264
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Who else?

265
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I'm a poet

266
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
This is

267
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
What is this?

268
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
What is this?

269
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I know

270
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Hamada Masato

271
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
He has a poem

272
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
He has a poem

273
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I don't know

274
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I don't know

275
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Ask me anything

276
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Who else?

277
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Let's think

278
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Who else?

279
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Let's think

280
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
It's not a problem

281
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Why?

282
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Masato is a poet

283
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
There's a question

284
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Where does the poem come from?

285
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
There's a question

286
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
There's a question

287
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
There's a poem

288
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Shimada Shinsuke

289
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
There's a poem

290
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
There's a poem

291
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Takeshi

292
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Who else?

293
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
By the way, what's your zodiac sign?

294
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
It's G

295
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
It's G in April

296
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Wait

297
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
It's G?

298
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Of course it's G

299
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
You should have told me first

300
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
You are C

301
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
C is not G

302
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I wanted to throw out this research

303
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I wanted to throw out this research

304
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
What are you talking about?

305
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
It's not

306
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
What's going to happen to Tamori?

307
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
What's going to happen to Tamori?

308
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Morita Kazuyoshi

309
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
That's his real name

310
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I see

311
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
What?

312
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Uchan Nanchan?

313
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Uchimura Teruyoshi

314
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
That's good

315
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
What about Aikata?

316
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
What?

317
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
What about Aikata?

318
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
When I realized that

319
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
What are you talking about?

320
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I thought

321
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Nanchan is not included

322
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I thought

323
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Wait

324
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Don't stop

325
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
What?

326
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Aikata

327
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
That's why I thought

328
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
The combination

329
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I don't know

330
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
It's okay

331
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
That's okay

332
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
If you do a combination

333
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
That's okay

334
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
That's okay

335
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Everyone will be fine

336
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
There's nothing left

337
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
There's no G

338
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
There's no combination

339
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
There's no more

340
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
What about him?

341
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:02,000
It doesn't matter

342
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
It's not bad

343
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
It's not bad

344
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
It's not bad

345
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
It's not bad

346
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Hiromi

347
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Hiromi

348
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
B21

349
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
B21

350
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
B21

351
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Kamio Kari Utaro

352
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Kamio Kari Utaro

353
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Kamio Kari Utaro

354
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
You mean Master?

355
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
You said it to the name

356
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
In the name

357
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
In the name

358
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I was told that he was a bad guy.

359
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
That's strange.

360
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
He has everything.

361
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Is there anyone else?

362
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
It's not selling.

363
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Ma-chan is so bad at jokes.

364
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
What are you talking about?

365
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
See? Everyone is dead before the camp is over.

366
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Try to remember!

367
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Ootake Makoto.

368
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
City Boys.

369
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Let's go with Drifters.

370
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Drifters?

371
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Drifters, right?

372
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
That's so sudden.

373
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
It's definitely Shimura Ken.

374
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Nakamoto Koji.

375
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Nakamoto.

376
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Kato.

377
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Sakagibu.

378
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
You know what I'm talking about, right?

379
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
What about Kato-chan?

380
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
It's Kato-chan.

381
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
It's different from his name.

382
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Even if he is laughed at,

383
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
his name has nothing to do with it.

384
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:14,000
He is really bad at jokes.

385
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,000
My research will continue to develop in various fields.

386
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
It's wild.

387
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
It's wild in the middle.

388
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Like this.

389
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
He is putting it in.

390
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:35,000
He is putting it in the necktie.

391
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
It's not moving.

392
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Are you going to cut it?

393
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:59,000
This is going to be cut.

394
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Yesterday, when we were shooting for Gottsu,

395
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Takeda Tetsuya-san was there, right?

396
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Yes, yes.

397
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
His shoulders were stiff,

398
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
so he was rubbing his shoulders to the staff.

399
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
When I saw him, I said,

400
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Oh, good morning.

401
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:22,000
He was rubbing his shoulders.

402
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Hey, you should be careful.

403
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Why?

404
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
It's about your daily life,

405
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
so you might not feel it at all,

406
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
but if you look at it from a third-party perspective,

407
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
he was rubbing his shoulders like this.

408
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Why are you doing that?

409
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Wait.

410
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Ah, ah.

411
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Can you speak?

412
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Today's guest,

413
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Ah, ah.

414
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Ah, ah.

415
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Speak.

416
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Ah, ah, ah.

417
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Speak.

418
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Ah, ah.

419
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
I'm watching it, so it's fine,

420
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
but if you don't know it,

421
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
you look really great.

422
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
So, I went to a store,

423
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
well, what, disco,

424
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
well, I haven't been to it recently,

425
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
and everyone was sitting like this.

426
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
That chair is low.

427
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Everyone was fine.

428
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
When a talent like me is sitting like this,

429
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
people say,

430
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Matsumoto Ita is wearing this,

431
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
and he looks great.

432
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
But you can't do it with both hands.

433
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
But I can do this.

434
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
When I go to the neighborhood,

435
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
it's like this.

436
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
You'll get hit.

437
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
He doesn't have that kind of spirit.

438
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
That's right.

439
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
It really hurts my head,

440
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
so I rub my shoulders and hold my chest.

441
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Well,

442
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
I don't think that your rubbing shoulders

443
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
are basically dead.

444
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Why?

445
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
He's rubbing his shoulders.

446
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Oh, that's enough.

447
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
No, no, no.

448
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Touch it.

449
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
In the end,

450
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Touch it.

451
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Don't touch it.

452
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
No, it's fine.

453
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
No, it's fine.

454
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
He's rubbing his shoulders.

455
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,000
It's your morning.

456
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Tell me what happens

457
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
when you mix something

458
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
that says don't mix.

459
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Tell me what happens when you mix something

460
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
that says don't mix.

461
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Oxygen and oxygen.

462
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Speak clearly.

463
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
You won't sell that much.

464
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Speak out.

465
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Oxygen and oxygen.

466
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Oxygen and oxygen.

467
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Oxygen and oxygen.

468
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Yes, yes, yes.

469
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
You just figured it out, didn't you?

470
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
The detergent is

471
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
oxygen.

472
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
It's oxygen.

473
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Oxygen?

474
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Why is the detergent oxygen?

475
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Can't you say it properly?

476
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Can't you say it properly?

477
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Mom, dad, don't get angry.

478
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Anyway,

479
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Yes?

480
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
That's fine.

481
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
What?

482
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Is that fine?

483
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Is that fine?

484
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Of course, I've experienced everything.

485
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Don't mix.

486
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Don't mix.

487
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Of course, I've experienced everything.

488
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I've experienced everything.

489
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Oh.

490
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
It's from the sesame seeds.

491
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
I've been with you all this time.

492
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Please put in my favorite scanty.

493
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
I got it.

494
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
It's all over the place.

495
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
It's hard to take it off.

496
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Oh, sticky pants?

497
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Sticky pants.

498
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
A year of embarrassing sticky pants.

499
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
That's embarrassing.

500
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
A year that I got from my parents.

501
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Sticky pants.

502
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Why would your parents give you sticky pants?

503
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Sticky pants that gave birth to life from my parents.

504
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
If you say it like that,

505
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Sticky pants that your parents gave you.

506
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Don't you think they're great parents?

507
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
A bright red body from my parents.

508
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
How do you know that?

509
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Sticky pants.

510
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
I put it in.

511
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
I put it in.

512
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
I put detergent in.

513
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
It's dangerous to mix with that.

514
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I put this in.

515
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
I thought it was going to explode.

516
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
What did you put in?

517
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
That's why I put that in.

518
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
I put in something that's said to be dangerous to mix with.

519
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
That's enough.

520
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
I thought it was going to explode.

521
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
It didn't explode.

522
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
It didn't explode.

523
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
But?

524
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Yes.

525
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
What kind of phenomenon happened?

526
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
I don't know.

527
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
I can't even predict after this.

528
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
At this time, I didn't even want to know.

529
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
I know.

530
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Tell me quickly.

531
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
What is it?

532
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
What is it?

533
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Don't think about it. I want to see it.

534
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Sticky pants that your parents gave you.

535
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
It became a camisole.

536
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
It became a camisole.

537
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
It's magic.

538
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Mr. Matsumoto is good at singing, dancing, and his face is also good.

539
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Why isn't it Johnny's?

540
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
I'll ask him.

541
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
I didn't want to go to Johnny's.

542
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:33,000
I'll answer seriously.
