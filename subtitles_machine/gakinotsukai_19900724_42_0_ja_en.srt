1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Chikichiki Chibikko at the Akinotsukaia area?

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:07,000
Anything is fine!

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Applause!

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Well done!

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Then, I'll call two kind teachers who will answer your questions.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Hamada Masatoshi-sensei!

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Yay!

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Nice to meet you!

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Nice to meet you!

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
And Matsumoto Hitoshi-sensei!

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Then, we...

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Yes, please sit down.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Nice to meet you!

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
That was fun, wasn't it?

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
That's all for today.

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Shall we start?

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Then, please raise your hands and ask your questions.

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Yes!

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Then, I'll go first.

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm Sugawara Yugo, 5th grade.

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
What's your question?

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Well...

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Humans are dead.

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
When humans die, they go to heaven and hell.

25
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Is there really heaven and hell?

26
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
That's my question.

27
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Ah, I see.

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Thank you.

29
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
What's with this guy?

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Heaven and hell...

31
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Is there really heaven and hell?

32
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Is there really?

33
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Don't mess with me!

34
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
There's a difference between heaven and hell.

35
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Ah, depending on the person's face?

36
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Yes, yes.

37
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
What about his face?

38
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
It's hell, isn't it?

39
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
It's not like that, but...

40
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
You have to do something bad.

41
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
If you don't do something bad, you won't go to hell.

42
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Do you understand?

43
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Yes.

44
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Thank you very much.

45
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Let's go to the next one.

46
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Then, I'll go.

47
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
10th grade.

48
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I'm Akutsuryu.

49
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I'm a second grader.

50
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Hello.

51
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Why is the Earth round?

52
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Really?

53
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I'm Kamaiko.

54
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I'm a second grader.

55
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
What is a pendulum?

56
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
You have a father, right?

57
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
You have a mother, right?

58
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Yes.

59
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
And your father...

60
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
really likes this.

61
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Do you understand?

62
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Other than my mother,

63
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
my father really likes this.

64
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Most of the time,

65
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
your father likes women.

66
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Since your mother is the only one,

67
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
it would be nice if you could focus on your mother.

68
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
But...

69
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Even if you put it in your eyes,

70
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
your father really likes this.

71
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Does your father come home from time to time?

72
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
No, he doesn't.

73
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Really?

74
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
If your father doesn't come home from time to time,

75
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
raise your hand.

76
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Yes.

77
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
He does.

78
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
That's bad, but...

79
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
That's for sure.

80
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
He does it whenever he gets the chance.

81
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
He does it whenever he gets the chance.

82
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
To put it simply,

83
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
if your father doesn't come home from time to time,

84
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
let's just call him Furin.

85
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
It's easy to understand.

86
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
That's how it is.

87
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Do you understand?

88
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Yes.

89
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Okay, let's go over there.

90
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Okay.

91
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Let's go over there.

92
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Okay.

93
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Stand up.

94
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I'm Mayuko Doi. I'm a 4th grader.

95
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I want to be a talent,

96
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
but please come up with a good name for me.

97
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
What was your school name?

98
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Doi Mayuko.

99
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Doi Mayuko.

100
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I see.

101
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
It's Shoufukutei Mayuko.

102
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Are you talking to me?

103
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Stand up.

104
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Touch me.

105
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I don't want to.

106
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Don't say you don't want to.

107
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Come on.

108
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Do you want a microphone?

109
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
What is it?

110
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I'm Naoki Matsunaga.

111
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Naoki Matsunaga?

112
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Yes.

113
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
What is it?

114
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Do you like Naoki?

115
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I like him.

116
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
That's why you've been touching me all this time.

117
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
What?

118
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Do you want an older brother?

119
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Hello.

120
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Hello.

121
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
This is the first time I've been on a train.

122
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I knew it was going to be crowded.

123
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I took the Keio line.

124
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
You came on the train, but you were late.

125
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Normally, if I came by taxi, I'd be here by 6.30.

126
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
But I came on the train.

127
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
What time did you arrive at Tokyo Station?

128
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
About 4.50.

129
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
What time did you arrive here?

130
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
5 o'clock.

131
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Why did you arrive at Tokyo Station at 4.50?

132
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Listen to me.

133
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
What?

134
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
You're not supposed to be here at 5.00.

135
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Why did you arrive at Tokyo Station at 4.50?

136
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
This is...

137
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
This is the 5th most mysterious train in the world.

138
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
What are you talking about?

139
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
You're late again today.

140
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I'm not late.

141
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I was here at 5.00.

142
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I'm not here.

143
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I was here.

144
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Are you stupid?

145
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
You were here at 6.00.

146
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I was eating ramen in front of you.

147
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Don't lie.

148
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
It's true.

149
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I ate ramen in Sapporo.

150
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
You saw me passing by, right?

151
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
No, I really ate it.

152
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Mushroom ramen.

153
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
You were late and you still ate ramen?

154
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Of course.

155
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
What?

156
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
What?

157
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Give it to me.

158
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
What is it?

159
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Juice.

160
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Give it to me.

161
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Give it to me.

162
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Give it to me.

163
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Give it to me.

164
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
What is it?

165
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
The All-Star game.

166
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
The fan vote.

167
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I'm showing the top players in each position.

168
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
This way.

169
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Yes.

170
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Right?

171
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
What are we going to do with this?

172
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Yes.

173
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
So, this year's All-Star.

174
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Which team will win?

175
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Let's bet on this one.

176
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Yes.

177
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
The one who loses will be punished.

178
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
But if I do this, I'll definitely have an advantage.

179
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
You don't know baseball, do you?

180
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Chromaty.

181
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Chromaty?

182
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
What kind of foreigner is this?

183
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Of course.

184
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Sorry.

185
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Chromaty.

186
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Chromaty, right?

187
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I know him.

188
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Right?

189
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Yes.

190
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I don't know him at all.

191
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
He's a top player.

192
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Yes, yes.

193
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
So, we'll see who wins.

194
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
We have to make this clear.

195
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
And if you lose, what will you do?

196
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I'll be punished.

197
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
This time it's amazing.

198
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
What is it?

199
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
It's a huge spectacle.

200
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
This punishment game.

201
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
That's right.

202
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
You always say it yourself, but you don't do it yourself.

203
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I don't really care about that.

204
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
This time it's amazing.

205
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
What is it?

206
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Right?

207
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
What is it?

208
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Skydiving.

209
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,000
It's really high.

210
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
This is it.

211
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I'll do my best.

212
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I don't want to.

213
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I really don't want to do it.

214
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I don't want to.

215
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
If you lose, it's a punishment game.

216
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
You can't say, I did it.

217
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I'll do something I don't want to do.

218
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
If you lose, I'll do something I don't want to do.

219
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I won't stop.

220
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I'll do it.

221
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Really?

222
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Yes.

223
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I'll do it.

224
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Alone?

225
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Yes.

226
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
You'll do it alone?

227
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I'll do it.

228
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I really don't want to do it.

229
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
If I do it, I'll do it with a sheet.

230
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
You're really something.

231
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
This is interesting.

232
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
What is it?

233
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
If I do it with a sheet...

234
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I don't go to high places at all.

235
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Really?

236
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
If you do it, you can do that.

237
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
You can do it with a jump rope.

238
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Moreover, you can open it with this part.

239
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I'll die.

240
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
If you don't agree with it...

241
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
It's scary.

242
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
It's really scary.

243
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
If you don't do that...

244
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
There are wide places.

245
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
If you run like this...

246
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
There are a lot of fish.

247
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Are you stupid?

248
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
There's a scene in Kamen Rider.

249
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
That's a dead horse.

250
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
If you just say, go through here...

251
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
You can run there.

252
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
That's not interesting.

253
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
You're stupid.

254
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
There's a road in the movie.

255
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
You can walk on the edge.

256
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
That's cool.

257
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
If you go to the toilet...

258
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
You have to poop.

259
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
If you go to the toilet...

260
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
It's dirty.

261
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
If you go to the toilet...

262
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
You have to poop.

263
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
That's cool.

264
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
It's not cool.

265
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
But it's not scary.

266
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
It's not scary.

267
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
But it's not cool.

268
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I think that's better.

269
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
If you go like this...

270
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
If you go like this...

271
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
If you go like this...

272
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
That's better.

273
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
That's better.

274
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
That's the opening.

275
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
You're stupid.

276
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Why did you put them together?

277
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
This time, it's the best.

278
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
That's the best.

279
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
You're stupid.

280
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
What's the best?

281
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
The one who loses.

282
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I don't want to do it.

283
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
It's impossible to do it alone.

284
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Who's going to do it?

285
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I'll do it.

286
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I'll do it.

287
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
The one who follows me.

288
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I'll do it.

289
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
And you'll do it.

290
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I'll do it.

291
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I won't do it.

292
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I won't say it's okay.

293
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
But it's better than doing it alone.

294
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Which one?

295
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I'll do it or not?

296
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Wait.

297
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Don't say it like I'll do it.

298
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
If you lose, you'll do it.

299
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
If I lose, I'll do it too.

300
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
You really do it?

301
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Yes.

302
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I'll do it.

303
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
But in my case...

304
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I can't bend my joints.

305
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I can't bend it like this.

306
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I can't bend it like this.

307
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Why?

308
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Why?

309
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I'm a doll.

310
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
What?

311
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Do it properly.

312
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Well...

313
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
But seriously, let's do it together.

314
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Let's do it together.

315
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Let's do it together.

316
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
But it's not fun if we do it together.

317
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
It's fun to do it alone.

318
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I'll do it with animals.

319
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
No!

320
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I'll do it with a lot of animals.

321
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Don't be noisy.

322
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
It's not scary.

323
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I'll do it with a hand.

324
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Yes.

325
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
It's still a little better.

326
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
It's still a little better.

327
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I'll do it with animals.

328
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
In the end, we'll all be dumb.

329
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
We'll all wear pianos.

330
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
We'll all be like this.

331
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
You'll be the only one who can do it.

332
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
The difficulty isn't the highest.

333
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
It's just a little bit.

334
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
It's just a little bit.

335
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
It's like a beginner class.

336
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
It's just a little bit.

337
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Let's do it like that.

338
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
So, let's start with one person.

339
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Yeah.

340
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Let's start with one person.

341
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Yeah.

342
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
It's Suga or Saito.

343
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
So, sorry.

344
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I said Suga or Saito.

345
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
All the staff will be 9 o'clock.

346
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Right?

347
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Yeah.

348
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
The staff will be 9 o'clock.

349
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
It doesn't matter if you're wrong.

350
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
That's right.

351
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Right?

352
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,000
The sound engineer, lighting engineer, the artist, the cameraman, and Tokyo.

353
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Everyone will be 9 o'clock.

354
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Everyone.

355
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Make-up artists and stylists.

356
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,000
If you're wrong, the crane will give you a sponge.

357
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
It's not a trial.

358
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
It's not a trial.

359
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
If you're wrong, I'll be waiting for you downstairs.

360
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I'll put a lot of forks in the ground.

361
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Hey!

362
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I'll be waiting for you when you go.

363
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
That's right.

364
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
That's right.

365
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
So, it's decided.

366
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Yeah.

367
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
It's decided.

368
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
So, which one will win?

369
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I bet that there will be an all-star this year.

370
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
That's wrong!

371
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
There won't be!

372
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Definitely!

373
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Well, this is the first place.

374
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Yes, yes.

375
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
It's not certain that all of them will come out, but...

376
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,000
At first, these people will come out, and then the others will come in.

377
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I got it.

378
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
So, which one will come out?

379
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
If I'm wrong...

380
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Paris!

381
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Paris!

382
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Paris!

383
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
It's my turn.

384
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Huh?

385
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
It's my turn.

386
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Paris!

387
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
It's my turn.

388
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
It's my turn.

389
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
It's my turn.

390
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Paris!

391
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Paris!

392
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Now, it's your turn.

393
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Definitely!

394
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
It's the first match!

395
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Huh?

396
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
It's the first match!

397
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Huh?

398
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
What?

399
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
At the end of the first match...

400
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
At the end of the first match...

401
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
At the end of the first match...

402
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Why?

403
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Why didn't you show it to me earlier?

404
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
While listening to the radio.

405
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Ah, I lost!

406
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Why are you holding the ribbon?

407
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
That's right.

408
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I'll do it too.

409
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
You do it too.

410
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
The moment I know I lost, I'll jump down.

411
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
When is this?

412
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Paris...

413
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Huh?

414
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
When is the Japan Series?

415
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Japan Series?

416
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
It's the All-Star!

417
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
You don't know anything!

418
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
When is the Japan Series?

419
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
It's the All-Star!

420
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
When is the Japan Series?

421
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
When is the All-Star?

422
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
July 24th.

423
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
July 24th.

424
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
It's soon.

425
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
It's already decided by the time of this broadcast.

426
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Really?

427
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
That's right.

428
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
It's already decided by the time of this broadcast.

429
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
If that's the case...

430
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
If that's the case...

431
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
If that's the case...

432
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
If that's the case...

433
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
If that's the case...

434
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Alright, the postcards!

435
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Alright.

436
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I don't like this.

437
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I think I'll quit.

438
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I have to introduce her.

439
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I have to introduce her.

440
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I'm a bit late, but...

441
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
This person is...

442
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I think I'll quit this program.

443
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
It's a rare name.

444
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
It's Chunko Chinonene.

445
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
She lives at Itabashi, Tokyo.

446
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Are you siblings?

447
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
How old are you?

448
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Who's your big sister?

449
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Hamada is my big sister.

450
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
You...

451
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Thank you.

452
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Which one is prettier, you or your sister?

453
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:46,500
I see.

454
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,000
Thank you very much.

455
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Thank you very much.

456
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
A college student.

457
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:55,000
When you went to a hotel with your girlfriend during your high school days, I heard that there was a fire at that hotel.

458
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Is that true?

459
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
If it's true, please tell us more about it.

460
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Please tell us more about it.

461
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
This was the first time...

462
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
It was the first time when I had a crush on someone.

463
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
There was a fire.

464
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
There was a fire.

465
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,000
On New Year's Day, I went to a hotel at Umeda.

466
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
The name of the hotel was Diamond.

467
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Don't say the name.

468
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:21,000
The inside of the hotel was very dirty.

469
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
When I went in, the stand was exposed.

470
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
There was no umbrella.

471
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,000
At first, it was strange that the stand had an umbrella.

472
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,000
But when I went in, the light bulb came out.

473
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I thought I was going to faint, so I took a shower.

474
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
But the light bulb was shining, right?

475
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
That's right.

476
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Because it was only the light bulb.

477
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
That's right.

478
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I hugged her with my strong arms.

479
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I hugged her and said, come here.

480
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Who is acting like that?

481
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
It's just a story.

482
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I'm sure the girl was ready.

483
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I know. I know.

484
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I know. I know.

485
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I know. I know.

486
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I know.

487
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
It was a funny story.

488
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I know.

489
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Stop it.

490
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I know.

491
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
It's a story.

492
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Don't talk too much.

493
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I know.

494
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I know.

495
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I understand.

496
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I know.

497
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I understand.

498
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
You are so funny.

499
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I know.

500
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I know.

501
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I know.

502
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Let's go!

503
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
You're the one who said it

504
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
No...

505
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
That's why...

506
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
This is the first kiss I've seen with my parents

507
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
No...

508
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
What are you talking about?

509
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Don't look at me

510
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Don't look at me

511
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Aren't you an idiot?

512
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I'm going to...

513
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Don't talk nonsense!

514
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
We're going to be naked

515
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Women are going to take off their clothes

516
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Don't talk like that

517
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I'm going to take off my clothes

518
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Why are you taking off your clothes?

519
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
You're sweating

520
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
This is how you take off your clothes

521
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
This is how you take off your clothes

522
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
It's very hard

523
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
It's very hard

524
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
It's a very hard way

525
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
It's a very hard way

526
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
This is very funny

527
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I'm laughing but I can take it off more

528
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
That's enough

529
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I'm going to take out the mannequin from my bag

530
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
It's not good if it breaks

531
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I'm going to do it

532
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
You're going to do it

533
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
The girl is not talking

534
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I'm going to do it

535
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I'm definitely going to do it

536
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
The girl is gone

537
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
The girl is gone

538
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
The mannequin is gone again

539
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I'm done

540
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I'm done

541
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
You're going to fall

542
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Then

543
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Then

544
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
The girl is going to say

545
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
She's embarrassed

546
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
That's right

547
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Even if she says it

548
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
She's happy

549
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
She's happy

550
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
She's going to say she doesn't want to do it

551
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I convinced her

552
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
As much as I can

553
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I like it when it's bright

554
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I like it when it's bright

555
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I like it when it's bright

556
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
I like it when it's bright

557
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I convinced her

558
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
With my strawberry talk

559
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
It's a sweet and sour talk

560
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I see

561
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Even so, the girl still doesn't like it

562
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Right?

563
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I couldn't help it

564
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,000
So I put on a new YG shirt

565
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I put it on the mannequin

566
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
The YG of Gunse

567
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
I put it on the mannequin

568
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
It's just the right size

569
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
I see

570
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I said, if I do this, I can leave it to you

571
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Right?

572
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
So I said, okay, I got it

573
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
That's how our relationship started

574
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Then, after a while

575
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
The girl started crying

576
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
I thought you had something good

577
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
I thought I had something good

578
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
I've never seen a girl cry this much

579
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Right?

580
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
It's not like that

581
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
The girl said her eyes hurt

582
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
When I think about it, I'm crying too

583
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
The two of them are crying

584
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Right?

585
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Their eyes hurt

586
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
When I saw it, the room was full of smoke

587
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
When I stood up, my YG was burning

588
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I opened the window and it was so bright

589
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
The sun was so bright that it could be seen on the bed

590
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
I poured water on it

591
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
I managed to hold it together

592
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
That was my first experience

593
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
What happened after that?

594
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
After that, the two of them burned

595
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
It's been a while since we played a game

596
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
We decided on a punishment game

597
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
You said something great

598
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Now that I think about it

599
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
I'm really scared

600
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I'm really scared

601
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
But I have an idea

602
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
What?

603
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:01,000
When I go up and get pushed down, my body becomes like a ball

604
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
I don't want to go back

605
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I don't want to go back

606
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:10,000
The All-Stars lost the first game

607
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
You go to Paris, I go to Céline

608
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
The one who loses will dive

609
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Right?

610
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Yes

611
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
So that's how it is

612
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
But it's so high

613
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I'm scared

614
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:28,000
This is the first and last punishment game

615
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
I can't do it

616
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
You can't do it

617
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,000
What if the parachute doesn't open?

618
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
You

619
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:40,000
From now on, I'm going to go to the pet shop every day

620
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
I'm going to kiss a lot of my friends

621
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
You're going to ask for help?

622
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
I'm going to get them together

623
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,000
I'm going to jump with two people

624
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I don't want to say it

625
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Then you should stop

626
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:03,000
I have a letter, a question, and an assistant

627
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
I have a lot of letters

628
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Thank you for watching

629
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
See you next week

630
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Thank you for your viewing
