1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
In the first episode of Gaki no Tsukai, Chikichiki!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Yamasaki Hosei's drinking habits thoroughly verified!

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Today is going to be a terrible day.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Oh really?

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
It's been many years since Gaki no Tsukai started.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
To be honest, there have been times when I've slipped, right?

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Well, well, well.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
How do I say this?

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
If you go to an old place, you're a Tsukkomi robot.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Even now...

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Even if you just remember that...

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
There are times when you wake up sweating.

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
But today, I don't think it's going to be like that.

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm not sure about this, but...

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I think it's going to be a terrible 30 minutes.

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Oh really?

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Hasn't it happened before?

18
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
No, it hasn't.

19
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
A few weeks ago, about 3 weeks ago,

20
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Yamasaki had a bad drinking habit.

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
At the end of the show,

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
he invited Kokoriko and the broadcaster Takatsu

23
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
and made them go out for drinks.

24
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
They were secretly recording it.

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
They were doing it like,

26
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
if it's an interesting part, I'll use it.

27
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
When I saw that,

28
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
something amazing happened.

29
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Something amazing happened.

30
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
It's like,

31
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
it's a good idea to start our show like that.

32
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
For the time being, I'd like you to watch this part.

33
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I have to tell you what it's going to be like for the next 30 minutes.

34
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:43,000
It's illegal.

35
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Do you come here often?

36
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I'm sorry, Mr. Takatsu.

37
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
This is the 4th time.

38
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Thank you for your time.

39
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Thank you.

40
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Did you really do it?

41
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
No, not yet.

42
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
But I've been doing it since now.

43
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Did you drink Nakai Konsen?

44
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I drank Nakai Konsen a few weeks ago.

45
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I was wearing Shimarade and Nakai Konsen.

46
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Which one is your favorite?

47
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
My favorite is Kakiri, Nakai Konsen, and X.

48
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
All of them?

49
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Yes.

50
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
But I can't wear it like this anymore.

51
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
At first, it was just Kaki.

52
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
But I think it's getting bigger.

53
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
But I don't know when it's going to die.

54
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
It's definitely going to die.

55
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
This is definitely going to die.

56
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Really?

57
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
This is going to die.

58
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Did something happen?

59
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
No, it's not that it's going to die.

60
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I think it's going to die.

61
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
My stomach is starting to hurt.

62
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Everyone says that it's not going to die.

63
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
My stomach is hurting.

64
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
What is health?

65
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
It's like this.

66
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:10,000
When we wake up in the morning,

67
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
we get really angry.

68
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
What is that?

69
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
That's health.

70
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
What do you think?

71
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I don't think it's going to die.

72
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
It's not going to die.

73
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Yes, it's not going to die.

74
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
If I say that it's not going to die,

75
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I'll probably say,

76
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
please give me 10 million yen.

77
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
If you say that it's not going to die,

78
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
won't you lend me money?

79
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I won't lend it to you.

80
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Really?

81
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I'm not going to lend it to you.

82
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Really?

83
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
What if I ask you?

84
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
If you say that it's not going to die?

85
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
What if I ask you to lend me 10 million yen?

86
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
If you say that it's not going to die?

87
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I won't lend it to you.

88
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Really?

89
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
One shot.

90
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
One shot.

91
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
One shot.

92
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
One shot.

93
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
One shot.

94
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
One shot.

95
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Come on, drink it.

96
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Mr. Takasu, just drink it.

97
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Just drink it.

98
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Excuse me, water.

99
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Yes.

100
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Please give me some water.

101
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Are you going to drink it?

102
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I'm not going to drink it.

103
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I'm drinking spicy food,

104
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
but Mr. Takasu isn't drinking it at all.

105
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I'm drinking it.

106
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I don't care.

107
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I'm not drinking it.

108
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
You're drinking it.

109
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I'm not drinking it.

110
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
It's love.

111
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I'm not going to drink it anymore.

112
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I don't want to drink it anymore.

113
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Yes.

114
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Mr. Takasu, are you finished drinking it?

115
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Yes.

116
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
And certain eindhoven.

117
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Just drink one thing of this, please.

118
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I can't drink it.

119
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Just drink one.

120
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
At this rate,

121
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I can't drink it Stop drinking.

122
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Drink one, at this rate,

123
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I can't drink it with you guys.

124
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
You're the best!

125
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Thank you!

126
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
You're the best!

127
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Yeah!

128
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Thank you!

129
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I'm the best, right?

130
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Yeah.

131
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I'm the best.

132
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
You're the best.

133
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I think you're a little different from the last time.

134
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Why are you always dressed like a girl?

135
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
You're always dressed like a girl.

136
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
It's like a video game.

137
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
It's good.

138
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
It's good.

139
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I don't like you guys trying to eat me up.

140
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
What are you talking about?

141
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
What do you mean?

142
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
You guys are trying to eat me up.

143
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
We're not.

144
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
We're not.

145
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I'm not.

146
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I'm not trying to do anything.

147
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
You guys are saying that I'm a bully.

148
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I'm a bully.

149
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I'm a bully.

150
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
You only did the opening for two episodes.

151
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I'm not a bully.

152
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Are you sure?

153
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I'm not a bully.

154
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I'm not a bully.

155
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I'm not a bully.

156
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I'm not a bully.

157
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Go home.

158
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I'm not a bully.

159
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Go home.

160
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I'm not a bully.

161
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Go home.

162
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Go home.

163
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I'm not a bully.

164
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I'm going home.

165
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I'm going home.

166
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I'm going home.

167
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I'm going home.

168
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Sit down.

169
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I've been preparing so much for the two episodes.

170
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
This guy is weird.

171
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I've been preparing so much for the two episodes.

172
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Where are you going?

173
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Where are you going?

174
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I'm not saying anything.

175
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Everyone likes you.

176
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I love you.

177
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Dantan-san too.

178
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Yes.

179
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Shiba-san too.

180
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Yes.

181
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Everyone likes you.

182
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Why do you have to buy today's opening?

183
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Why do you have to buy today's show?

184
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I'm not doing anything.

185
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Everyone says that I'm a bully.

186
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Everyone says that I'm a bully.

187
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Everyone says that I'm a bully.

188
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
You're acting strangely.

189
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I'm acting strangely.

190
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I've been acting strangely lately.

191
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Are you not satisfied?

192
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I'm not satisfied.

193
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Are you not satisfied?

194
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Are you not satisfied?

195
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I'm not satisfied.

196
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Are you not satisfied with the show?

197
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I'm not satisfied with the show.

198
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
What are you not satisfied with?

199
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I want to talk all the time.

200
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
This is over.

201
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Next.

202
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
What are you not satisfied with?

203
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I can't talk.

204
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
You can't talk.

205
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Why do you have the right to say that?

206
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
You can't talk.

207
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
It's you.

208
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Do you want to talk?

209
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I want to talk.

210
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I'm a kid.

211
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
If you don't have a number, how many numbers can you get?

212
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I have a number.

213
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Do you have a number?

214
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I have a number.

215
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I have a number.

216
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I have a number.

217
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
If you don't have a number, you can't go home.

218
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
What are you doing?

219
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
If you don't have a number, you can't go home.

220
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Do you have a number?

221
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I have a number.

222
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I'm not sure about that.

223
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
If I talk, I'll get over 20%.

224
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
What if you don't get it?

225
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I can't think of not getting it.

226
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Do you mean you'll get over 20%?

227
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I'll get it.

228
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Can you really get it?

229
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Really?

230
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
You're an idiot.

231
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Really?

232
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
How many years do you think I've been doing this?

233
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Go home.

234
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I'll go home.

235
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Go home.

236
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Go home.

237
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I don't want to go home.

238
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Let's go.

239
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I'll go home.

240
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I'll take you home.

241
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I'll take you home.

242
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Go home.

243
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Let's go.

244
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Let's go.

245
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Why did you throw it?

246
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
It's like this.

247
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,000
He said he wants to do it instead of us. If I do it, I can get 20%.

248
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
He has given up.

249
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I'm sorry to the winner.

250
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I don't have any extravagance.

251
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Let's call him.

252
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Here he is. The funny comedian.

253
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
The funny comedian of the century.

254
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Here he is.

255
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Here he is.

256
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
He is very excited.

257
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Here he is.

258
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
This will be the opening, right?

259
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Yes.

260
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
After this, we will go out.

261
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Yes.

262
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
What will you do?

263
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Yamasaki will do it.

264
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I've thought about it.

265
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I think you should do it.

266
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
You said it.

267
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I've thought about it.

268
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I woke up today and I was worried.

269
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I thought I'd run away.

270
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
There is a TV station in Izumi.

271
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
But I came.

272
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
You came.

273
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
You have a sense of responsibility.

274
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I have a sense of responsibility.

275
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
It's amazing that I can do this.

276
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
If I do it, I can get 20%.

277
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I'll leave the talk to you.

278
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Tell me one thing.

279
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
How should I do it?

280
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
It's a big question.

281
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Just tell me what you think.

282
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
It's funny.

283
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
It's funny.

284
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I've never thought about it.

285
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,000
This program is brought to you by these sponsors.

286
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I'm going to do what I usually do.

287
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Stop it.

288
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Stop it.

289
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Are you okay?

290
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
No.

291
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Are you okay?

292
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Are you okay?

293
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Are you okay?

294
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
No.

295
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
It's about to start.

296
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
It's about to start.

297
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
It's about to start.

298
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
No.

299
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Stop it.

300
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Wait a minute.

301
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I'm waiting.

302
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
You said you were confident.

303
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
You said it yourself.

304
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
No.

305
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I don't like it.

306
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I don't like it.

307
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Are you still sleeping?

308
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Yes.

309
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Are you going to run away again?

310
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I'm going to run away.

311
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Let's do it.

312
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I don't care.

313
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Let's do it.

314
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Yes, please.

315
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I'm going.

316
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Excuse me.

317
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Excuse me.

318
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Excuse me.

319
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Are you okay?

320
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
What?

321
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Are you okay?

322
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I'm not okay.

323
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Are you okay?

324
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Are you okay?

325
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Ladies and gentlemen.

326
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:49,000
There he is! There he is! The funny comedian of the end of the century!

327
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Good evening. Today, I'd like everyone to touch my charm even just a little bit.

328
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Now, let's do our best together!

329
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,000
It's about... It's about an hour and a half!

330
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:11,000
One hour and a half! I'm going to talk for an hour and a half!

331
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I'm going to make you all fall into my trap!

332
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Now, let's get started.

333
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Recently, I've been...

334
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Recently, I've been...

335
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Um... Wait a minute.

336
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Um... Wait a minute.

337
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I don't know what I was trying to say.

338
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Recently, I've been really angry.

339
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Um... I don't know how everyone is doing these days, but I've been really angry.

340
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I've been really angry.

341
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I'm sorry, but I've lost all of my energy.

342
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I'm sorry, but I've lost all of my energy.

343
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
What do I do? What do I do?

344
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
What do I do? What do I do?

345
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
What are you doing?

346
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I'm sorry, but I've lost all of my energy.

347
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Your face is really stiff, and the audience has noticed how stiff your face is.

348
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
The audience is nervous, too.

349
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Oh, really?

350
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
This is the worst.

351
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
That's right.

352
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Thank you.

353
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Your face is even scarier now.

354
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Your face is even scarier now.

355
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I think it was better the way it was before.

356
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Let's do our best today.

357
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Today, I'm going to make you laugh with my stand-up comedy.

358
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Let's go up.

359
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Today, I've been really angry.

360
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I've been really angry.

361
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I have a weak body, so I get sick easily.

362
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Once, I did something called the colon fiber.

363
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Do you know what that is?

364
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
The colon fiber is really painful.

365
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I looked at my stomach, and my stomach started to hurt.

366
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:43,000
My stomach started to hurt, and I didn't know why, so I did the colon fiber.

367
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
The colon fiber is really painful.

368
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I put a cord like this in my butt.

369
00:16:52,000 --> 00:17:03,000
But the cord doesn't go in as it is, so I put air in it and put the cord in.

370
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
It hurts so much.

371
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,000
It's okay if it hurts, but it's really embarrassing.

372
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I put air in it, and the air comes out.

373
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I thought it was really embarrassing.

374
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,000
There are a lot of things that make me angry.

375
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
When I go to Roppongi, I get angry.

376
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
When I go to Roppongi, I get angry.

377
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:45,000
There was a foreigner, a black man, who was really scary.

378
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:51,000
The black man was really scary, so he said,

379
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
You idiot!

380
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I don't know if you're scary or not.

381
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I had a lot of feelings like that.

382
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I had a lot of feelings like that.

383
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I'm sorry.

384
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:19,000
My mother and father are funny people.

385
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I've changed a little.

386
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
My parents have changed.

387
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I was in a comedy called Team Zero.

388
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I was in a comedy called Team Zero.

389
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I won the rookie award at the ABC competition.

390
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I was nervous because I didn't think I'd get it.

391
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I was nervous because I didn't think I'd get it.

392
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:46,000
The best rookie award at the ABC competition is...

393
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:52,000
The best rookie award is Team Zero!

394
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
My father stood up and said,

395
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:59,000
My father stood up and said,

396
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
He stood up and said,

397
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
You idiot!

398
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
I still don't know what that means.

399
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:10,000
I still don't know what that means.

400
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Now, show me your teeth.

401
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Why?

402
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:30,000
This is a question for Mr. Yamazaki, who has fought various monsters on various shows.

403
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Please tell me how to make it easier for lions.

404
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
I don't know what's going to happen in the 21st century from now on.

405
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I'd like to tell you how to make it easier for lions when they're attacked by lions.

406
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:53,000
There's a lion, right?

407
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
There's a lion, right?

408
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:04,000
There's a lion!

409
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I don't need these teeth.

410
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I've never met a lion before.

411
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Are you stupid?

412
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I'm not stupid.

413
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
For example,

414
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I'm sure you'll be able to laugh no matter what the situation is.

415
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I'm sure you'll be able to laugh no matter what the situation is.

416
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
My girlfriend always asks me to laugh because she thinks it's funny.

417
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
I'm an amateur, so I often slip.

418
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
So, Mr. Yamazaki,

419
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Please imitate something that never slips no matter what the situation is.

420
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
This is good.

421
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
This is the first time I've ever revealed this.

422
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:47,000
I'm sure you'll be able to laugh no matter what the situation is.

423
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
I'm sure you'll be able to laugh no matter what the situation is.

424
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:54,000
First of all, I'll imitate Adachi Yumi.

425
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:03,000
If you're going to show sympathy, give me money!

426
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
That was really...

427
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Are you really stupid?

428
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
I'm sure you'll be able to laugh no matter what the situation is.

429
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Please remember this.

430
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Imitate Hiroko Yakushima.

431
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Eh?

432
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Speed!

433
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Wake me up!

434
00:21:41,000 --> 00:22:05,000
What are you doing?

435
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Do your best!

436
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:20,000
I can't do this anymore.

437
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Now, let's move on to the Q&A section.

438
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:56,000
This is the real deal.

439
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Where did he go?

440
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
He ran away.

441
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
He ran away.

442
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:18,000
You can't go to the bathroom all of a sudden.

443
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
You!

444
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Why are you running away?

445
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Hey!

446
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Hey!

447
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Stop it!

448
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Stop it!

449
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Hey!

450
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Hey!

451
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Hey!

452
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Hey!

453
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Hey!

454
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Hey!

455
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
You scared me!

456
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Why are you running away?

457
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
You scared me!

458
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Why are you running away?

459
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
What's wrong?

460
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
What's wrong?

461
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
I can't do this anymore.

462
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:54,000
I can't do this anymore.

463
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
You're a scary man!

464
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Do you understand?

465
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Are you leaving?

466
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Wait!

467
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Wait!

468
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Ose!

469
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Ose!

470
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Wait!

471
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
No!

472
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Calm down!

473
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
I can't do this anymore!

474
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Calm down!

475
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
I can't do this anymore!

476
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
I can't do this anymore!

477
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
But you have a phone!

478
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Really?

479
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Well, it's a lie.

480
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:33,000
