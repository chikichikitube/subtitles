00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Kotonohottan was in the middle of recording last week's talk

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
There's that thing you open at the bottom of the kitchen, right?

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
There's that thing you put a bowl or something on there

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
The one I used before

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
The one you stick with double-sided tape, you can use four of those

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
But it's like this!

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
It's definitely red!

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
This is life! If it's like this...

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
No, I understand that

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Congratulations! You're going to open it, right?

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
You're going to open it, right?

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
You're going to open it, right?

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
You're going to open it, right?

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Matsumoto, who can't control his anger, began to draw more details at the next meeting

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I wonder if it's like this...

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I think I did four of them

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
And then...

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
It's like this

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
What is this angle?

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Bang!

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
What are you looking for?

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
What's wrong? You're looking for this, right?

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
You're looking for this, right?

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
He decides to look for a solution to the problem

25
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
But his partner, Hamada, doesn't care at all

26
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
How are you going to look for it?

27
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Like this

28
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
You're going to do it, right?

29
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
You're going to do it, right?

30
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
You're going to do it, right?

31
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
You're going to do it, right?

32
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Will the Otamakake family, who have such a mediocre look, really exist in this world?

33
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Matsumoto, with his sharp sense of observation and unrivaled insight, challenges the root of evil that lurks in modern society

34
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Matsumoto, cutting off society, Otamakake's solution

35
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
This program is brought to you by these sponsors

36
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
All of a sudden, Downtown goes to look for Otamakake's solution

37
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Matsumoto-san, isn't it around here?

38
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
There's a hook like this

39
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
It's different

40
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
It's like this

41
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
It's below

42
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Around here

43
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
This is Otamakake's solution

44
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
This is terrible

45
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
This hook is...

46
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
The color is different, but the angle is close to mine

47
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
It's close, isn't it?

48
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
It's not like this

49
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Look at this

50
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
If it's like this

51
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
This is good too

52
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
There's no problem

53
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
It's straight

54
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Let's try this

55
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Let's try this

56
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
What are you doing?

57
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
He decides to experiment with Otamakake's solution

58
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:08,000
The shape of the hook is different, but the angle is close to mine

59
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
What is this?

60
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
It's a useless angle

61
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Let's try

62
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Are you ready?

63
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
We're going to do a commercial here

64
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Let's do it

65
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Let's do it

66
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
He dropped 3

67
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
He dropped 2

68
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
But it can't be helped

69
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
When you're cooking

70
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
The enemy wants to do it well

71
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
You have to do it like this

72
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
You have to do it like this

73
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
You have to do it like this

74
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
You have to do it like this

75
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
This is not the right way

76
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
No

77
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
It can't be helped

78
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
It's good

79
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
You were saying this

80
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Why am I saying this so strongly?

81
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
This is a matter of life and death

82
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
This is a matter of life and death

83
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
This is a matter of life and death

84
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
This is a matter of life and death

85
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
What are you looking at?

86
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I got it

87
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Let's buy this

88
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
No

89
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
This is the real deal

90
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
This is a disaster

91
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
This is a disaster

92
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
This is the real deal

93
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
This is the real deal

94
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Let's go

95
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Where are you going?

96
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I'll show you how scary this hook is

97
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Why is this hook related to human life?

98
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
The car goes to a certain place

99
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Mr. Machan

100
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
We've come this far

101
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Isn't this enough?

102
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Let's do it again

103
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Please watch the shocking video from the back side

104
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I'm not going to do any shocking

105
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I'm just going to fall

106
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Let's do it again

107
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I'm going to fall

108
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I'm going to fall

109
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Why is this so small?

110
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Let's zoom in on this shocking video

111
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
This is what happens when you zoom in

112
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Camera man, shake it

113
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
This is what happens

114
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
There are two idiots

115
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
We've specially brought Jimmy

116
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Why is Jimmy being caught?

117
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
We want you to experience it with your body

118
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
This is the last part of the problem

119
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:40,000
This is the part where we explain the problem in detail

120
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
This is what human life is like

121
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
This is impossible

122
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
This is what human life is like

123
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
We want you to see this

124
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
We've brought two people who don't have numbers

125
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Hey, Mr. Tsuga

126
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I'm a talent

127
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:02,000
If you use a talent with numbers, it will go in a different direction

128
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
This is not a punishment game

129
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I see

130
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
This is an experiment

131
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Let's open it

132
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
You can jump

133
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
What?

134
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Why do you look so happy?

135
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
40 and 33

136
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
41

137
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
41

138
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Let's do it again

139
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Press this button

140
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Let's go

141
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Switch on

142
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
You fell

143
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
You fell from the screen

144
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Hurry up

145
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Hurry up

146
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I saw the camera

147
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I saw the camera

148
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Hey

149
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
You're a talent

150
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Are you ready?

151
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
You have to raise your head like this

152
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
You have to raise your head like this

153
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Look at this

154
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
This is what happens

155
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I wanted to say this for two weeks

156
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Say it in the talk

157
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Everyone missed it

158
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:36,000
The staff are being carried

159
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
They are being carried

160
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
You did it

161
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
After this, there was an unexpected development for Matsumoto

162
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Matsumoto

163
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I found one thing

164
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
What is it?

165
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
This is a new truth

166
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I wanted to surprise you

167
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
This is the same hook that I bought at the store

168
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Yes

169
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Look

170
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
The hook of this angle

171
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
As you said

172
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I put it behind the door

173
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
The hook you are talking about

174
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I put it here

175
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
What?

176
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
You can't put it behind the door

177
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
You have to put it here

178
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
He is saying something good

179
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
You have to put the hook here

180
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I put it here

181
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
It's like an old NINJA bath

182
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
It's like an old NINJA bath

183
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Wait

184
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
The maker told Matsumoto

185
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
The hook is wrong

186
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
So I have to put it here

187
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Why?

188
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,000
If you have any questions, please ask

189
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
We will solve it

190
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
What is it?

191
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
There is a parking lot at KO Plaza Hotel

192
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I can't park my car there

193
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I see

194
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I don't know how far I can park my car

195
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I thought it was already parked

196
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
When I parked my car, I went to the wall

197
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Let's go to see KO Plaza

198
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
There are a lot of people

199
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
There are a lot of people, why is it so noisy?

200
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
It's scary

201
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
It's not a very interesting day

202
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
We are so stupid

203
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
We can't do it today

204
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
We are so stupid

205
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
What are you saying?

206
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
It's that...

207
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Gakimizu

208
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
It's selling

209
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
It seems to be selling

210
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
It's just like my strategy

211
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
There is a sense of fear in people

212
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:33,000
It's selling, so I can't keep doing it

213
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
It's not good?

214
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
It's not good, but it's not funny

215
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
It's like a cold coat

216
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
No, that's...

217
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I have one or two

218
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I failed

219
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
You have it

220
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I have it

221
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
What is this?

222
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
It's like a cold coat

223
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I have it

224
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Does it have anything to do with me?

225
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
You are really...

226
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
You are really, really, really, really

227
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
You are really stupid

228
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I can't say it

229
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
You are really stupid

230
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
You like it that much?

231
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
What?

232
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Money

233
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Why?

234
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
You really like it

235
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
You are stupid

236
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:35,000
If there is a 500 yen coin in a high place, you will climb it

237
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
It's hard to find it

238
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
If there is a 500 yen coin in a high place

239
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
If you are in a high place, you will climb it

240
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I don't like high places

241
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
If you have money, you will do something

242
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
You will definitely do it

243
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I said it in the opening

244
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
KO Plaza

245
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Why did you go there?

246
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Why did you go there?

247
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Why did you go there?

248
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
A meeting

249
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
What is that?

250
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
What is a meeting?

251
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
It's like a meeting

252
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Why did you have to go to a meeting?

253
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
What is that?

254
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
A reunion in middle school

255
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
What about me?

256
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Why did you call me?

257
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
No, no, no, Hamada

258
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Yuwasu?

259
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I didn't come, I didn't get a call

260
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Yukkira

261
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:44,000
It's been a long time since we had a reunion

262
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I can't go

263
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Even if it's a reunion

264
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
It's been a long time

265
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Let's meet once in a while

266
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Why are you laughing?

267
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Why are you talking about that reunion?

268
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
It's been a long time

269
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
It's my story

270
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I can see it

271
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I can see it

272
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
If you go there

273
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
The parking lot there is definitely strange

274
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
It's wide

275
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
When cars bump into each other

276
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
There's a parking lot

277
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
That's right

278
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
It's like this

279
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
It's like this

280
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Everyone is there

281
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
The wall is open

282
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
On the wall

283
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
It's like this

284
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Wait, wait

285
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Are you looking at Keio Plaza?

286
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Say Jonathan

287
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Say Jonathan

288
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Say Jonathan

289
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I want him the most

290
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
So

291
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Do you think you can go like this?

292
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Do you think you can go like this?

293
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
You're bumping into the wall

294
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
There's no parking lot

295
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
So this is

296
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
My car's rear is hurt

297
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
It can't be helped

298
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
It's a driving mistake

299
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Eh?

300
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Macchan's driving mistake

301
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
You're making me angry

302
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
But it's a driving mistake

303
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
This is strange

304
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
You have to check it

305
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Normally it's narrow and dark

306
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
It's narrow and dark

307
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
You can open the door and go back like this

308
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Eh?

309
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
You can open the door and go back like this

310
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
You can open the door and look down

311
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Isn't it scary?

312
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
So you go like this

313
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
There's a wall, right?

314
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
You go like this

315
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
This is

316
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
It's really strange

317
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
This is

318
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
That's Keio Plaza's fault

319
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I'm amazing

320
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
That was interesting

321
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Thank you, Ketsu

322
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
This is Ketsu's fault

323
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Matsumoto-san is 84cm, 58cm, 85cm

324
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
It's a nice proportion

325
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
What's the secret of your beauty?

326
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Do you know what my office is?

327
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I'm a yellow cab

328
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
It's a huge army

329
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I am

330
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Yellow cab?

331
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Yellow cab

332
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I'm a yellow cab

333
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
But you don't look at swimsuits

334
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
That's because I'm 32

335
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I'm getting old

336
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I used to be amazing

337
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I was popular around here

338
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I was popular with everyone around here

339
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
It's interesting

340
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I wonder if you know

341
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
What's that?

342
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I'm getting old

343
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Did you put silicone?

344
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
No, I'm getting old

345
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I'm getting old

346
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I'm getting old

347
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I was Bokkon

348
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Bokkon Musume

349
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,000
It was a catch copy

350
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I'm not good at it

351
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
You're not good at it

352
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
There's nothing

353
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
No

354
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Let me tell you

355
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I was Bokkon

356
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
From that time, my tongue was Bokkon

357
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
It was dented

358
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I don't know if it's in

359
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
But it was dented

360
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
That's gross

361
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,000
So my Bokkon is like this

362
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I understand

363
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Bokkon Musume from the land of the stars

364
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Why are you adding it?

365
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
You should've said it from the start

366
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
That's fine

367
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I don't want to talk about this

368
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
84, 58, 85

369
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I think this is my proportion

370
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Why do you think it's 84?

371
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,000
This is my point

372
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
From the time of Kokutai

373
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Kokutai?

374
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I bought it

375
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Kokutai?

376
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Yes

377
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Why did you buy it?

378
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
80, 58, 85

379
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
My opponent is 83, 50

380
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
What number is that?

381
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
What is your opponent doing?

382
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
This is the final point

383
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I understand

384
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
What did you do?

385
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
So I bought it

386
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I decided to buy it

387
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
What?

388
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
So

389
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
No

390
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Give me the paper

391
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Why?

392
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I decided to buy it so it's 85

393
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
You decided to buy it so what did you do?

394
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
So I bought it

395
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
You bought it

396
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I bought it in a three set match

397
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Three set match?

398
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I bought it

399
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
So what kind of match is this?

400
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
What kind of match is this?

401
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
What did you do to get 85?

402
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
That's not a problem right now

403
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I bought it

404
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
It has nothing to do with me getting it

405
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I played a cross game

406
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
You played an ACI

407
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
That's right

408
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
So what did you do?

409
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
In the end, it came up to here

410
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I managed to get it

411
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
You did it on purpose

412
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I was in the middle and he was in the middle

413
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
So it was a competition

414
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I was in the middle and he was in the middle

415
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
That's why I bought it

416
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Why did you get it?

417
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
That's a strange story

418
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:09,000
You can't get 85

419
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
You don't know anything about sports

420
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
If you get it, it's a minus point

421
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I'm telling you to tell me

422
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
What is it?

423
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Are you running?

424
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I'm not running

425
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
If I run, I lose

426
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
If I run, I'm out

427
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Out?

428
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I'm out

429
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Where do you do it?

430
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
What do you mean?

431
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Where is the bus?

432
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Pool

433
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Pool side

434
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
You're telling me a big story

435
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Do you do it on the edge like this?

436
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
You can't run

437
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
It's on the pool side

438
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
You'll get in trouble

439
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
You'll get in trouble

440
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
You can't run

441
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
You can't take it off

442
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
You can't take it off

443
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,000
So you don't know

444
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Is that okay?

445
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
In the end, I...

446
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
That's enough

447
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Give it to me

448
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,000
In the end, I won with 84, 58, 85

449
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I knew that

450
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
It was a tie

451
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Why are you praising me for that?

452
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
It's not like that

453
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,000
My memories from when I was 29

454
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Why are you trying to make it sepia-colored?

455
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I don't know

456
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
I didn't mean it like that

457
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I just wanted to congratulate you

458
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
So tell me how you won

459
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,000
You should have told me earlier

460
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
No, no

461
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
You should have told me

462
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
You should have told me earlier

463
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
What did you say?

464
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
I wanted you to say that

465
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
You changed your mind

466
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
When you were in your early 20s

467
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:00,000
You were an AD for a TV station in Osaka

468
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Yes

469
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Even now, there's a legendary trick

470
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Please show us that trick

471
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
What kind of trick was it?

472
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
It was ad-lib-land

473
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Everyday?

474
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Yes, everyday

475
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Everyday?

476
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
You only did it everyday

477
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
It was everyday

478
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
What?

479
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
I was told to do it everyday

480
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
You should have told my AD

481
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
I can't do it now

482
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
I don't know why

483
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
You do know

484
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
I don't have the courage to do it

485
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
With that?

486
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Yes

487
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Do you want to try it?

488
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
A normal AD

489
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I can't do it

490
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
4, 3, 2, 9

491
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
I don't know where to start

492
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
You should have said 9

493
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
9

494
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
4, 3, 2

495
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
No, no

496
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
It's hard to understand

497
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
No, no

498
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
It's annoying

499
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Why?

500
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Why?

501
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I can't do it

502
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
You look angry

503
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
No, no

504
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I was like this

505
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
I can't move right away

506
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Your hands are like this

507
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Like this

508
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
I can move right away

509
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
I can't move

510
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Why?

511
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
My legs

512
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Why?

513
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
I can't move

514
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
You should have said

515
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
What?

516
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
You should have said

517
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
You're slow

518
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Why do you have to do it everyday?

519
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
You can do it from here

520
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
I can't move

521
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
I can't do it

522
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Why?

523
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Like this

524
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
When did you do that?

525
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:56,000
When I was watching the show

526
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Applause

527
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,000
I don't know how to do it

528
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
It's hard to understand

529
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
You do it like this

530
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
It's weird

531
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
You don't know how to do it

532
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
No, no

533
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
You do it like this

534
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
I can't do it

535
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
I can't do it

536
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Why?

537
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
That's why

538
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
I do it like this

539
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I do it on my own

540
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
You should have said 3

541
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
It's an illusion

542
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
I forgot

543
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:38,000
I should have forgotten

544
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Like this

545
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Can I do it?

546
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
My legs can't move

547
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
You should have said 3

548
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
I don't know how to do it

549
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
My legs can't move

550
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Like this

551
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
5 seconds

552
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
4

553
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,000
3

554
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:04,000
2

555
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
1

556
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Go

557
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
I'm coming

558
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
I'm coming

559
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
I can't do it

560
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:21,000
I can't do it

561
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:28,000
I can't do it
