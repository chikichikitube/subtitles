1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The first time, I was in the middle of cleaning the kids' toilet.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I was like, my body doesn't like this, auntie!

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I'm not in a good mood!

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Dun dun dun dun!

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
What is this?

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
What?

7
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Your body doesn't like this, auntie?

8
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Apparently, I'm going to run around the shopping district with this.

9
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I'm embarrassed.

10
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
With the money I got from this, I'm paying for electricity bills and phone bills.

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
You're paying for it, right?

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I'm eating.

13
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
You're eating, right?

14
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I'm already sending it to the city.

15
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
You ran away.

16
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
You're really fast.

17
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
You ran away.

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I know you don't like it.

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I'll chase after you.

20
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
When you lose sight of me, use this transceiver.

21
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Like this.

22
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I don't want to lose it.

23
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I don't want to get caught.

24
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I have this.

25
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I don't care if you go somewhere I don't know.

26
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I see.

27
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Then, please go.

28
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
If you think it's about time, come to me.

29
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Then, please go.

30
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
No!

31
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
What are you doing?

32
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,000
This is really cool.

33
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
One more thing.

34
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
When you wore auntie's clothes, didn't any of my friends come?

35
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
They went over there.

36
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Where did they go?

37
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
What?

38
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Where did they go?

39
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Where did they go?

40
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Idiot.

41
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Where are you now?

42
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm here.

43
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm here.

44
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Idiot.

45
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I don't care.

46
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Where did they go?

47
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Idiot!

48
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
This program is brought to you by Sunluck.

49
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Ooyama International Products.

50
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
This program is brought to you by these sponsors.

51
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
They're coming.

52
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
They're coming.

53
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
They're coming.

54
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
They're coming.

55
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
They're coming.

56
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
They're coming.

57
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
They're coming.

58
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
They're coming.

59
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
They're coming.

60
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
They're coming.

61
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Where are you now?

62
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I'm here.

63
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:52,000
What?

64
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Where did they go?

65
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
They went over there, didn't they?

66
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Idiot.

67
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Mom, where did the guys in strange clothes go?

68
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Hurry up.

69
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Hurry up.

70
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:28,000
He's fast.

71
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Idiot.

72
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Idiot.

73
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Idiot.

74
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Idiot.

75
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Idiot.

76
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Idiot.

77
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Idiot.

78
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Idiot.

79
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Stop.

80
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
No.

81
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Stop.

82
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
No.

83
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
How much are you paying?

84
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Why would I pay?

85
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Come out.

86
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
No.

87
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Come down.

88
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Idiot.

89
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
They're coming.

90
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Can I wear a mask?

91
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Huh?

92
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Ah!

93
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I don't like this!

94
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Wait!

95
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Wait!

96
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Wait!

97
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
What is this?

98
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Are you in the shopping district?

99
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
No.

100
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
No.

101
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I don't want to say it.

102
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
He's coming!

103
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
He's running!

104
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Run! Run! Let's do this!

105
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Ah!

106
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Ah!

107
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
What?

108
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Well, it always ends with the first time.

109
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I don't want to do it twice.

110
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Anyway, the old lady ran away.

111
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:58,000
That's what I said.

112
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Ladies and gentlemen.

113
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I don't think it has anything to do with the people watching TV.

114
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
What is it?

115
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I don't know.

116
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
It's unusual to be so energetic.

117
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
It's really unusual.

118
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I think the people who watched the opening today will understand.

119
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I'm tired.

120
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I ran around.

121
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I ran around the shopping district.

122
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
In front of the station.

123
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I only slept for about an hour.

124
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I'm exhausted.

125
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
When I woke up in the morning, I was irritated by the low-blood guy.

126
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
He dressed up like an old lady and said,

127
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
No! I don't want to do it!

128
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I ran around the shopping district.

129
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
It's a shopping district.

130
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I was irritated.

131
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
We were having a meeting in Shin-Osaka.

132
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I went in and sat down.

133
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I was irritated.

134
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I was so angry.

135
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I was so irritated when I was knocked down by a trench.

136
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I ordered iced coffee.

137
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
He said,

138
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Yes, it's a katsu-toji set meal.

139
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
It's not a joke.

140
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Don't make such a mistake.

141
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:18,000
What's the difference between iced coffee and katsu-toji?

142
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
That's a lie.

143
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I can't believe it.

144
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
When I asked him,

145
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
He said,

146
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
It's an art car.

147
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
He asked me what I ordered.

148
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
What did you order?

149
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I ordered iced coffee.

150
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
It's a katsu-toji set meal.

151
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I told you.

152
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
It's a katsu-toji set meal.

153
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I was so angry.

154
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I told you it's a katsu-toji set meal.

155
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I was so angry.

156
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I was so angry.

157
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I ordered iced coffee.

158
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I ordered iced coffee.

159
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I was in a bad mood in the morning.

160
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I was in a bad mood in the afternoon.

161
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I shouldn't have been angry.

162
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
You regret it later.

163
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Can't you get up?

164
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I can't get up.

165
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I turn on the volume of the stereo.

166
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
So that it makes a sound when it's time.

167
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I can get up right away.

168
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I can't get up.

169
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
But when I'm really sleepy, I can't get up.

170
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I sleep like this to match the stereo.

171
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
And then I'm really sleepy.

172
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I can't get up.

173
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I was thinking about that the other day.

174
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
What is this?

175
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I'm sure everyone has it.

176
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
There are times when you get a tingle.

177
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
What is that?

178
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
What?

179
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I'm sleeping.

180
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I feel like I'm pulled by a small hand.

181
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
You have it.

182
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
What is that?

183
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
You just fold your hands.

184
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Just fold your hands.

185
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Yes, yes.

186
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Especially around here.

187
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
What is that?

188
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
It's like being pulled by a small hand, something like this.

189
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Something like this?

190
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Something small like this.

191
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Yes, yes, yes.

192
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Something like this.

193
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Ah, what is that?

194
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Is there such a thing?

195
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
What?

196
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
There is, isn't there?

197
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Yes, there is.

198
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
What kind of thing is there?

199
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
The face is normal.

200
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
The face is also normal.

201
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Yes, yes, what is it?

202
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
What is it?

203
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Tell me.

204
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
What is that?

205
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
What is it?

206
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
What is it?

207
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I also have something like this.

208
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
What is it?

209
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
What is this?

210
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
What is this?

211
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
When I was in elementary school, it was the first time I had this.

212
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
It was really uncomfortable.

213
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Ah, you were sick.

214
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I also have a butt.

215
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I don't have a butt.

216
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I don't have a butt.

217
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
What?

218
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Where is the butt?

219
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
This hard part.

220
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
If it is like this, it will be like this.

221
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
It's annoying.

222
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
It makes me angry.

223
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
If it is like this, I will hit it.

224
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I can't take it anymore.

225
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I feel good about my body.

226
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I can't take it anymore.

227
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
But it still makes a sound.

228
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
In the morning, when I'm in a hurry, my butt makes a sound.

229
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
It's really annoying.

230
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I have never been in such a situation.

231
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Even if you say it's annoying.

232
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
When my face makes a sound, I want to look in the mirror.

233
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Is it really moving?

234
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Yes, yes, yes.

235
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I don't think it's moving by itself.

236
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I was driving my car.

237
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
What about here?

238
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
In front of me.

239
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
When I actually saw it, it was moving.

240
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
It's not moving.

241
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
In the morning, when I'm busy, I forget my watch.

242
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I melt my head.

243
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:51,000
In the morning, when my jacket is cold, it makes a sound.

244
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
It's dangerous.

245
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
You should hide.

246
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Why?

247
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Is there something?

248
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
No, no, no.

249
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Really.

250
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
It's really annoying.

251
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
My body is really strange.

252
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
There is, but it's not that good.

253
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I want to solve that strange thing.

254
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
And the hair I was talking about.

255
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
What?

256
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Who is the hair?

257
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
What?

258
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
It's annoying.

259
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Why?

260
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
The hair grows.

261
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I think it's annoying.

262
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
When I wake up tomorrow.

263
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Yes, yes, yes.

264
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I'm going to cut my hair.

265
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
When I think about it, the next day.

266
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
When you set your hair in the morning.

267
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I set my hair.

268
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
It's pretty good.

269
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
It's pretty good.

270
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I can't say it's bad.

271
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
After two or three days.

272
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I'm going to cut my hair.

273
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
The hair is alive.

274
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
One by one.

275
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Do you understand?

276
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
It's alive.

277
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I don't want to be cut by my hair.

278
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I don't want to be cut.

279
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I want to fold it as long as I can.

280
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I want to fold it.

281
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I don't want to cut it.

282
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
When I say I'm going to cut it short.

283
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
My hair will go like this.

284
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Please listen to me.

285
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Then.

286
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Your hair is going to be cut short.

287
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
And theそa is going to command you to roll up your sleeves.

288
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Please listen to us.

289
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I didn't wanna be cut by my hair today.

290
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Listen to me.

291
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I'm going to be cut by my hair tomorrow.

292
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I'm going to be cut by my hair tomorrow.

293
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Don't be arrogant.

294
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
The白es over there.

295
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I can't help you tomorrow.

296
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Eda-kun, calm down!

297
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Yes!

298
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
If you have a hangover, go to sleep!

299
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Don't be like that!

300
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Do you understand?

301
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Yes!

302
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
And the next day, if you go to the public bath, it's clean!

303
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
What?

304
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
You're saying something good!

305
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
If you say it's okay not to wear it!

306
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Yes!

307
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Everyone, good job!

308
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Good job!

309
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I'll break it!

310
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I don't know about this guy!

311
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I see!

312
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
But in the end, you'll be cut!

313
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Yes, yes, yes!

314
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
At times like that, it can't be helped!

315
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
At times like that, it can't be helped!

316
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Say goodbye!

317
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Yes, yes, yes!

318
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Say thank you!

319
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I think there's definitely something like that!

320
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
The human body is mysterious!

321
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Also, when you drink something hot, after you drink it,

322
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:36,000
it's the same with anything, even cold things!

323
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
After you drink it, you go like this, right?

324
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Why is that?

325
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Or after you've shaved your beard, you go like this!

326
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Yes, yes, yes!

327
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Bup!

328
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Ah!

329
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Um...

330
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Um...

331
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Ah...

332
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Um...

333
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Ah...

334
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
What's that?

335
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Well, if you're a soldier, you'll understand!

336
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Even if you're a soldier, you'll just go like this!

337
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Ah, I did it!

338
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I understand that!

339
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
You'll say, I did it!

340
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I understand that!

341
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
But if you drink something hot, after you drink it,

342
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Ah...

343
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
What's that ah?

344
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I don't need it!

345
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
But if you're told not to say it, it's hard to drink!

346
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
After you drink something hot, after you drink it,

347
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Ah...

348
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,000
It's because you say it!

349
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
That's why you have a big face!

350
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I remember when I was in middle school,

351
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I think it was a year ago,

352
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I had a fight with my dad.

353
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I was tired from sleeping in the kotatsu,

354
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
And my dad brought me a sweet sake!

355
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
He brought me a sweet sake, and I was sleeping next to him!

356
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000
In the kotatsu, he brought me a sweet sake, and while I was drinking it,

357
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Ah...

358
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Ah...

359
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
What's that?

360
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Ah, I was so angry!

361
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Ah...

362
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I was so angry!

363
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Dad, you were drinking sweet sake!

364
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
You should've said ah!

365
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
You should've said ah!

366
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I thought, when will this end?

367
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
If you drink it all, it'll end!

368
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
If you drink it all, it'll end!

369
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
It's over!

370
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I thought it's over, so I went over there,

371
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
And brought some more!

372
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I didn't drink it all!

373
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I've never even touched it at home.

374
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Ah, don't say that!

375
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
This is Matsumoto family's ah-sign.

376
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
What's that?

377
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Ah-sign?

378
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Please bring me a note.

379
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
What's wrong with you?

380
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Thank you very much.

381
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
It's over?

382
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
It's over.

383
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
It's no use touching it.

384
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
This person is from Tokyo,

385
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Machidashi?

386
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Takahashi-san.

387
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I enjoy watching it every week.

388
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
By the way, on the 20th of February,

389
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
It's about a child's user.

390
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
After I read the note,

391
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
At the end,

392
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
When I saw the note,

393
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
It said,

394
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
A child's user?

395
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
After that,

396
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
It became a simple story.

397
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
That was also interesting,

398
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
But I wanted to hear that child's story,

399
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
So I couldn't sleep at night.

400
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
What does that mean?

401
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
What was I trying to say?

402
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
There were a lot of notes,

403
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
About the end of the child's user.

404
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I wanted to say that.

405
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
The child's user,

406
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
The last episode is about to end.

407
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
There were a lot of notes like that.

408
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I wanted to comment on that,

409
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
But I couldn't think of anything.

410
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
So I said,

411
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Yes, yes, yes.

412
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
This child's user who has been loved by everyone.

413
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
How many years has it been?

414
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Well,

415
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
It's been half a year.

416
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
That's short.

417
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
It's been going on like this.

418
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Well,

419
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
The people who came today are lucky, right?

420
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
It's a small number.

421
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:16,000
It's one of the few remaining numbers.

422
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
What? Are you underestimating me?

423
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
If I say this,

424
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Normally,

425
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
What?

426
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
There should be more children, right?

427
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
What kind of brain do they have?

428
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000
There are a lot of lucky people.

429
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Well,

430
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
There were a lot of notes like that.

431
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I don't know who said that,

432
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
But it's still going on.

433
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,000
At least for now.

434
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
There are a lot of people who get it directly.

435
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
It's supposed to end on March 1st.

436
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Yes, yes, yes.

437
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
This time,

438
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
This feeling has been like this all the time.

439
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
But instead of us,

440
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Daruma Shokudo will do it.

441
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Who is it?

442
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I don't know at all.

443
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Let's go to the next one.

444
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
This person is from Otaku.

445
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Good morning, Machan.

446
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I'm a fan of Hama-chan.

447
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Are you a fan of Hama-chan?

448
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Hama-chan has been getting fat recently.

449
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
That's right.

450
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I wonder if his belly is happy.

451
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
That's right.

452
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
He's getting fat.

453
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I used to be thin.

454
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
At one point,

455
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
He broke his teeth.

456
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
His teeth.

457
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
At that time, he couldn't eat rice.

458
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
At that time, he was quite thin.

459
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
After he broke his teeth,

460
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
He started eating rice again.

461
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I don't know if he's getting fat.

462
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
That's right.

463
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I can't say he's making a lot of money.

464
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:47,000
But I can give you money that you can put in your mouth right away.

465
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I'm a rich man.

466
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I can give you money that you can put in your mouth right away.

467
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I can give you money that you can put in your mouth right away.

468
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
You shouldn't look at your teeth.

469
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Even if you shave your teeth,

470
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
It won't take long.

471
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
That's your money.

472
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Leave me alone.

473
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
You want to give it to someone who is fat.

474
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I broke my teeth during the show.

475
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
That's right.

476
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
What is it?

477
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
If you break your teeth here,

478
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I'll get you out of the child care center.

479
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
That's it.

480
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
That's right.

481
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
If you want to have beautiful teeth,

482
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
You should hit it hard.

483
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
That's right.

484
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
That's right.

485
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
That's it.

486
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
That's right.

487
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I thought it was okay.

488
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I said goodbye.

489
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
I hit it hard.

490
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
It's here.

491
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
It hurts.

492
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
That's not the case.

493
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
You broke your teeth during the show.

494
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
I lost eight of my teeth.

495
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Your fangs are rauslan cuestión.

496
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:56,000
I'll tear you down.

497
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,000
My fangs are all round.

498
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
reverse

499
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I'll bite with better strength.

500
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
That's it.

501
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
What's wrong with you?

502
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
You really like to talk, don't you?

503
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Your head hurts!

504
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Because I ran too much.

505
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
If everyone in my body changed, I'd be surprised.

506
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Why does he have such a painful head?

507
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
He can't even talk.

508
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
He's having a hard time right now.

509
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I'm always like this.

510
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
What do you want me to do today?

511
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Galangu.

512
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Galangu, right?

513
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I'm jealous.

514
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
You can still use it.

515
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Next?

516
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
I'm jealous.

517
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
I'm jealous.

518
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I can still do this.

519
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Next?

520
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Takeda Tetsuya.

521
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Takeda Tetsuya.

522
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Kuruya!

523
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
He's pitiful.

524
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
The one who did it first.

525
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
It's okay.

526
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
What's next?

527
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Ikariya Chosuke.

528
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
What?

529
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Ikariya Chosuke.

530
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
What?

531
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Ikariya Chosuke.

532
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
I can't do it.

533
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
What?

534
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Ikariya Chosuke.

535
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
What?

536
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Ikariya Chosuke.

537
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Ikariya Chosuke.

538
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Hoi!

539
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Kato Shimura.

540
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Tamaki Koji.

541
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Who?

542
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Tamaki Koji.

543
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Tamaki Koji.

544
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
I'm jealous.

545
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
It's like he licked the whole person.

546
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
We're out of time.

547
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Okay.

548
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
That's all.

549
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Yes.

550
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Please write more on the show.

551
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
That's right.

552
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:59,000
If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask us.

553
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
That's all for today.

554
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Thank you very much.

555
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Please come again.

556
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,000
We're recruiting a lot of people for the show.

557
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
That's right.

558
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
We've been recruiting a lot of Nitta-kun, but we're still recruiting more.

559
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
We'll come up with a better idea.

560
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
We'll come up with a better idea.

561
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
We'll come up with a better idea.

562
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
If the show is good, we'll introduce the show.

563
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
That's right.

564
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
We've been coming up with a lot of ideas.

565
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,000
We'll come up with a better idea.

566
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
This is still a bit too much.

567
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
It's too much.

568
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
We can't win with this.

569
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
We can't win.

570
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,000
If you have a bad idea, you'll want to come up with it.

571
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
You can leave that to us.

572
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
We'll come up with a better idea.

573
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
We'll come up with a better idea.

574
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
And we'll come up with a costume other than Nitta.

575
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:03,000
So, the sub-character, Saito, is not wearing underwear.

576
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Do you hear me?

577
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
He's not wearing underwear.

578
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
One camera man, one person.

579
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Saito is wearing underwear.

580
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Please film him wearing underwear.

581
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Let's think about it.

582
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
The editor is Suga.

583
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Saito is wearing underwear.

584
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
I want him to say it.

585
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
That's right.

586
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Let's give him a name.

587
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Takasu.

588
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Tsuchiya.

589
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Suga.

590
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Saito.

591
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
What was it? Yanaoka.

592
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
We'll come up with a better idea.

593
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Goodbye.

594
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
This program was brought to you by

595
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Sannaku.

596
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Oyama International Products.

597
00:23:52,000 --> 00:24:14,000
