1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
This program is brought to you by these sponsors.

2
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
It's been a while, hasn't it?

3
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
It's been a long time.

4
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
It's been two and a half months since I last came here.

5
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Oh, really?

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I came here on March 11th.

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Well, you didn't.

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
No, I did.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Well, it's the atmosphere, right?

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
What atmosphere?

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Mentally.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
No, no, no, no, no.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I did, I did.

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
It's been a long time.

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Well, I missed you.

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
But I didn't change the set.

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Well, that's...

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Oh, is that so?

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Otherwise...

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Now that you've changed, you've become a bit of a hawaiian.

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
What's a hawaiian?

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
You're a hawaiian, aren't you?

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
No, I'm not.

24
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Why are you making that face?

25
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Don't you know what a hawaiian is?

26
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Not everyone knows.

27
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Well, I think you'll find out next week's Nakabakura.

28
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'll find out now.

29
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Oh, really?

30
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
You didn't do that much?

31
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
No, I didn't.

32
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
That's kind of weird.

33
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
But if your legs are 100% healthy, what would you be like?

34
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Well, I should be about 70 or 80.

35
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Oh, really?

36
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
But I can't run.

37
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
You can't run?

38
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Why?

39
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Because it hurts.

40
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
That's very easy to understand.

41
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
The professor's staff made me something great.

42
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
What is it?

43
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:55,000
What is it?

44
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:02,000
If you're tired from talking, you can talk like this.

45
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
You're the standing lord.

46
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
That's cool.

47
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I'm not going to say it now, but you're the standing lord.

48
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Oh, really?

49
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
That's very cool.

50
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
You're too sweet.

51
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I'm already standing up and walking.

52
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Why?

53
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
We've been friends for a long time.

54
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
You always say that your knees hurt.

55
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
That's terrible.

56
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I wanted to talk and see everyone's faces as soon as possible.

57
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
There it is.

58
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
That's the worst part.

59
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Why are you laughing?

60
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
It was a long time.

61
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
If it was just broken, it would have been faster.

62
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
This human body was broken.

63
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I should have fixed all the bad parts.

64
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
No.

65
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I can't take it because it's broken.

66
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
What's wrong with you?

67
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Why are you full of scars?

68
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
What's wrong with you?

69
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Why are you full of scars?

70
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
The skin peeled off a while ago.

71
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
The skin peeled off?

72
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
There's nothing to peel off.

73
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Why are you full of scars?

74
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
What's wrong with you?

75
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
What's wrong with you?

76
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I was shaking to see if I could play golf.

77
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
My hands were shaking.

78
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
You couldn't catch up?

79
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I couldn't catch up.

80
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
You haven't played golf for a long time?

81
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I haven't played golf for a long time.

82
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I see. I should have fixed it.

83
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
What?

84
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
What's wrong with you?

85
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I have to wear a headband.

86
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
You...

87
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
That's right.

88
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
You're angry at the headband, aren't you?

89
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Yes, I am.

90
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
You're not angry at me, are you?

91
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
You're full of anger, aren't you?

92
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Your headband.

93
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
You're angry at the headband, aren't you?

94
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Me?

95
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
You're angry at the headband, aren't you?

96
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Both of you.

97
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Next week is the last episode.

98
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Stop talking.

99
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
You can look back.

100
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,000
It's one episode before the fire in the candle goes out.

101
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I did it again, didn't I?

102
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
What did you do?

103
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
A prophecy.

104
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
A prophecy? That's a coincidence.

105
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
In the past...

106
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
There were many times, right?

107
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Like when a meteorite fell.

108
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
It happened, didn't it?

109
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
In that incident.

110
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
That happened, but you still said I didn't have enough glasses.

111
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I didn't say I didn't have enough glasses.

112
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I was surprised when I heard this.

113
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I thought you were wearing them properly.

114
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
No, I was preparing for it.

115
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I was surprised when I heard this.

116
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I...

117
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
What is it?

118
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I...

119
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
It's me, isn't it?

120
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
It's me.

121
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
The world is like the underwater world.

122
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
When I said something in the photo...

123
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
It was about two years ago.

124
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
At that time, there was a photo of Director Ogi.

125
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Director Ogi had this kind of face in the photo.

126
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
When I saw that, I said, I don't have a house.

127
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
A few months after that, there was a disaster.

128
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Your house?

129
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Yes.

130
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
When I saw the city of Kobe, I said, I don't have a house.

131
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
It's really scary, isn't it?

132
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
No.

133
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
It's really cool, isn't it?

134
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Why?

135
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
It's really cool, isn't it?

136
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
It's true.

137
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
That's why I can't say anything bad.

138
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
It's all right.

139
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
It's all right.

140
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
You're stupid.

141
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Your fracture...

142
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
You're lying.

143
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
No, no.

144
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Actually, I knew it.

145
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Why did you say that?

146
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Why didn't you say that?

147
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
No, no.

148
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I didn't dare to say it.

149
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
If I said it, it would be bad.

150
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
But we've been together for more than 10 years.

151
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
It's been 6 years.

152
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Yes, it's been 16 years.

153
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
When I heard that we were going to be together, I said, you have a fracture.

154
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
You'll have it someday.

155
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
It's not like that.

156
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Since then, I've been thinking about having a fracture.

157
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
If it's going to happen someday, you should have told me.

158
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Even if I told you, there's nothing I can do about it.

159
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
That's right.

160
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
What?

161
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
When will it heal completely?

162
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
In about a month.

163
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Really?

164
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Yes.

165
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Really?

166
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
It's going to take a long time.

167
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
It's because you're getting older.

168
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
If you're young, it'll heal quickly.

169
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
It's not like that.

170
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Really?

171
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
If it was a bone, it would heal quickly.

172
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Is that so?

173
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
You've never had a fracture, have you?

174
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
That's right. I've never had a fracture.

175
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Really?

176
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I've never had a fracture.

177
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
That's not true.

178
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I've never had a fracture, and I've never had a physical injury.

179
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
That's annoying.

180
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:58,000
If I were to tell you, including you, the audience, and the people watching TV,

181
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
if I were to say something to you, it would be,

182
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
bean sprouts.

183
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
It's bean sprouts, so it's not a fracture.

184
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I wrote this down for you one by one, and gave it to you.

185
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Really.

186
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Why don't you train more?

187
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Hey, you!

188
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Why don't you train more?

189
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Why don't you train more?

190
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Why don't you train more?

191
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I don't know.

192
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Do you understand?

193
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
For example, when I take off my rubber band, I don't just take it off.

194
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I force myself to take it off even if I turn around.

195
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
If you do that, your body will be trained.

196
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
For example, it's easy to take off your rubber band like this,

197
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
but if you turn around and take it off like this,

198
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
this will...

199
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
This part will be trained.

200
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
If you're aware of it, you can do six of these.

201
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
You can do six of these?

202
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
No, really.

203
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
You're damaging yourself.

204
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Damaging?

205
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
You're bullying yourself.

206
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Damaging and lucky.

207
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Do you understand?

208
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
If you don't say it, I understand.

209
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
It's better to train your body more.

210
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Then you shouldn't drink milk.

211
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Then you shouldn't drink milk.

212
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I don't drink it.

213
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
If you drink milk, your bones won't break.

214
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
If you drink milk, your bones won't break.

215
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
No, they won't break.

216
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I've been trained to the point where I can do karate chop.

217
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I've been trained to the point where I can do karate chop.

218
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
You'll understand when you see it.

219
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I'll let you chop.

220
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
No, no.

221
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
You're not Masu Oyama.

222
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Wait a minute.

223
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
If it's Masu Oyama, it'll break for sure.

224
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
But if it's me, it'll be fine.

225
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
There's no point, right?

226
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
It's fine.

227
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
It's fine.

228
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Even though your leg is injured, you shouldn't do that.

229
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
It's fine!

230
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Then do it.

231
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
What?

232
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
What?

233
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Hurry up and do it.

234
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
What?

235
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
What did you just say?

236
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
What did you just say?

237
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
You said, huh?

238
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
That's the sound here, right?

239
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
But it really hurts.

240
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
It's fine.

241
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
After all, the way you train is different.

242
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Seriously, why do you all have bean sprouts?

243
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
The modern people eat too much English food.

244
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
That's not true.

245
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
What kind of food do you usually eat?

246
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
For me, it's senmai.

247
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
It's not senmai, it's genmai.

248
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Genmai, genmai.

249
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I'm sorry!

250
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
It's fine, it's fine.

251
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
You're going to say that to a real idiot!

252
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Seriously!

253
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I eat something like genmai.

254
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Genmai, right?

255
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
It's a big mistake to think that sports are good for your body.

256
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
You shouldn't do sports.

257
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
What do you mean?

258
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I told you to train.

259
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Training is different from doing sports.

260
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:25,000
The exercise you do in your daily life is because your body was made to do it.

261
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
For example, taking an eraser.

262
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Taking an eraser is normal in your daily life, so it's fine.

263
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
But if you take an eraser and put it in a bowl...

264
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
It's not good for your daily life.

265
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Because of that, your body refuses to do it.

266
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
It refuses to do it.

267
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Because of that, your body becomes more and more old.

268
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Is that true for everything?

269
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
That's true.

270
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Because no one can blame you for kicking so much.

271
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Isn't that right?

272
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
That's how it is.

273
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
But even if you're a soccer player, your legs are like this.

274
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
That's because I'm trying so hard.

275
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
What are you trying so hard for?

276
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
My body is trying to catch up with me.

277
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Really? Really?

278
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
If I use my muscles, I can do this at first.

279
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
But I use them in a strange way.

280
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Really? Really?

281
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
It's like this.

282
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
You can't do it with your legs like this.

283
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
It's different. Everyone is doing it slowly, but it's getting more and more like this.

284
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:34,000
So I'm doing it, I'm doing it, I'm doing it, I'm doing it.

285
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Don't say that.

286
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
At first, say it to a boy.

287
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
The second time, say it to a girl.

288
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I'm doing it, I'm doing it.

289
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
It's not good.

290
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Sports can be done on a Famicom.

291
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
You can't move your fingers on a Famicom.

292
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Do you know Star Fox?

293
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I know, I know.

294
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
It's like this.

295
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
When you defeat a big boss, it comes like this.

296
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,000
So when you defeat a big boss, you hit it like this.

297
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:08,000
It feels good.

298
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
As expected of a big boss.

299
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
It's not very stimulating.

300
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
It's like this.

301
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I didn't make it for that.

302
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Do it with that special thing.

303
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
That's it.

304
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I'm going to defeat it.

305
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I'm going to jump at first.

306
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
A nurse or stewardess will come out.

307
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:40,000
When I get rid of it, it's like this.

308
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
The enemy is coming while I'm doing it.

309
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,000
It's a boss, so if you defeat the boss once, there's a break for a while.

310
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
You don't have to do it in a hurry.

311
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
You can do it like this.

312
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
It's coming out like this, so it's just right.

313
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:01,000
If you defeat it while doing this, it will come out.

314
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I'm going to go to the next stage with a clear mind.

315
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
You're really smelly.

316
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
You're really smelly.

317
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Don't say that.

318
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I'm going to do it while saying that.

319
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Is that so?

320
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
It's a completely unrelated story.

321
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Do you know how smelly the car in Tokyo is?

322
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I've been saying it for a long time.

323
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Why can't you see the mirror?

324
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
What do you mean?

325
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Something's going on.

326
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
There's a T-shape.

327
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:47,000
There's a mirror on the T-shape road.

328
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
You can't see it, can you?

329
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I can't see it.

330
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
What do you mean?

331
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Are you going to come in with a mint?

332
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
No.

333
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
There's a T-shape.

334
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
There's a mirror over there.

335
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,000
If you go this way, you can see it.

336
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
That's it.

337
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:14,000
My bonnet is coming out.

338
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I can see it, so it's okay.

339
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
It's not okay.

340
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
The car body is coming out.

341
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Even if the car body comes out halfway, it won't get in the way.

342
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:31,000
It's okay if your face comes out of the bonnet.

343
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:37,000
You're going to be here for a long time.

344
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:42,000
It's okay if it doesn't get in the way.

345
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Do you know the taxi?

346
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
The door opens.

347
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
If you close it, you'll get angry.

348
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I did it with my hand.

349
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Try it.

350
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
You'll get angry.

351
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I'm doing it here.

352
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Do you know why I'm so angry?

353
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
There's a door that opens.

354
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:05,000
If you close it, you'll get angry.

355
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,000
That's why I'm so angry.

356
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Luigi Talent.

357
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Is it similar?

358
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
That's right.

359
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Was it Dentsu?

360
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I don't know.

361
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I'm looking it up somewhere.

362
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:21,000
It's the same kind of talent as this talent.

363
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
They're doing it on their own.

364
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Tsuruya's Luigi Talent has three.

365
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
It's weird.

366
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
I want to know my Luigi Talent.

367
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
He'll tell me if I call him.

368
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Really?

369
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I think your Luigi Talent is Izumiya Shigeru.

370
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
It was on something.

371
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I think so.

372
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
It's on the women's weekly magazine.

373
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
It's similar.

374
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
The face is similar.

375
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
It's not like that.

376
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
It's not like that.

377
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
It's a character.

378
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Matsutaka and Hong Kong are similar.

379
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
It's similar.

380
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
It's similar.

381
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
When I first heard it, I was surprised.

382
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Then look at it properly.

383
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:14,000
This is the origin of curry udon.

384
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I used to think it was curry udon.

385
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
It's so stupid.

386
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Is it good?

387
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Hong Kong and Matsutaka.

388
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
It's definitely like that.

389
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I don't know about that, but it's similar.

390
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
It's similar.

391
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Really?

392
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I want to see it again.

393
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I don't know about your Luigi Talent.

394
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:41,000
It's Izumiya Shigeru.

395
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I know Izumiya Shigeru.

396
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:51,000
It's a rotten talent.

397
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
It's a rotten talent.

398
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,000
It's a rotten talent.

399
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I want to see it every time.

400
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Hong Kong and Matsutaka are similar.

401
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
It's definitely like that.

402
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Everyone is being deceived.

403
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I've been saying that there is no such thing as a rotten talent for a long time.

404
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I'm going to make a movie.

405
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Do you know the last movie?

406
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:26,000
It's a rotten talent.

407
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
It's a rotten talent.

408
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
It's a rotten talent.

409
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
It's scary.

410
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
You've never seen it, have you?

411
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I've seen it on TV once in a while.

412
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I'm surprised when I see it.

413
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
You've seen it, haven't you?

414
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
It's a rotten talent.

415
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
What are you doing?

416
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Make a cute face.

417
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Hey!

418
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Wow!

419
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
It's nostalgic.

420
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
It's a cotton ball.

421
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
It's a cotton ball.

422
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,000
When you become like this, you will never open your own eyes.

423
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I opened my own eyes.

424
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
You have a dirty temper.

425
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
You open your eyes and look at the atmosphere.

426
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
You open your eyes and look at the atmosphere.

427
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
It's so dirty.

428
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I can't open my own eyes.

429
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
I was found out.

430
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I can't open my own eyes.

431
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:32,000
That's right, but you can open your own eyes.

432
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
What's that?

433
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I don't need it.

434
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
It's a bed sheet.

435
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
No!

436
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,000
It's a sleeping bag, but I don't need a bed sheet.

437
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Thank you very much.

438
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I have a question for Mr. Matsumoto.

439
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Mr. Matsumoto is a super underwear collector.

440
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:58,000
In particular, he chooses his underwear from a collection of 1,000 pieces every morning.

441
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Among them, there is a very special one.

442
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
If you wear this, you can take down any opponent in one shot.

443
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
It's a dream underwear.

444
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Can you tell me about Super Hitoshi Magnum?

445
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Sure.

446
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
It has nothing to do with underwear.

447
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
What is it?

448
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
You can take it down in one shot.

449
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Isn't there a fashion that you can't show?

450
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I know that, but I can't take it down in one shot because I'm wearing this.

451
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
But there is a fashion that you can't show.

452
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I know that, but I can't take it down in one shot because I'm wearing this.

453
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
It's a fashion that you can't show.

454
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
What is Super Hitoshi Magnum today?

455
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Today, my side is a little knitted.

456
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
What?

457
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
My side is a little knitted.

458
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
What?

459
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,000
My back side is a little knitted.

460
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
What is it?

461
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
This is not the kind of knitted I wore today.

462
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:54,000
It's the kind of knitted I wore when I wore it before.

463
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
It's a little knitted.

464
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
It's always knitted.

465
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,000
It's always knitted.

466
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
What are you talking about?

467
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
The one I like the most is the string.

468
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
The long string.

469
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,000
What kind of length is that?

470
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
It's about 2 cm long.

471
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
It's made of Persian carpet.

472
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
You don't buy it?

473
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I don't buy it.

474
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I wrap it like this.

475
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:28,000
That's sick.

476
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Why?

477
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
That's sick.

478
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
It's not sick.

479
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
This is the most fashionable.

480
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
It's the ultimate underwear.

481
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
In the end, if you wear it, you can make underwear.

482
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
There's nothing around here.

483
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
There's nothing around here.

484
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,000
And then, you can pull out your panties.

485
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
What?

486
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
You can pull out your panties.

487
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
And then, when it's time, you can make a woman lie down.

488
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:58,000
And then, when it's time, you can make a woman lie down.

489
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
You don't do it when it's hot?

490
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
I don't do it when it's hot.

491
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I do it when it's hot.

492
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,000
It's a little like this.

493
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Sometimes, I do it like this.

494
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
That's...

495
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Teach me how to make a woman lie down.

496
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
That's how to make a woman lie down.

497
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
I didn't say anything.

498
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I just said it.

499
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I accepted it, so I can't do it anymore.

500
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:35,000
The other day, I asked Mr. Matsumoto, who was active as a professional specialist in FBI psychological profiling.

501
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:40,000
What should you do to distinguish between a woman's acting and her true feelings?

502
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,000
It was a light conversation.

503
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:52,000
At least, the woman I've ever held has never acted.

504
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Hmm...

505
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Well, I'm...

506
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Well, I'm...

507
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
I can't stand it anymore.

508
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
That's the worst.

509
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I can't stand it anymore.

510
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
I'm a legendary wimpo.

511
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
What?

512
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:16,000
That's why I can see it now.

513
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
That's...

514
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
A man should try it once.

515
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
No, I want to try it.

516
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
You say it's good, right?

517
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
When you say it, you say,

518
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Yes, sir!

519
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:35,000
But when you're acting, you say,

520
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:41,000
What time is it tomorrow?

521
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:48,000
What did you do tomorrow?

522
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
I'm a professional.

523
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:55,000
But if you're asked if you're acting, what would you do?

524
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
I don't want to say that I'm scared.

525
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
I don't want to say that I'm scared.

526
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
No, I understand.

527
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
I don't understand anything, so I didn't ask.

528
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
It's not about the eyes.

529
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
For example, when you feed a cat,

530
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
When you feed a cat,

531
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
If it's a white fish,

532
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:19,000
If it's a white fish,

533
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
That's the woman I've ever held.

534
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:27,000
That's the woman I've ever held.

535
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
That's the woman I've ever held.

536
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
That's not just you, is it?

537
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:38,000
The sofa will jump over.

538
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:58,000
This program was provided by the sponsor you see.
