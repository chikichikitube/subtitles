It's been a while!

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
That's right!

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
It's been a year and a half!

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
That's right!

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000

Tanaka-san is always in 10th place.

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Every time he's in 10th place.

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Excuse me, but it's just so-so.

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Yes?

21
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
It's just so-so, but I feel like I'm going to slip.

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
It's just so-so.

23
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
No, no, no, no.

24
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
This is just my gut feeling.

25
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
No, no, no.

26
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000

56
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Wow, this is your first appearance.

It's your first appearance and you're 9th place.

59

Yes, thank you very much.

60
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
It's decided that your partner will be high-tensioned.

61
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
That's right.

62
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Your eyebrows are like this.

63
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
It's a little strange, isn't it?

64
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
It came off a little.

65
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Oh, that's the stress.

66
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Did your eyebrows come off?

67
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Yes.

68
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000

If you have any complaints, come to me.

77
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
If you have any complaints, come to me.

78
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
My family is a high-class family.

79
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I grew up without knowing how hard it was.

80
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
If you come to me,

81
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I'll beat you up.

82
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I'll beat you up.

83
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Yes, you're a loser.

84
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Thank you very much.

85
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Well, that's how it is.

86

We did it, didn't we?

00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Yes, we did.

94
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
It's the 8th place all of a sudden.

95
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
It's the 8th place all of a sudden.

96
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000

Yes.

98
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
We're in the 10th place.

99
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I want to sell a lot.

100
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I'll do my best.

101
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I want to sell a lot.

102
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I want to sell a lot.

103
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I want to sell a lot.

104
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000

I want to sell a lot.

109
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I want to sell a lot.

110
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
It's rare to say that clearly.

111
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Now, this week's 8th place.

The most interesting man in the world.

00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
This laugh is...

120
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
3, 2, 1...

121
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
It was a laugh! It was a laugh!

122
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000

I see.

126
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
What kind of laugh is this?

127
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Let's do it!

00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
There's information in here.

139
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Arita-san, the VTR from the 7th place was burned into a DVD.

140
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
It was saved as an A-class and showed to the juniors.

141
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
There's information in here.

142
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Huh?

143
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Well...

144
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Was it that complete?

145
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Well...

146
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
You guys...

147
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Even though you may have seen it live...

148
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
You can't do this in front of the downtown.

149
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Even though you know how much it is.

150
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I've done it up to here.

151
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
You've done it up to here.

152
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I think it'll be saved as an A-class again today.

153
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
That's right.

154
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
What will it be?

155
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
The 3rd place...

156
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Shall we move on?

157
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Huh?

158
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Shall we move on?

159
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000

He's wonderful.

181
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
He's like a person who can keep his words for a long time.

182

00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Huh?

190
00:07:41,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Penalty...

191
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Penalty...

192
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,460
Salute!

193
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:18,720
The nipples...

194
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:36,460
The nipples are misaligned, Policeman!

195
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:38,760
I'm glad that the requires two policeman.

196
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,760
Policeman who takes you everywhere.

197
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,760
That was pretty good.

198
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,760
I don't understand anything.

199
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,760
Now, let's go back to the rankings.

200
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,760
This week's 6th place is...

201
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,760
287 points.

202
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,760
Like King Kamehameha,

203
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,760
Hotohara Tohru.

204
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,760
Congratulations!

205
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,760
Hotohara Tohru.

206
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,760
In the past year,

207
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,760
you've been the most nervous.

208
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,760
In the past year?

209
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,760
There's 365 days.

210
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,760
Please do it once.

211
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,760
If I get it,

212
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,760
I want to do my best.

213
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,760
Please do it once.

214
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,760
Are you going to do it?

215
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,760
Even if I do it here,

216
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,760
I don't think anything will come out.

217
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,760
That's true.

218
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,760
I'm going to do it.

219
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,760
Are you going to do it?

220
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,760
This week's 6th place.

221
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,760
Like King Kamehameha,

222
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,760
Hotohara Tohru.

223
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,760
In the season of Kiku,

224
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,760
the cherry blossoms are in full bloom.

225
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,760
What?

226
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,760
It's stuck.

227
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,760
Just one kiss!

228
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,760
Curry udon.

229
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,760
The best is King Kamehameha.

230
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,760
This is the best.

231
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,760
That's touching.

232
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,760
How are you?

233
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,760
Thank you very much.

234
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,760
What kind of ending is this?

235
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,760
What an abrupt ending.

236
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,760
Thank you very much.

237
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,760
What an abrupt ending.

238
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,760
Let's move on to this week's 5th place.

239
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,760
No. 308.

240
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,760
Noodle Philharmonie 2004.

241
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,760
It's here.

242
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:46,760
Thank you very much.

243
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,760
My eyes are closing.

244
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,760
They closed while we were waiting.

245
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,760
It's a little strange, isn't it?

246
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,760
My ears have been saying something.

247
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,760
It's like a Tatsunoko Pro Saku.

248
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,760
Tatsunoko Pro Saku.

249
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,760
It's Tatsunoko Pro Saku.

250
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,760
Don't accept it.

251
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:10,760
It's Tatsunoko Pro Saku.

252
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,760
Stand by, please.

253
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,760
Let's go.

254
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,760
This week's 5th place.

255
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,760
Noodle Philharmonie 2004.

256
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:28,760
Udon is a hit in Japan.

257
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,760
I bet my life on udon.

258
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,760
I bet my life on udon.

259
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,760
I'm hungry.

260
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,760
I'm hungry.

261
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,760
Philharmonie.

262
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,760
Who are you talking to?

263
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,760
Calm down.

264
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,760
Who are you talking to?

265
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,760
Calm down.

266
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:04,760
Who are you talking to?

267
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,760
Thank you very much.

268
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,760
Thank you very much.

269
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,760
Thank you very much.

270
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,760
It's not thank you very much.

271
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,760
Thank you very much.

272
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,760
This week's 4th place.

273
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,760
370 points.

274
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,760
A man called a monkey.

275
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,760
Kokoriko Endo Shouzo.

276
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,760
Congratulations.

277
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,760
That was close, Endo-san.

278
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,760
That's right.

279
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,760
It's rare to get 1st place.

280
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,760
Why are you talking like that?

281
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,760
Endo-san calmed me down.

282
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,760
I got 2 songs at the same time.

283
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,760
I got 2 songs at the same time.

284
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,760
I'm still...

285
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,760
I'm still...

286
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,760
You're still...

287
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,760
I'm going to turn red.

288
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,760
Hamada, I'm going to turn red.

289
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,760
That's why you quit.

290
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,760
It's not because it hurts or something.

291
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,760
It's because you're going to turn red.

292
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,760
It's because I'm going to turn red.

293
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,760
Unfortunately, you didn't get the 3rd place.

294
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,760
If there's a next chance.

295
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,760
I'll do my best.

296
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,760
Standby.

297
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,760
The expectations for Endo-san...

298
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,760
The expectations for Endo-san...

299
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,760
There's something amazing about Japan.

300
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,760
There's something amazing about Japan.

301
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,760
Let's go.

302
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,760
The man called a monkey.

303
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,760
The man called a monkey.

304
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,760
What's this?

305
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:56,760
Tokyo, can you make a watermelon?

306
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,760
I...

307
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,760
This is bad.

308
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:06,760
I ate a watermelon.

309
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:10,760
But you...

310
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,760
Watermelon...

311
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,760
Watermelon...

312
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,760
Don't you want to eat a watermelon?

313
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,760
What did you say?

314
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,760
I sometimes...

315
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:24,760
I sometimes want to eat a watermelon.

316
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,760
Surely, surely...

317
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:30,760
The same feeling as everyone else.

318
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,760
That's it.

319
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,760
That's it.

320
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,760
That was good.

321
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,760
That was good.

322
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,760
That was good.

323
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,760
That was good.

324
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,760
You've done that unfinished job so far.

325
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,760
You've done that unfinished job so far.

326
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:54,760
This week, we've ranked 32nd.

327
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,760
This way, please.

328
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,760
This way, please.

329
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,760
This way, please.

330
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,760
This way, please.

331
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,760
This way, please.

332
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,760
This way, please.

333
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,760
This way, please.

334
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,760
You're dangerous.

335
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:14,760
It feels like Marlin Monroe.

336
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,760
That's right.

337
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,760
The prank of God.

338
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,760
This is a prank.

339
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,760
Stand by.

340
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,760
It's a spotlight.

341
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,760
What's your score?

342
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,760
What's your score?

343
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,760
This week, we've ranked 32nd.

344
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,760
This week, we've ranked 32nd.

345
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,760
Chiara Seiji vs. Chiara brothers.

346
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,760
Chiara Seiji vs. Chiara brothers

347
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,760
I got it!

348
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,760
Don't laugh.

349
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,760
I don't think this is right.

350
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:50,760
You're the one who's doing all the wrong things.

351
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:51,760
Is this really my fault?!

352
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,760
No it's not!

353
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,760
It's your fault!

354
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,760
You're the one who's doing all the wrong things!

355
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:59,760
If you take anything from me, I'm going to kill you!

356
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,760
You're the one who's making things up!

357
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:06,760
If you take anything from me, I'm going to kill you!

358
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:09,760
You're the one who's making things up!

359
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:13,760
If you take anything from me, I'm going to kill you!

360
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,760
I'm going to kill you!

361
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:19,760
It's cold and I don't have anything fun to do, so I want to go home.

362
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,760
When I leave the house,

363
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:26,760
I don't want to bring anything from May because it's surprisingly cold!

364
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:30,760
I don't want to bring anything from May because it's surprisingly cold!

365
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,760
I don't care!

366
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,760
Thank you very much.

367
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,760
Thank you very much!

368
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:43,760
I'm looking forward to the next episode of this spotlight.

369
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:45,760
Let's go!

370
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:48,760
This week's third episode!

371
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:53,760
474 points!

372
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:54,760

Ryuhei Ueshiba!

375
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:02,760
Congratulations!

376
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,760
This is...

377
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,760
This is...

378
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,760
This is...

379
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,760
As expected...

380
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:14,760
What is it?

381
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,760
A dignified aura!

382
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,760
This is the third episode!

383
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:19,760
Thank you very much.

384
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,760
This aura is something you can't really show.

385
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,760
The sense of stability is different.

386
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:27,760
I'm sorry, but let's move on to the third episode.

387
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:28,760
Let's go!

388
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:33,760
Let's go!

389
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:34,760
This week's third episode!

390
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:35,760
Dachou Club!

391
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,760
Ryuhei Ueshiba!

392
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,760
Masked Ninja Man!

393
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:49,760
Masked Ninja is here!

394
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:50,760
Huh?

395
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:51,760
I can't move my arms.

396
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:52,760
Huh?

397
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,760
I can't bend my arms.

398
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,760
I can't do it! I can't do it!

399
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:57,260
I can't do it!

400
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:58,760
Alright, I did it!

401
00:17:58,760 --> 00:17:59,760
Hmph!

402
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:00,760
Listen!

403
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:01,760
You guys!

404
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,760
I don't care where you hide!

405
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,760
Even if you disappear in one piece!

406
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,760
I, the Masked Ninja, will cut you to pieces!

407
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:08,760
Hey!

408
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:09,760
Where did you hide?!

409
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:10,760
You!

410
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,760
Where did you hide?!

411
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:13,760
Come out!

412
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,760
I can see you!

413
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,760
What are you doing?!

414
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,760
I can see you!

415
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,760
Alright, I'll do it like this!

416
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,760
Eh?

417
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:24,760
Alright!

418
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,760
Pon pon no jutsu!

419
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:27,760
Yeah!

420
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,760
Pon pon!

421
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,760
Pon pon pon pon pon!

422
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,760
Thank you very much!

423
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,760
Isn't that person 1st place?

424
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:40,760
He's 3rd place.

425
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:41,760
Ah!

426
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:42,760
Such a high-level thing!

427
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:43,760
No, no, no.

428
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:44,760
2nd place is...

429
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:48,760
2nd place is...

430
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,760
493 points!

431
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,760
The Masked Ninja, I want to erase the rain!

432
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,760
Miyasako Hiroyuki!

433
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,760
Congratulations!

434
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,760
8 yen for a woman?

435
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:10,760
That's too much, Miyasako-san!

436
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:11,760
That was close!

437
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,760
You missed 1st place!

438
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,760
Right?

439
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,760
I think we can expect a lot from today.

440
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:21,760
I think so too.

441
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:22,760
Eh?

442
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:23,760
Yeah?

443
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:24,760
There's a hole in the air.

444
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,760
There's a hole in the air.

445
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,760
There's a hole in the air.

446
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:29,760
It's hard.

447
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:30,760
It's hard.

448
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:31,760
It's hard.

449
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:32,760
Then we should do it quickly.

450
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:33,760
That's right.

451
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,760
That's right.

452
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,760
Then, standby.

453
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,760
Really, what kind of order was that?

454
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,760
I don't know.

455
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,760
It wasn't an order you could say over the phone.

456
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,760
It wasn't.

457
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:48,760
Let's go.

458
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:49,760
2nd place this week.

459
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,760
The Masked Ninja, Miyasako Hiroyuki.

460
00:19:51,760 --> 00:20:05,760
The Masked Ninja, Miyasako Hiroyuki.

461
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:06,760
Stop it!

462
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:07,760
What are you doing?

463
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:08,760
No!

464
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:22,760
Ouch!

465
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,760
That was an accident!

466
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:29,760
Policeman!

467
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:31,760
You beat me there?

468
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,760
What?

469
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,760
It hurts!

470
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:39,760
The 2nd place is still in the top 10

471
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,760
Is that okay?

472
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:42,760
I mean...

473
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:45,760
Who is the 1st place?

474
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,760
That's how it is

475
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:48,760
Really

476
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,760
The 1st place is...

477
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,760
556 points

478
00:20:55,760 --> 00:21:08,760
Com-sama help, Yamasaki Hose

479
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,760
It's scary

480
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:11,760
That's right

481
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,760
I put on makeup

482
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,760
I understand

483
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,760
That's amazing

484
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:18,760
It took a long time and money

485
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:19,760
It took a while

486
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,760
How long did it take to put on makeup?

487
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:25,760
About 30 minutes

488
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:26,760
That's faster

489
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:27,760
It took longer

490
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,760
It really did

491
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:29,760
Did it blur?

492
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,760
Did it blur?

493
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:34,760
If it did, then it was blurred

494
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:39,760
If it didn't, then it wasn't blurred

495
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,760
It was a convenient talk

496
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,760
That's right, thank you

497
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:48,760
Thank you very much

498
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50,760
Can we look forward to this?

499
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,760
It's the 1st place

500
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,760
With this much makeup

501
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:55,760
I feel like I can do it today

502
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:56,760
Really?

503
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:59,760
You look calm today

504
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:00,760
I can look forward to it

505
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,760
I think you can

506
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:03,760
Let's go

507
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,760
This week's 1st place, Yamasaki Hose

508
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,760
Com-sama help

509
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:15,760
Yamasaki Hose

510
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:18,760
It's Naomi

511
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,760
I don't like smoke

512
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,760
I don't like smoke

513
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,760
I don't like smoke

514
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:29,760
I don't like smoke

515
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:33,760
I don't like smoke

516
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:43,760
I don't like smoke

517
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,760
Com

518
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:50,760
I don't want to slip

519
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,760
I don't want to slip

520
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:59,760
I don't want to slip

521
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:02,760
Policeman

522
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:03,760
Policeman

523
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,760
I don't understand

524
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:06,760
What should I say?

525
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:07,760
My nipples are coming out

526
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:08,760
My nipples are coming out

527
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:09,760
My nipples are coming out

528
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,760
Policeman

529
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,760
My nipples are coming out

530
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,760
Policeman

531
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,760
Stand up

532
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,760
That's amazing

533
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:24,760
I don't remember what I want to slip

534
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:27,760
Everyone, let's take a commemorative photo

535
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,760
Let's look at the camera

536
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:33,760
Let's take a commemorative photo

537
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,760
Thank you very much

538
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,760
Thank you very much

539
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,760
It didn't mean much

540
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,760
That's right

541
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,760
I'm really sorry

542
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:46,760
I'm sorry to the staff

543
00:23:46,760 --> 00:24:03,760
