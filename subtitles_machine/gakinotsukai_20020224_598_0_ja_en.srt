1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,500
I'm hungry.

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:02,200
Who are you?

3
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:03,200
I'm hungry.

4
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:04,400
Why are you hungry?

5
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,700
I don't know. I'm hungry.

6
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:12,200
I think I ate too much chocolate.

7
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:12,900
It's obvious.

8
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:15,000
You didn't drink that much, did you?

9
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,600
I wasn't being funny.

10
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:17,600
I know why.

11
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,400
You didn't drink that much.

12
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:20,400
There she is! There she is!

13
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,000
There she is! There she is!

14
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:21,800
There's Hama-chan!

15
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,000
Hama-chan!

16
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,300
Hey, hey, hey.

17
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:27,200
Hurry up and go.

18
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,600
Hama-chan?

19
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:30,200
Oh, dear.

20
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:32,500
Hamada-san.

21
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,700
I brought some chocolates.

22
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:36,400
It's okay.

23
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:37,600
What day is it today?

24
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,400
It's late.

25
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,400
I'm sorry I'm late.

26
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:40,400
It's okay.

27
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,200
Please go out with me.

28
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,800
Why?

29
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,200
Hey, hey, hey.

30
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,000
Just go out with me.

31
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,300
You said you'd do it.

32
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:49,000
There's no point.

33
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,400
Just go with me!

34
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,900
Last year, during Valentine's Day,

35
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:54,400
Mori-san came to Hamada's home

36
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,900
to confess her passionate love.

37
00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:02,400
In order to receive her love, she had to go through a battle with Hamada, but unfortunately, she lost her dream.

38
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:05,400
After that, on Hamada's birthday, Mori-san Chu appeared again.

39
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:12,400
Hamada had to go to the filming site of the drama she was starring in, but her love for Oshima was never fulfilled.

40
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,400
And this time, Mori-san Chu has come again.

41
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:22,400
Oshima's Love Story

42
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,400
This program is brought to you by the following sponsors.

43
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,400
I don't need it!

44
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,400
What?

45
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,400
It's because you had your hair stretched for Hama-chan, right?

46
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,400
I don't need it!

47
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,400
It's fine!

48
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,400
Please do it!

49
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,400
Wait, wait, wait!

50
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,400
Hey, hey, wait a minute!

51
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:46,400
You know, Hamada-san is a pain in the ass. You too, right?

52
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,400
That's right.

53
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,400
You two have nothing to do with each other, right?

54
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,400
What?

55
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,400
No, no, no.

56
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,400
Maybe we don't have anything to do with each other.

57
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:55,400
But you're our senior, so you don't have to be so formal.

58
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,400
That's right.

59
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,400
It's our story, really.

60
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,400
It's our story.

61
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,400
Well, Hama-chan is Hama-chan.

62
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,400
We call her Hamada-san.

63
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,400
Then you can call her Hama-chan.

64
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,400
No, no, no.

65
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,400
You don't have to do that.

66
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,400
Senior or junior?

67
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:10,400
We can't look directly at each other.

68
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,400
What do you mean?

69
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,400
I don't know what you mean.

70
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,400
Just look at him.

71
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,400
Okay, okay.

72
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,400
Hey, you're so erotic.

73
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,400
What?

74
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,400
What do you mean being erotic?

75
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,400
You're the erotic pig.

76
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,400
You're the erotic pig.

77
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,400
You're the erotic pig.

78
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,400
What are you talking about?

79
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,400
You're not saying anything to your senior.

80
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,400
Shut up.

81
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,400
Don't talk.

82
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,400
You're going to make it dark.

83
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,400
Hey, don't talk.

84
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,400
You'll make it dark.

85
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,400
Don't talk and you'll make it bright.

86
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,400
You'll make it bright.

87
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,400
You'll make it dark.

88
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,400
Don't say that.

89
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,400
You don't have to do that.

90
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,400
You're still a golden child, but you're dying instantly.

91
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,400
That's not true.

92
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,400
What are you talking about?

93
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,400
We're doing our best!

94
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,400
Shut up!

95
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,400
We don't know who you are!

96
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,400
Shut up!

97
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,400
Shut up!

98
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,400
Shut up!

99
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,400
Go home!

100
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,400
Go home!

101
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,400
Go home!

102
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,400
Go home!

103
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,400
Go home!

104
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,400
Go home!

105
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,400
Go home!

106
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,400
Go home!

107
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:11,400
It's not like we're friends or anything.

108
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,400
We're just here for work.

109
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,400
I'm sorry.

110
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,400
You're a black-eye.

111
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,400
A black-eye?

112
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,400
A black-eye?

113
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,400
Everyone, let's get back to work.

114
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,400
You do something!

115
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:27,400
You shouldn't be doing something like that!

116
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:31,400
You're the one who should be doing something.

117
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,400
You're the one who should be doing something.

118
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,400
That's right.

119
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,400
You're the one who should be doing something.

120
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,400
You're the one who should be doing something.

121
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,400
Calm down.

122
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,400
Calm down.

123
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,400
You want to give it to him?

124
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,400
Of course.

125
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,400
You know, for example,

126
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,400
you said something before, right?

127
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,400
You said something.

128
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,400
After the show,

129
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,400
you said,

130
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,400
I don't like women who have a lot of hair.

131
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,400
You said you like women who have a lot of hair.

132
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,400
Really?

133
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,400
You don't have a lot of hair.

134
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,400
That's right.

135
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,400
You don't have a lot of hair.

136
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,400
You don't have a lot of hair.

137
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,400
You can't just suddenly say that.

138
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,400
You can't just suddenly say that.

139
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,400
What's wrong?

140
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:20,400
These are scissors for hair.

141
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,400
No way.

142
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,400
No way.

143
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,400
There's a lot of hair.

144
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,400
Amazing.

145
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,400
You can do it now.

146
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,400
Do it, Oshima.

147
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,400
It's scissors.

148
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,400
Oshima.

149
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,400
What's wrong?

150
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,400
What's wrong?

151
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,400
There's a lot of hair.

152
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,400
There's a lot of hair.

153
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,400
Do it, Oshima.

154
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,400
I got it.

155
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,400
I got it.

156
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,400
You should quit.

157
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,400
Go home.

158
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,400
Go home.

159
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,400
You shouldn't do that.

160
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,400
You shouldn't do that.

161
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,400
It hurts.

162
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,400
It hurts.

163
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,400
Oshima, what's wrong?

164
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,400
It hurts.

165
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,400
It hurts.

166
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,400
It hurts.

167
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,400
Go home.

168
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,400
You should show it to Hamada.

169
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,400
You should show it to Hamada.

170
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,400
You shouldn't do that.

171
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,400
You shouldn't do that.

172
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,400
Go home.

173
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,400
You're annoying.

174
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,400
Go home.

175
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,400
Go home.

176
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,400
I told you to go home, so do something.

177
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,400
I told you to go home, so do something.

178
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,400
I had a crush on Hanako.

179
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,400
You had a crush on Hanako?

180
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,400
You had a crush on Hanako?

181
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,400
What did you think?

182
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,400
What did you think?

183
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,400
I don't mind if they set me up with Hanako.

184
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,400
Even if you get caught, you'll be fine.

185
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,400
That's true, but...

186
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,400
You can't do that.

187
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,400
No, I can't.

188
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,400
It's impossible to appeal.

189
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,400
I happened to be there.

190
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,400
I can't do such a good thing.

191
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,400
It's over.

192
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,400
Oh no!

193
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,400
It's a nose hook!

194
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,400
It's attached!

195
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,400
I can do it!

196
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,400
It'll be a big deal.

197
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,400
You can do it!

198
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,400
It hurts.

199
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,400
It hurts.

200
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,400
It hurts!

201
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,400
It hurts!

202
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,400
It hurts!

203
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,400
It hurts!

204
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,400
It hurts!

205
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,400
It hurts!

206
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,400
It hurts!

207
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,400
Wait!

208
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,400
It hurts!

209
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,400
It hurts!

210
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,400
It hurts!

211
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,400
It hurts!

212
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,400
You can't do it!

213
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,400
You said you could do it.

214
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,400
You said it before.

215
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,400
You said it before.

216
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,400
What are you going to do?

217
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,400
What is it?

218
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,400
Speaking of which,

219
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,400
I heard you like warm women.

220
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,400
I heard you like warm women.

221
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,400
I heard you like warm women.

222
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,400
Women.

223
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,400
You like them?

224
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,400
It's hard to make you understand.

225
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,400
It's hard to make you understand.

226
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,400
What do you mean?

227
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,400
This is...

228
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,400
For example, frogs.

229
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,400
You mean the best?

230
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,400
Frogs?

231
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,400
You put them in your stomach and warm them.

232
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,400
You put them in your stomach and warm them.

233
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,400
It's hard to make you understand.

234
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,400
It's hard to make you understand.

235
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,400
You can't make it up.

236
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,400
You can't make it up.

237
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,400
You can't make it up.

238
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,400
It's over!

239
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,400
It's over!

240
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,400
What happened?

241
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,400
It's a fart.

242
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,400
It's a fart.

243
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,400
What is that?

244
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,400
It's over!

245
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,400
You can warm your stomach.

246
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,400
It's over!

247
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,400
It's over!

248
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,400
It's over!

249
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,400
I can't hold it.

250
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,400
I can't hold it.

251
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,400
I feel like a puppy.

252
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,400
Did it get in?

253
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,400
What is it doing?

254
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,400
Where is it?

255
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,400
What is it doing?

256
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,400
What are you doing?

257
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,400
What are you doing?

258
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,400
What are you doing?

259
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,400
What are you doing?

260
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,400
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

261
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:50,400
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

262
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,400
Hamada-chan!

263
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,400
My beloved Hamada-san!

264
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,400
Hamada-chan!

265
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,400
Go!

266
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,400
Don't come!

267
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,400
What's wrong?

268
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,400
Ouch! Ouch!

269
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,400
Ouch! Ouch!

270
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,400
Go over there!

271
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,400
Oh no! Oh no!

272
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,400
Go over there!

273
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,400
Hurry! Hurry!

274
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,400
What's wrong?

275
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,400
What should I do?

276
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,400
Hurry! Hurry!

277
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,400
Over there!

278
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,400
Don't come!

279
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,400
It's embarrassing!

280
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,400
Go home!

281
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,400
Go home!

282
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,400
What's wrong?

283
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,400
Don't go home!

284
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,400
Go home!

285
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,400
You did it just as I told you!

286
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,400
No!

287
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,400
You're not that big!

288
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,400
You're not that big!

289
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,400
You're not that big!

290
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,400
I can't help it, so go home!

291
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,400
Go home!

292
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,400
Go home!

293
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,400
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

294
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,400
I'm sorry!

295
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,400
I'm sorry!

296
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,400
My favorite is the tough woman.

297
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,400
It's all tough.

298
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,400
It's all tough.

299
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,400
I like tough women.

300
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,400
I like tough women.

301
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,400
I like tough women.

302
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,400
I don't know why, but I like tough women.

303
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,400
Hamada-san has a good mouth.

304
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,400
She's good.

305
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,400
That's right.

306
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,400
She's good.

307
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,400
If you go with her lips,

308
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,400
That's right.

309
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,400
If you go with her lips,

310
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,400
You can change her emotions.

311
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,400
It's better to go with her.

312
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,400
You can go if it's Oshima.

313
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,400
Don't go!

314
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,400
You can drop her.

315
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,400
I got it.

316
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,400
I'm pissed off.

317
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,400
I'm pissed off.

318
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,400
Go!

319
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,400
Go!

320
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,400
I'm sorry.

321
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,400
Go!

322
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,400
Go!

323
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,400
I'm sorry.

324
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,400
What's wrong?

325
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,400
What's wrong?

326
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,400
What's wrong?

327
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,400
You're bleeding.

328
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,400
Go!

329
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,400
I'm sorry!

330
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,400
Go!

331
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,400
I'm sorry!

332
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,400
Wait a minute.

333
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,400
Ouch!

334
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,400
What are you doing?

335
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,400
What?

336
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,400
Ouch!

337
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,400
What's wrong?

338
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,400
What's wrong?

339
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,400
I can't see anything.

340
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,400
He's cold.

341
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,400
He's cold, right?

342
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,400
He's cold?

343
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,400
He's really happy.

344
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,400
He's a bit of a long-sleeved guy.

345
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,400
He's a bit of a long-sleeved guy.

346
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,400
He has that kind of desire.

347
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,400
He's really into his job.

348
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,400
He's a bit of a long-sleeved guy, but he's still being teased.

349
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,400
He's a bit of a long-sleeved guy, but he's still being teased.

350
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,400
You guys should help me.

351
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,400
You guys should help me.

352
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,400
I need to go to the bathroom.

353
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,400
You need to go to the bathroom.

354
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,400
You should help me.

355
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,400
You should help me.

356
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,400
What are you doing?

357
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,400
Ouch!

358
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,400
You should help me.

359
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,900
On glasses, hello!

360
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:15,400
Ow ow!

361
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:18,900
My glasses!

362
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:30,400
Who is it?

363
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:33,400
Because I'm at work, I have to return home.

364
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,400
Hama-san

365
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,400
Hama-chan! Hama-chan!

366
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,400
Are you angry?

367
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,400
What should we do? Let's follow them.

368
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,400
Hurry up! We have to tell them how we feel now.

369
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,400
Hurry up!

370
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,400
Your glasses are amazing.

371
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,400
Your glasses are amazing.

372
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,400
The three of you have great glasses.

373
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,400
We can't just let them go like this.

374
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,400
We'll get in their way.

375
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,400
We did a commercial today.

376
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,400
Really? Then let's go and change.

377
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,400
Let's go and change.

378
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:08,400
Hamada is heading to Georgia's commercial shooting location.

379
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:12,400
Hamada, the main character, is a typical Japanese salaryman.

380
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:18,400
At such a busy shooting location, Mori-san and Chuu are hiding in the heat of love.

381
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,400
Let's stop.

382
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,400
Let's go home.

383
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,400
We can't just stop.

384
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,400
Why?

385
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,400
It's not just you guys who have to stop.

386
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,400
Stop it.

387
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:33,400
The commercial is really important.

388
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:36,400
This is a serious atmosphere.

389
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,400
This is no good.

390
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,400
Let's go home.

391
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,400
What should we do?

392
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,400
What should we do?

393
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,400
If you don't stop, we can't talk.

394
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,400
Just accept it.

395
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,400
Just accept it.

396
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,400
What are you saying?

397
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,400
You're Hama-chan's partner, right?

398
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,400
Do something.

399
00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:00,400
If I had to choose...

400
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:05,400
I'm remembering the words I wrote in my graduation letter.

401
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,400
A woman without delicacy is a...

402
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,400
A woman without delicacy is a...

403
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,400
What does that mean?

404
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:15,400
A woman who doesn't have the heart to show her belly or her belly button to everyone.

405
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,400
That's nice.

406
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:21,400
If a woman shows her belly, it's not good.

407
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,400
It's not good.

408
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,400
There's no way you'd show your belly.

409
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,400
That's right.

410
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,400
That's why we're going home.

411
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,400
What?

412
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,400
What is it?

413
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,400
It's amazing.

414
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:38,400
It says it's a pump for women.

415
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,400
What is it for women?

416
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,400
What is it for women?

417
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,400
It's amazing.

418
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,400
You can show your belly with this.

419
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:46,400
Why did you get the item the way you wanted?

420
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,400
I'm going.

421
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,400
Go.

422
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,400
Do your best.

423
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,400
Where are you going?

424
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,400
Don't use the key next door.

425
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,400
Don't use it.

426
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,400
I'm going.

427
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,400
I'm going.

428
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,400
I'm going.

429
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,400
I'm going.

430
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,400
I'm going.

431
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,400
I'm going.

432
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,400
I'm going.

433
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,400
I'm going.

434
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:11,400
That's all for the management strategy of our paper machine.

435
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:15,400
How's it going?

436
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,400
I'm going.

437
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,400
I'm going.

438
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,400
I'm going.

439
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,400
I'm going.

440
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:30,400
Don't you have any good ideas?

441
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,400
Cut.

442
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,400
Who is that guy?

443
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,400
Don't do that.

444
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,400
That's all.

445
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:40,400
I think he was peeing during the commercial shoot.

446
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,400
Go, go, go.

447
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,400
No, no, no.

448
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,400
Help me.

449
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,400
No, no, no.

450
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,400
It hurts.

451
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,400
It hurts.

452
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,400
I think he likes it.

453
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,400
Yeah, he does.

454
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:56,400
I don't think he likes it.

455
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,400
That's not it.

456
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,400
How can I help you?

457
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,400
It's not sharp.

458
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,400
It was long and rough.

459
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,400
It was rough.

460
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:06,400
I wanted it to be faster.

461
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,400
I'm going to the toilet.

462
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,400
Wait, wait, wait.

463
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,400
Go, go, go.

464
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,400
Hurry.

465
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,400
Hurry.

466
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,400
Hurry.

467
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,400
Hurry.

468
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,400
Hurry.

469
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,400
Hurry.

470
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,400
Hurry.

471
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,400
Next is the park.

472
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,400
In the park?

473
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,400
Let's stop.

474
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,400
We're here.

475
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,400
Let's leave Oshima and go home.

476
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,400
That's right.

477
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,400
It has nothing to do with us.

478
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,400
It has something to do with us.

479
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,400
Why?

480
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,400
There's something like three people in the middle of the forest.

481
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,400
I saw it.

482
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,400
It has nothing to do with you.

483
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,400
What?

484
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,400
Let's go home.

485
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,400
You know, right?

486
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,400
Yes.

487
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,400
Right?

488
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,400
He's not like you.

489
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,400
He likes women who are more mischievous.

490
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,400
That's right.

491
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,400
He likes women who are mischievous.

492
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,400
That's right.

493
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,400
He likes mischievous girls.

494
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,400
For example,

495
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,400
He suddenly inflates balloons and scares them.

496
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,400
He suddenly inflates balloons and scares them.

497
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,400
He suddenly inflates balloons and scares them.

498
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,400
He's cute.

499
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,400
I've hugged a girl like that before.

500
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,400
There's no balloon in a place like this.

501
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,400
Let's go home.

502
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,400
Let's go home.

503
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,400
Wait.

504
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,400
What are you guys?

505
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,400
It's just as I thought.

506
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,400
God came down.

507
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,400
Oshima,

508
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,400
Don't be angry.

509
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,400
Let's do it.

510
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,400
Let's make Hama fall.

511
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,400
What are you going to do?

512
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,400
It's starting.

513
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,400
What are you going to do?

514
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,400
It's too late.

515
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,400
What are you doing?

516
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,400
Wait a minute.

517
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,400
What are you doing?

518
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,400
It's too late.

519
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,400
What are you doing?

520
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,400
It's too late.

521
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,400
It's a little bit of a trick.

522
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,400
It's a little bit of a trick.

523
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,400
It's not over yet.

524
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,400
It hurts.

525
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,400
It hurts.

526
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,400
It hurts.

527
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,400
It hurts.

528
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,400
It hurts.

529
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,400
It hurts.

530
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,400
It hurts.

531
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,400
Stop it.

532
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,400
Stop it.

533
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,400
It hurts.

534
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,400
It hurts.

535
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,400
Run away.

536
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,400
Run away.

537
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,400
Run away.

538
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,400
It's dangerous.

539
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,400
It's dangerous.

540
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,400
It hurts.

541
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,400
It hurts.

542
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,400
It hurts.

543
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,400
It hurts.

544
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,400
It hurts.

545
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,400
You guys are men.

546
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,400
Stop it.

547
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,400
I'm sorry.

548
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,400
What are you doing?

549
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,400
You're angry.

550
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,400
No.

551
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,400
Let's think about it calmly.

552
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,400
It's not calm.

553
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,400
You said you would love me.

554
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,400
We are different.

555
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,400
I'm angry because of you guys.

556
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,400
The director was waiting for me to explode.

557
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,400
It's you.

558
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,400
What are you going to do?

559
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,400
What are you going to do?

560
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,400
This love will not be rewarded.

561
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,400
If you continue, you will be beaten.

562
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,400
You don't like it, do you?

563
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,400
I'll do my best.

564
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,400
I'll do my best.

565
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,400
I have to go quickly.

566
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,400
I'm sorry.

567
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,400
Wait.

568
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,400
I'm nervous.

569
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,400
I don't know.

570
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,400
It's hard.

571
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,400
I have to go now.

572
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,400
I have to go now.

573
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,400
I have to go now.

574
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,400
You guys are different.

575
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,400
You guys are different.

576
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,400
I can turn it.

577
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,400
I heard one thing.

578
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,400
He is a woman who turns his head quickly.

579
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,400
I've heard that.

580
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,400
I've heard that.

581
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,400
But he can't help it.

582
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,400
That's right.

583
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,400
He can turn his head and body.

584
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,400
He can turn his head and body.

585
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,400
He can express it.

586
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,400
That's impossible.

587
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,400
That's impossible.

588
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,400
Thank you.

589
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,400
Wait.

590
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,400
I can't go.

591
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,400
I'm going to die.

592
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,400
I'm going to die.

593
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,400
What should I do?

594
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,400
The wind is blowing.

595
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,400
The wind is blowing.

596
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,400
I got it.

597
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,400
I'll turn around.

598
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,400
It's starting again.

599
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,400
Thank you.

600
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:26,400
I'm going to die.

601
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,400
Wait.

602
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,400
Wait.

603
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,400
I can't do it.

604
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,400
I can't do it.

605
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,400
I'm done.

606
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,400
I'm done.

607
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,400
What are you doing?

608
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,400
You should have gone home.

609
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,400
Oshima!

610
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,400
Oshima!

611
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,400
He's doing it!

612
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,400
Hey, Oshima!

613
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,400
Stop it!

614
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,400
Let me go home!

615
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,400
I know, but love is the most important!

616
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,400
Look at that. Can you love that?

617
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,400
Go home.

618
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,400
I'm sorry.

619
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,400
Let's go!

620
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,400
You can't just give up.

621
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,400
I'm going!

622
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,400
50 points for the three of you.

623
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,400
Do you have 50 points?

624
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,400
I came all the way here.

625
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,400
I'm sorry.

626
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,400
It was a very close meeting.

627
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,400
I really want to go home.

628
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,400
I was wondering if there was anything I could say.

629
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,400
I thought about it on the bus.

630
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,400
There was a woman I liked.

631
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,400
A woman who doesn't make you feel like she's opposite sex.

632
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,400
Oh, I see.

633
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,400
She's a nice guy.

634
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,400
She's easy to go out with.

635
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,400
She's like a friend.

636
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,400
She's easy to go out with.

637
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,400
I used to say that she was the type I liked in my sleep.

638
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,400
In your sleep?

639
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,400
But I used to say that many times.

640
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,400
Really?

641
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,400
I'll believe you if you wait.

642
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,400
Okay, I got it.

643
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,400
I got it.

644
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,400
It's hard.

645
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,400
It's hard to overcome.

646
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,400
You say yes to everything.

647
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,400
You say yes to going home.

648
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,400
That's right.

649
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,400
I'll believe you.

650
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,400
You can do it.

651
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,400
I'll believe you.

652
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,400
I'll believe you.

653
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,400
What are you going to do?

654
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,400
It's hard to do it.

655
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,400
It's like a lump of spaghetti.

656
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,400
Look, it's like this.

657
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,400
I don't think I can do it.

658
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,400
I know.

659
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,400
It's started.

660
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:56,400
What?

661
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,400
No way.

662
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,400
No way.

663
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,400
What is this?

664
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,400
I can't feel it.

665
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,400
You can't feel it, right?

666
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,400
I'm an old man.

667
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,400
You're an old man.

668
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,400
This is normal.

669
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,400
You're an old man.

670
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,400
Where did you come from?

671
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,400
Abiru.

672
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,400
Are you kidding me?

673
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,400
You're dirty.

674
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,400
You can come out.

675
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,400
You're just a dog in a sauna.

676
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,400
This is bad.

677
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,400
I can't stop it.

678
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,400
I can't give up.

679
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,400
I can't give up.

680
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,400
I can't give up.

681
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,400
It hurts.

682
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:08,400
I can't give up.

683
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:32,400
I can't give up.
