1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
On the day of the showdown

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Thank you

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
We broke up

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
What?

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
We broke up

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
You broke up?

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Last week we were in a non-air

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm sorry

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I broke up with that woman

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I asked her to appear on TV

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Ah

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
She dumped you?

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
That new girl

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Who is it?

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Who is it?

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Isn't it a different room?

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Old lady?

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Old lady?

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
What's that sound?

20
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
A dog

21
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
What is it?

22
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm getting drunk

23
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Iyama-chan, you said you wanted to do mosaic

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I said I wanted to do mosaic

25
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I got a call from my parents

26
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Ah, really

27
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I don't want to do this alone

28
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Today I'm doing Hamada

29
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
You have a family

30
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
You have a child

31
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
But I wanted to be in the seat

32
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
That may be true

33
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
But we did the opening

34
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I'll go home

35
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Let's go

36
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Ladies and gentlemen

37
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I'll do my best

38
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
You can do it too

39
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
If you do your best, you'll get something

40
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
What will I get?

41
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
If you do your best, Hama-chan will be called cute or cool

42
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
What are you talking about?

43
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Why are you so twisted?

44
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I'm not being told that

45
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
If you do your best, you'll be told that

46
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
You'll be told a lot

47
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I'm not telling anyone

48
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
If I do my best, I'll do my best

49
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
The more I do my best, the more I'll do my best

50
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
He's crazy

51
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
We've been doing it together

52
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Together

53
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Together

54
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
You're getting prettier and prettier

55
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Really

56
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I'm the dirty one

57
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
You can be the dirty one

58
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Is that what you wanted?

59
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
But

60
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I'm the dirty one

61
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I don't know what you're thinking

62
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
You're being cheeky

63
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
You're being called small

64
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
That's the worst

65
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I don't care about the last one

66
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Junon's kind man, number 9

67
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
What?

68
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
What is this?

69
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Let's shake hands

70
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
You're being cheeky

71
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Let's take a picture together

72
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Let's take a picture together

73
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Let's take a picture together

74
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
You're tired, right?

75
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
In the drama, everyday

76
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
It doesn't matter

77
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
It doesn't matter in the drama

78
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I'm going to work

79
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:02,000
If you're on air, you'll be cool

80
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
You're being cheeky

81
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I don't know why I'm like this

82
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
You think that's better?

83
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I don't think so

84
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I want to be told that I'm kind

85
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
If a woman wants a kind man

86
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
It's really dirty

87
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Even if you do something bad, you won't get hit or scolded

88
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Is that what you're thinking?

89
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Definitely

90
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
If it's about me, I'll get hit

91
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,000
You're acting wild again

92
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:43,000
What should I do then?

93
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Are you tired?

94
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
No, I'm fine

95
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
That's good

96
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Are you tired?

97
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Yes

98
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
If you look at me like this, I'll look away

99
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
That's because it's you

100
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Wait

101
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:09,000
The audience is here to see you

102
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I don't know what you're talking about, but I'm pissed off

103
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I don't know what you're talking about, but I'm pissed off

104
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I don't think we're meant to be

105
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
You're talking too much

106
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I have a bad reputation

107
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Who?

108
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Us

109
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Really?

110
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
If there's something I don't like, I'll hit the staff

111
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
They think I have a stick

112
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
What kind of stick is that?

113
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I'm walking around with a stick

114
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I'm in downtown

115
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I'm in downtown with two people

116
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
What do you think?

117
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
If there's something I don't like, I'll hit the staff

118
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
That's the rumor

119
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
No one would believe that

120
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:59,000
If you want to change things, you have to be in downtown

121
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
That's why you have to be in...

122
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Magical Brain Power

123
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Why?

124
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
If you say something, it's something

125
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Why do I have to be in it?

126
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I don't want to be in it with you

127
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
That's really rude

128
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
It's really rude

129
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I'm watching

130
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I can't believe it

131
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,000
It's fun

132
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I want to see it

133
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
You want to see it?

134
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
But you don't want to be in it

135
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I don't want to be in it

136
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I'm sorry

137
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
What kind of atmosphere is that?

138
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I know you very well

139
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I know you

140
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
So even if there's a wall, I can do a gesture

141
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I don't know that

142
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I don't know that

143
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Don't do that

144
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I want to see it

145
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I know you very well

146
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I know you

147
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I know you

148
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I know you

149
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I don't know if I can do that

150
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
It's a dirty image

151
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
That's right

152
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I can't believe someone who does this has a stick

153
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
That's right

154
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
In order to change that image, you should appear

155
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Radical snow power

156
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
My face is so red

157
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I don't know why it's so red

158
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
It's okay, just do it while it's red

159
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Then you can get rid of it

160
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
That's scary

161
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Is it okay?

162
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Yes

163
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Don't laugh

164
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Why is Matsumoto-san so well-bred and elegant?

165
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Do you know?

166
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
No

167
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Do you know why?

168
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Even if the two of you are doing this, it will show

169
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
The house design

170
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I hate that

171
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
The house design

172
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I don't like it so I jumped out

173
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
You jumped out of the house where tatami came out

174
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
No, no

175
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Not that

176
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I jumped out of the original house

177
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
It has nothing to do with the old house

178
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
It has nothing to do with that

179
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
It happened after I jumped out

180
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
What happened?

181
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I'm not like you

182
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I'm the younger sister of my mother

183
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Then I'm your aunt

184
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Aunt

185
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Where are your parents then?

186
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I'm the teacher of Ikebana

187
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:00,000
In your head, the good kid is Ikebana

188
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Not in my head, I'm talking about the real past

189
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I'm not making it

190
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I'm sorry

191
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I'm Ikebana sensei

192
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
My father is the director

193
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Director?

194
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
It was tough

195
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
What was tough?

196
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
What was tough?

197
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
What was tough?

198
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
The discipline?

199
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
The discipline was really tough

200
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Is that so?

201
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Yes

202
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Did you have a hard time?

203
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
What?

204
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I couldn't do this

205
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I was at home

206
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I was at home

207
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I thought I was free

208
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,000
If I did this, my mother would say

209
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I didn't do anything

210
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
My mother is not a high school student

211
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
My father is a director

212
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Don't say director

213
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I don't understand

214
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I heard you

215
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I heard you touched it

216
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I heard you touched it

217
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
So you don't have to say it correctly

218
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
My father

219
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Matsumoto-san has a mirror that only reflects beautiful things

220
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
What does it reflect?

221
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Does it have a mirror?

222
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
It does

223
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Of course it doesn't reflect what it sees

224
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I'll say this clearly

225
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
It doesn't reflect

226
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
That means I'm not beautiful

227
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
If it reflects in the mirror

228
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
If it reflects in the mirror

229
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I thought I should break this mirror

230
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I put it in my bedroom

231
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,000
One time I had sex with my girlfriend

232
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
You're saying it clearly

233
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
At that time it was reflected

234
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Our sex

235
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
When I saw it

236
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
How big is it?

237
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
How big is it?

238
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
That's good

239
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
The three of you are the markers

240
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Good sound

241
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Matsumoto-san, I have a question

242
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
From the surprise box, did something surprising come out?

243
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Stop it

244
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
From Matsumoto-san's body

245
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
You should read the paper that spreads

246
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
It's a paper button

247
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Listen

248
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Something surprising came out

249
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Isn't this person blue?

250
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Something surprising came out

251
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
From Matsumoto-san's body

252
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
What kind of surprising thing came out?

253
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Isn't that a report?

254
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Yesterday there was a guest

255
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Everyone said it

256
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
The person in the middle of the guest

257
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:26,000
That person is Kaona

258
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
You really shouldn't think about it

259
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
That person wanted to watch the show

260
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
So he wrote a postcard

261
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Hopeful hope

262
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I don't think it's one or two

263
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
He wrote three or four

264
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
He finally got it

265
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
He thought he could finally meet downtown

266
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
He was looking at it

267
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
He was surprised

268
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
How did you feel when you went home?

269
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Today was fun, Mayumi-chan

270
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Right?

271
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Why are you so depressed?

272
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
That's what happens

273
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
You can't tell your mother

274
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
That you got sick

275
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
You can't tell your mother that you got sick

276
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Your mother will worry

277
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Why?

278
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
To be honest, I've never been sick

279
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Seriously

280
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Really?

281
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Yes

282
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
That's why I...

283
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Sometimes I make a sound from my butt

284
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
You're sick

285
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Sick

286
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I act like I'm sick

287
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
You're annoying

288
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
You're sick

289
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
There's a saying

290
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
You think you're sick

291
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
So people think you're sick too

292
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
You're sick, but I'm not

293
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
It might be the same sound

294
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
It might be similar sound

295
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
You're sick, but I'm not

296
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
You're sick, but I'm not

297
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
In my case, my butt and butt rubbed against each other

298
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
You're sick

299
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
You can't act like that

300
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
What was that?

301
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
It sounded like a bell

302
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
It wasn't a bell

303
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
It sounded like a bell

304
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
It's different

305
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I don't know

306
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Your butt is moving like this

307
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
It's sick

308
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Yours is sick, but mine isn't

309
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I'm surprised

310
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Did you remember?

311
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Really

312
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
It's sick

313
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
It's not sick

314
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
It's not

315
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
That's why

316
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
It's rubbing against each other

317
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
It's different

318
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
In the middle of autumn

319
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I'm crying

320
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
That's funny

321
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Is it true that Hama-chan's butt doesn't move at all?

322
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Your butt is amazing

323
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
How is it amazing?

324
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
It's smelly

325
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Everyone is smelly

326
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
But in your case, it's not that smelly

327
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,000
As you all know, I rub my butt

328
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I think everyone will rub their butt when you're pooping

329
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
But your butt

330
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
You don't rub it

331
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
You don't have a place to deliver it

332
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
No one will take it away

333
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
It's a little smelly

334
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Where will you take it?

335
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I think

336
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
You'll be depressed

337
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
You have to roll it

338
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
If you think like that

339
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Where is it?

340
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Mama, I had a hard time today

341
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Roll it

342
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I want to drink a lot

343
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Like a snack

344
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I don't want to do it anymore

345
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
What's wrong? Did something bad happen?

346
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
What are you doing?

347
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,000
If you want to roll it, roll it

348
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I'll give you a card

349
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I don't want to do it anymore

350
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I'll do my best

351
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Thank you for your hard work

352
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Let's go

353
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Let's go

354
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
We have to talk

355
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Let's go

356
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Are you going alone?

357
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Alone?

358
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
You have to order

359
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Let's go

360
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Why don't you drink it?

361
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I don't know

362
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
There it is

363
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
It's walking

364
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Look at that

365
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
It's walking like a blue sea

366
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I don't know who to tell

367
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Look at this

368
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
It's shaking

369
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
It's not thinking about anything

370
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Look

371
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
What is it?

372
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
It's moving

373
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
It's moving

374
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
What is it?

375
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Do you want to do it?

376
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
The best soap land

377
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Suyahime

378
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Soap?

379
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Do you want to go to the soap?

380
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
I don't want to go to the soap

381
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I'll be at the venue

382
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:09,000
So you want to go to the soap?

383
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
It's running

384
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
It's running

385
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
You're a fool

386
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
That's not true

387
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Let's stop

388
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I won't bite

389
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Let's get off

390
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Let's get off

391
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
It's a soap

392
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
It won't come out for 90 minutes

393
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
It won't come out

394
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Let's stop

395
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I won't bite

396
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
It's refreshing

397
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Everyone should watch this

398
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
It's really good

399
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
It's good

400
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
It's good

401
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
It's good

402
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
It's coming

403
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Let's go home

404
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
It's refreshing

405
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
What is it?

406
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
It's good

407
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Let's go

408
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
It's a good soap land

409
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
It's a really good soap land

410
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Let's go home

411
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
termuo

412
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
It's coming

413
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
It's coming

414
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
It's coming

415
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
It's clean

416
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I also want to see Mamma

417
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Mamma is doing

418
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
You'll meet her

419
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
I will meet her

420
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
It's like a movie.

421
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
It's like a movie.

422
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
It's like an orange juice.

423
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
It's like an orange juice.

424
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I'm gonna get on the car.

425
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I'm gonna get on the car.

426
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I'm gonna get on the car.

427
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Come here.

428
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I'm gonna get on the car.

429
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
There he is.

430
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
There he is.

431
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Where is he?

432
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Where is he?

433
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Where is he?

434
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
What's that?

435
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Is that a sara-kin?

436
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
It's a sara-kin.

437
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Why is it a sara-kin?

438
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
It's money.

439
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
It's a good car.

440
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
It's a good car.

441
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
It's full of soap.

442
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Why is it full of soap?

443
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
It's running out of money.

444
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
What are you doing?

445
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
It's full of soap.

446
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
It's full of soap.

447
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
It's full of soap.

448
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
It's full of soap.

449
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
It's full of soap.

450
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
It's full of soap.

451
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
You're going to the orange juice.

452
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
What was that orange juice?

453
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
You wanted to have a little break.

454
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
You wanted to have a little break.

455
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
You wanted to have a little break.

456
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
I'm thirsty.

457
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I'm thirsty.

458
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
It's refreshing.

459
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
It's refreshing.

460
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I'm already out of the car.

461
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
I don't know what to do.

462
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
You got caught again.

463
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
You got caught again.

464
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Why did you do that?

465
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
You should have borrowed it.

466
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
I was going to finish it on the second try.

467
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
It's a little boring.

468
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
It's a little boring.

469
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
It's a little boring.

470
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I don't know what to do.

471
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
What are you thinking about?

472
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
I'm going to give up.

473
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
That's right.

474
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
You got caught again.

475
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
You got caught again.

476
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
You got caught again.

477
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
You got caught again.

478
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Why did you do that?

479
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
It's not because you're very happy.

480
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
It's not because you're very happy.

481
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
I can't do this anymore.

482
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
I think you should say it.

483
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
I can't do it with this.

484
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
I think you should say it.

485
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
I don't think it's so good.

486
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
I can't do it with this.

487
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
I can't do it.

488
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
I don't think so.

489
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
I think you should say it.

490
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,680
You shouldn't use your tail.

491
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,600
Or you'll have to make an excuse later.

492
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,680
But what should I do with this?

493
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:02,280
Don't make an excuse. Just hold the scene.

494
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:05,120
Because this is really good.

495
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,520
Refreshing.

496
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,520
This is good.

497
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,520
Let's go.

498
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:11,520
Let's go.

499
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,520
What are you doing?

500
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:13,520
Let's go.

501
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:16,520
You shouldn't say that.

502
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:24,520
Let's go.

503
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,520
Hey!

504
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,520
Hey!

505
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,520
Hey!

506
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,520
What is this?

507
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,520
Excuse me.

508
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:31,520
Who are you?

509
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,520
Hamada?

510
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:33,520
Excuse me.

511
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,520
This is not right.

512
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:41,520
What are you doing?

513
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,520
Excuse me.

514
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:48,520
Excuse me.

515
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:51,520
Where have you been?

516
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,520
What?

517
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,520
Where have you been?

518
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:56,520
I was wrong.

519
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:57,520
What?

520
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,520
You didn't change your mind?

521
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,520
I shouldn't have done that.

522
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:04,520
That's strange.

523
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:07,520
What's wrong with you?

524
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,520
You were a kid.

525
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:12,520
I told you to stop.

526
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:13,520
Why?

527
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,520
Who are you?

528
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,520
Where have you been?

529
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:21,520
I was wrong.

530
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,520
You didn't change your mind?

531
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,520
What?

532
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:36,520
I was wrong.

533
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:39,520
