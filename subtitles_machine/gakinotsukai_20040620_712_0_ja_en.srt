1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Good evening.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Good evening.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Good evening.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
When I first came out, I didn't think it was a good idea for a guest to be so excited.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I see.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Right?

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
When you come out and you're not in a good mood, it's better to invite a good guest.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
But today, it's just a guest who's not in a good mood.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Today, Hana-san, you seem to be in a good mood.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Why?

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
That's why I hear a lot of laughter.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
That's not true.

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Maybe your wife is sick or something.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
That's not true.

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
This program is brought to you by the following sponsors.

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I go to the toilet every now and then.

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
You go to the toilet every day.

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I go to the public toilet.

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I see it every now and then.

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm the only one who doesn't like it.

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
What?

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Thank you for always using it beautifully.

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Isn't that scary?

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
What do you mean?

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
It's scary, isn't it?

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
What do you mean?

27
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
You know that, don't you?

28
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
That's right.

29
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
That's right.

30
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
That means...

31
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
That means...

32
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
That means you should use it cleanly, right?

33
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
That's right.

34
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
But don't you think I should stop saying things like that?

35
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Why?

36
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
It's scary.

37
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,000
It's better to say, let's use it cleanly when it's dirty.

38
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Right?

39
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
You know that, don't you?

40
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
That's why you say things like that.

41
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
But I don't know if I should spill it.

42
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I don't know if I should spill it.

43
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
But when I suddenly say it, you say, I won't spill it.

44
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
That's why you say that.

45
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I won't spill it.

46
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
It's like your urine is coming out.

47
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
It's you.

48
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Who thought of that?

49
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
But if you don't do that, you won't know where your urine is.

50
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
There are a lot of people who say, is this where your urine is?

51
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
But I think that's scary.

52
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I don't know if I should say it, but it's scary.

53
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
It's like when a student is about to start studying for an exam,

54
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
you're being teased.

55
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
What?

56
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
You know that, don't you?

57
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Get out of here.

58
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I don't think that's good.

59
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
But I think that way of writing it has decreased a lot.

60
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
It has decreased, right?

61
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I think so.

62
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
But there was something else.

63
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
When I put up a sign saying, thank you for your cooperation,

64
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
it really decreased the amount of time.

65
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Is that so?

66
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
In reality, it hasn't decreased that much.

67
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I haven't been arrested.

68
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
What do you mean by that?

69
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Did you buy Boudin today?

70
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I don't care.

71
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
You're going to be a nuisance.

72
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I don't care.

73
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Don't you want to go home?

74
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
It's not the time to be doing this.

75
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Hurry up and write down your memory.

76
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Why are you so surprised?

77
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I was really surprised.

78
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
You're going to be like this forever.

79
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
There are a lot of people like that.

80
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
It's hard to talk.

81
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
So even though you haven't been arrested,

82
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
it has decreased by saying that.

83
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I think you should stop thinking like that.

84
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Why?

85
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
It feels like a bad time has come.

86
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
It has come.

87
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Speaking of a bad time...

88
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
What?

89
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,000
You said something like that.

90
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
The other day...

91
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
It's totally fine,

92
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
but Okama was arrested.

93
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Okama was hit by a car.

94
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Of course.

95
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
He was like,

96
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I'm finally coming out.

97
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
You're a fool.

98
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I'm glad it was a big car,

99
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
but it wasn't a big hit.

100
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
It was a small hit.

101
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I thought it was a big hit.

102
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I got out of the car.

103
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I'm not in my teens.

104
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I'm not in my teens.

105
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I'm not in my teens.

106
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
The person who was hit was an old man.

107
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
He was a little older than my dad.

108
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
He was over 70.

109
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
It's totally fine,

110
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
but he didn't apologize at all.

111
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I see.

112
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
It's fine.

113
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
There's no one older than my dad

114
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
who's like this.

115
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I was like,

116
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Are you okay?

117
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
He was like,

118
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Did you get hit?

119
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I said,

120
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I got hit,

121
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
but it's a little cracked.

122
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,000
The tail wasn't cracked.

123
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I said,

124
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I see.

125
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Why?

126
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Why?

127
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I said,

128
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Listen carefully.

129
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
My ears are weird.

130
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I thought he was apologizing.

131
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
No matter how many times I open it,

132
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I can't hear anything.

133
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
If it's my car,

134
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
it's fine.

135
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I'm fine with it.

136
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
But it's a big car,

137
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
so I can't say it's okay.

138
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I said something like that.

139
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I see.

140
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I said,

141
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Is that so?

142
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I said,

143
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
What?

144
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I've been thinking about it for a long time.

145
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
What?

146
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
What?

147
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Why don't you apologize?

148
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Why don't you apologize?

149
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I had a job.

150
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I was on my way to Kiyotashi.

151
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I had a job.

152
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
There was a recording.

153
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I think my face is sticking out.

154
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Don't say things you don't need to say.

155
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I said,

156
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Is there anything in that neighborhood?

157
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
There is.

158
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
It's over there.

159
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I said,

160
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Is there anything in that neighborhood?

161
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I said,

162
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
No, it's not.

163
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
It's a different place.

164
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I said,

165
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Is that so?

166
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
My house was right there.

167
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
It was right there.

168
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I see.

169
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I said,

170
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
This is my house.

171
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I said,

172
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I got a license.

173
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I said,

174
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I can't give you that.

175
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I said,

176
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Is that so?

177
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Is that so?

178
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
But I haven't apologized yet.

179
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I haven't apologized yet.

180
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I said,

181
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I'll go home and get a copy.

182
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I see.

183
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
That's fine.

184
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I said,

185
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Are you serious?

186
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
That's fine.

187
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I was laughing.

188
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I was laughing.

189
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I stopped my car.

190
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I was waiting.

191
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
He was going faster than I thought.

192
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
He was going faster than I thought.

193
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I said,

194
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I don't understand.

195
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
He was going faster than I thought.

196
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I said,

197
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I'm sorry.

198
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I said,

199
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I got a copy.

200
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I was thinking it was weird when he ran away,

201
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
But when I got the copy, I said,

202
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I'm sorry.

203
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Why?

204
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I wanted to go to the end of the world without saying sorry.

205
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I said sorry at the end.

206
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I thought,

207
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
That's right.

208
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
It's hard.

209
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
But even if you say that,

210
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
There was a mess.

211
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
After that?

212
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
If there was a mess,

213
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
When I gave the car to the trucker,

214
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
He hit me like this.

215
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
But I'm old, so if I can't do much,

216
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I won't do anything for him.

217
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
If there was a mess,

218
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
After that, there was a mess.

219
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
It's definitely a lie.

220
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
It's true.

221
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I don't know if he meant to apologize.

222
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I see.

223
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I don't know if he meant to say hello,

224
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
But sometimes he doesn't.

225
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
What?

226
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
He always says,

227
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Good morning.

228
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
But you ignore him.

229
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Hey!

230
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
You ignore him like this.

231
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Hey, am I an idiot?

232
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
What?

233
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
What is this?

234
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
You decided not to say hello when you were born,

235
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
So maybe that's why.

236
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Hey,

237
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
You're going to do that again, right?

238
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
That's right.

239
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
The showdown.

240
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
You haven't decided what to do yet, right?

241
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Yes.

242
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I'm not a regular,

243
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
But I have a little kid.

244
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
You have a little kid?

245
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
He's a trash comedian.

246
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
He has a can, a bottle, and plastic.

247
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I'll call him.

248
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Go ahead.

249
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Thank you.

250
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Thank you.

251
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
It's a big deal,

252
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
But it's not a big deal that the audience is excited.

253
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
It was a big deal.

254
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
We're here to watch the showdown.

255
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
What did we do last time?

256
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Bowling.

257
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Bowling?

258
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Yes.

259
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
This kind of bowling.

260
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I didn't know it was that old.

261
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
It was a year ago.

262
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
It was a long time ago.

263
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
What are we going to do next?

264
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
What are we going to do next?

265
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I don't think so,

266
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
But why don't we have Yamanagi do it by himself?

267
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
That's a good idea.

268
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
That's not the power of a downtown kid.

269
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I want to do it by myself.

270
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
It's been 98 years.

271
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
The two of us,

272
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Matsumoto, Kogoriko, and Hoka.

273
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I don't care about the others.

274
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I don't care about the others.

275
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Kogoriko, Hoka.

276
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
You're always in it.

277
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
That's what all the news reporters do.

278
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Lose, lose, lose.

279
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Lose, lose, lose.

280
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Three wins, three losses.

281
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Tanaka, you're going to have a baby.

282
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I want to have a family, but I'm lonely.

283
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Don't say you're lonely.

284
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I'm having a lot of fun.

285
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I don't care about the team.

286
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I don't care about what we're going to do.

287
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
At school,

288
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I asked him if he was interested in a flying box.

289
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Yama?

290
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
He said he could fly a kite.

291
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
You mean this height?

292
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I can fly a kite.

293
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
You mean you can fly this height?

294
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Yes, I can fly a kite.

295
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
So you want to fly a kite now?

296
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
That's right.

297
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I'll try to fly a kite at school.

298
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I'll try to fly it on stage.

299
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Let's fly it.

300
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
What do you want me to do with the kite?

301
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
You can do it with your hands.

302
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Do I have to do it like this?

303
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Or do I have to do it like this?

304
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
You can do it with your hands.

305
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Are you sure?

306
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
You don't have to jump and fly like this.

307
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
You can do it with your hands.

308
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Like this?

309
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
That's right.

310
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
It's okay.

311
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I'm sorry, but I'm going to ask you something.

312
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
You don't have to laugh.

313
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
This time.

314
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I said I wanted you to laugh.

315
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
If you can do it, it'll be fun.

316
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
It'll be fun.

317
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Don't be scared.

318
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I'll do it like this.

319
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Go over there a little more.

320
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Which way?

321
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
That way.

322
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
There's only one way.

323
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
There's only one way.

324
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
There's a lot of ways.

325
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Which way?

326
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Can I take it off?

327
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
It was easier earlier.

328
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
It's better to make your body lighter.

329
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
It doesn't change much.

330
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Do you want me to take it off here?

331
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Take it off.

332
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Take it off?

333
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
All of it?

334
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Can you do it?

335
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
You don't have a microphone?

336
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
If you have a microphone, it's okay.

337
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
It's okay?

338
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I don't want to talk about such important comments.

339
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Catch it.

340
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Catch it.

341
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Put it on your neck.

342
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Put it on your neck.

343
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
What are you doing?

344
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Why are you putting it on your neck?

345
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Wait a minute.

346
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Why are you putting it on your neck?

347
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Why are you putting it on your neck?

348
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Why did you take it off before that?

349
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I want to do it like this.

350
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Like this.

351
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
It's changed a lot from the beginning.

352
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
It's changed a lot.

353
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
It's changed a lot from the beginning.

354
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Mayonnaise.

355
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Mayonnaise.

356
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Mayonnaise.

357
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Mayonnaise.

358
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
It's better to go this way.

359
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
It's better to go this way.

360
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Be careful.

361
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
It's dangerous over here.

362
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
You should look over there.

363
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
It's okay.

364
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
It's okay.

365
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
It's impossible.

366
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
It's okay.

367
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
You're just trying to show yourself.

368
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
You're like a downtown servant.

369
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
You first said that.

370
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
It's okay.

371
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
It's okay.

372
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
It could be that

373
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I'm going to jump and go all the way over there.

374
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I'm going to go there and really burn myself.

375
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Where? Where do you want to go?

376
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
When you get to the sign...

377
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
The burger place.

378
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
The burger place.

379
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
This burger.

380
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
It's a monster.

381
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
That's right.

382
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I'm just going to watch.

383
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I'm scared to go down because I don't have any legs.

384
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
About 90% of the customers are getting tired of it.

385
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I feel like this one is more of an obstacle than this one.

386
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
It's okay.

387
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
This one?

388
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Yes.

389
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
When you jump.

390
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
When you jump.

391
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I see.

392
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I think that one is harder to open.

393
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I think that one is harder to open.

394
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
What are you doing?

395
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Kitty-chan!

396
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
What are you doing?

397
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Kitty-chan!

398
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I'm going to start now.

399
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Just one thing.

400
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
What?

401
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I'm sorry.

402
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
What?

403
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
What?

404
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
What?

405
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
What?

406
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
You're so scary.

407
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I knew it after I saw the underwear.

408
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
When did you...

409
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I'm really going to start now.

410
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I'm really going to start now.

411
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I'm surprised.

412
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
What kind of lie is that?

413
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I wanted to say something like that.

414
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I wanted to say something like that.

415
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I wanted to say something like that.

416
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
You're all so good at making up things.

417
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
You're all so good at making up things.

418
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I'm sorry.

419
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
You didn't open it.

420
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
What do you want to do?

421
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
What do you want to do?

422
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Please write it down in the manuscript.

423
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
First of all...

424
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
What did you want to do?

425
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
What did you want to do?

426
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Let's end it here.

427
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Who's going to solve it?

428
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I still have a lot to decide.

429
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I still have a lot to decide.

430
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
That's right.

431
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Basically, I'll do it like this.

432
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
When the audience comes out and asks what the fight is,

433
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I'll take off your underwear.

434
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Why?

435
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
The order is...

436
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Do you want to do it?

437
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Do you want to do it?

438
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
If we go in order, it's the order in which Mr. Hamagawa loses.

439
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
If we go in order, it's the order in which Mr. Hamagawa loses.

440
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
It's like this.

441
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
It's three by three.

442
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
It's like this.

443
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
If it goes by flow.

444
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
If it goes by flow.

445
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Then, if I go normally, I'm the only one.

446
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
That's right.

447
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
That's right.

448
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
That's right.

449
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
That's all right.

450
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
That's all right.

451
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I don't feel like losing.

452
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
But when I said it last time,

453
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Koko Riko and the other people said they wanted to go there.

454
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I went there with this person's intention.

455
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Koko Riko and the other people said that?

456
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
That's right.

457
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
It's hard to say, isn't it?

458
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
It's hard to say, isn't it?

459
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Actually, don't you want to join my team?

460
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Hmm...

461
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
No, no, no.

462
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
No, no, no.

463
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
No, no, no.

464
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
That's a strange development.

465
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Why?

466
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,000
This time, how about we split into S and M?

467
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
S and M.

468
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
If that's the case...

469
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
If that's the case...

470
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
If that's the case...

471
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
It's completely like this.

472
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Me too.

473
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
This is a half-hearted thing.

474
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
No, I'm also M.

475
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I'm also M.

476
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Naya-san, you're saying M-like.

477
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I'm also M-like.

478
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
No, I'm also M-like.

479
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Then...

480
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I'm also M.

481
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Ah, Tanato is S.

482
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Tanato is S.

483
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I'm S, unexpectedly.

484
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
It's S, isn't it?

485
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
S and M.

486
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Are we going to lose?

487
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
What kind of game is this?

488
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
What kind of game is this?

489
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Tanaka's S is interesting.

490
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I won't stop.

491
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I won't stop.

492
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Even if I look at it, I can't go up any further.

493
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Even if I look at it, I can't go up any further.

494
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Can I see it once?

495
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Oh, sure.

496
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Even if you can, I'll do it.

497
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Even if you can, I'll do it.

498
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Okay.

499
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
With Guppa...

500
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Yes.

501
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Ah, isn't there something like this?

502
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Isn't there something like this?

503
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
No, this is...

504
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
No, no, this is important.

505
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
It's important.

506
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
This is important.

507
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Why?

508
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Eh?

509
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Matsumoto-san and Hamada-san, please break up.

510
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Ah, Dada-san.

511
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
That's right.

512
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
That's right.

513
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Don't say such things.

514
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
No, no, it's okay.

515
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
It's okay.

516
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
It's okay.

517
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
It's okay.

518
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Then Hamada and I will break up.

519
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Yes.

520
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Then Guppa and I will break up.

521
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Ah, is that okay?

522
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Yes, yes, yes.

523
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Then we'll do it.

524
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Yes, let's do it.

525
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Then we'll do it.

526
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Then we'll do it.

527
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Why are you breaking up with me?

528
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Eh?

529
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Then Guppa and I will break up.

530
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Then Guppa and I will break up.

531
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Ah, no, it's not like that.

532
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Then Matsumoto-san, you can decide individually.

533
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Then, I don't know what you're talking about.

534
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
You don't know?

535
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
You don't know?

536
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
You don't know anything?

537
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
You don't know anything?

538
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
You don't know anything?

539
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Then, let's all imitate the rabbit.

540
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Why are you imitating me?

541
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
It's different.

542
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Then Hamada and I will break up.

543
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Then you guys don't know, right?

544
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
You don't see it.

545
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Ah, you don't see it.

546
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Yes, yes, yes.

547
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
That's right.

548
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
You don't see it.

549
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Yes.

550
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
That's the meaning of it.

551
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
That's the meaning of it.

552
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Yes.

553
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
That's the meaning of it.

554
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Yes.

555
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Yes.

556
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Yes.

557
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
That's fine.

558
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Yes.

559
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Then Gu or Pa?

560
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Yes.

561
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
One, two...

562
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Pa.

563
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Gu.

564
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Pa.

565
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Gu.

566
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
It's that kind of thing.

567
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
That's the possibility?

568
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
It's that kind of thing, right?

569
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
The three of you are going to decide on Gu or Pa?

570
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
You're going to convey it, right?

571
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
You're going to convey it, right?

572
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
You don't know the explanation, right?

573
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
You don't know the explanation, right?

574
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
I'll tell you what.

575
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
I don't know.

576
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Dann, everyone, let's imitate a chicken.

577
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Gu, you should give me one.

578
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Well, then, we'll try that again.

579
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
You'll give it again?

580
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Here you go.

581
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Are you ready?

582
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Yes, I'm ready.

583
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Ready, set, go!

584
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Ah, then it's me!

585
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Isn't that fine?

586
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
But before that, I'd like to come over here.

587
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
A leader like this...

588
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
The teamwork is...

589
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

590
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
No, it's not like that.

591
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Our feelings are...

592
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
No, why don't you understand?

593
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
You understand, don't you?

594
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Of course I understand!

595
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Koudan is Koudan.

596
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
You don't need anyone else?

597
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Eh?

598
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
No, that's right.

599
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:54,000
If the two of you really want this guy, then we'll go, right?

600
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
It's a deal.

601
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
It's a deal.

602
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:02,000
If you say something like that, it'll be like Dondoko Yamaguchi.

603
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Why did this member become a regular?

604
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Because of what happened now.

605
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Because of what happened now, right?

606
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Let's decide again, right?

607
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Yes.

608
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
What should we do?

609
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Let's decide what to do first.

610
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
For now, we'll do what we have to do.

611
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Yes, please.

612
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
This is hard. I really don't like this.

613
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
It's a penalty.

614
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
I really don't like the inn type.

615
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
I really don't like the inn type.

616
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
I really don't like the inn type.

617
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
If you say that, I really don't like the Onigoko family.

618
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
I really don't like the Onigoko family.

619
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
I really don't like the Onigoko family.

620
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
But there's a rumor that you'll do it for 48 hours.

621
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
I really don't like it.

622
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
I really don't like it.

623
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
I really don't like it.

624
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
I can't do it anymore.

625
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
How many years has it been?

626
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
I'm already old.

627
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
I'm old, so I'll just go.

628
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
I'm still young, right?

629
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I'm already sick of being a new member, so my butt is still so big.

630
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
It's Ado-chan's butt.

631
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
It's not like that.

632
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
It's Ado-chan's butt.

633
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Hey!

634
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
This summer, the confrontation again.

635
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:24,000
This program was provided by the following sponsors.
