1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Chiki-chiki! Newlyweds, hoya-hoya!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Kotori Director, Sakamoto Prefecture!

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Otaku Homo!

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Sakamoto-san!

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
He's right behind me.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Yes, yes.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
He tricked me and told me he finished work early today.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Chiki-chiki! Newlyweds, hoya-hoya!

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I'm a newlyweds, hoya-hoya.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
You're probably eating, aren't you?

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I see.

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
What would you do if you were?

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
That would be interesting.

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Shall we bring the presents?

16
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Yes, yes, yes.

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
If you speak too loud...

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Yes, yes, yes.

19
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
It's there, isn't it?

20
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
It's there.

21
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Shall we go?

22
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Let's go!

23
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Newlyweds, hoya-hoya!

24
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Newlyweds, hoya-hoya!

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Yes?

26
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Excuse me, my name is Hamada.

27
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Yes.

28
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Do you have a husband?

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Yes, I do.

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Thank you for waiting.

31
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Yes, thank you.

32
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Good evening.

33
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Good evening.

34
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I'm eating.

35
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Please come quickly.

36
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Good evening.

37
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Congratulations.

38
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Thank you.

39
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Zakao is eating in his dirty jersey.

40
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
He's tidying up nicely.

41
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
It's a nice room.

42
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
He's in a good mood.

43
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Wait a minute.

44
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
What are you doing?

45
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Nawa and Eriko...

46
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
What?

47
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Kitsuta!

48
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Kitsuta!

49
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Nawa and Eriko's home.

50
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
What is that?

51
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
First of all, they say they love each other.

52
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
That's terrible.

53
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
They eat together.

54
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
You can't cheat on them.

55
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Kitsuta!

56
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
It stinks.

57
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
You're starting to stink.

58
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Did you know?

59
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
What?

60
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
A little.

61
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
She knew a little.

62
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
It's rude not to know.

63
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Sano, what's this?

64
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Sano likes birds.

65
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Sano likes birds.

66
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
It's cute.

67
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Buy it for her.

68
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
A little more.

69
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Wait a minute.

70
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Nawa and Eriko's home.

71
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
What is this?

72
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I don't like it either.

73
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Fly.

74
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:41,000
It's here, isn't it?

75
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
That's great.

76
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
It's already stuck.

77
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I'm going to clean up the penguins.

78
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I hate it.

79
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
In this room.

80
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I've had enough.

81
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
It stinks.

82
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Not only the penguins.

83
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
We have a special guest today.

84
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Please welcome today's special guest.

85
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
It's Mr. Kaoru Sugita.

86
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Nice to meet you.

87
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Please sing a bird song.

88
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
It hurts.

89
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I wanted to laugh.

90
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Sing together.

91
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Everyone looked happy.

92
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I'm sorry.

93
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Don't mess with me.

94
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
If my heart is the sky.

95
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I'm sure it's a pure white bird.

96
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Birds, birds, birds.

97
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Please sing this song.

98
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
A bird song.

99
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Thank you very much.

100
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Thank you very much.

101
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
You don't have to do that.

102
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Thank you very much for coming to sing this song.

103
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
It's not a big deal to hear it live.

104
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Birds, birds, birds.

105
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Birds, birds, birds.

106
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
It's over.

107
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
It was hard.

108
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
What was that?

109
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Do you have a nickname?

110
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
A loser.

111
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:09,000
For example, how much money did you lose and how much money did you get back?

112
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
How much money did you get back?

113
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
What?

114
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
You're really dirty.

115
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Why?

116
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I'm desperate.

117
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Listen to me.

118
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Do you think money is dirty?

119
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Of course.

120
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:36,000
In the end, I put my wallet in here and put money in here.

121
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
That's why I lost it.

122
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:43,000
If I don't lose it, I'll put it in here.

123
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
That's disgusting.

124
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
No, no, no.

125
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
It's a mystery.

126
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I don't carry a wallet.

127
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I don't carry a wallet.

128
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I've never seen you carry a bag.

129
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I've never seen you carry a bag.

130
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I don't carry it at the end.

131
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
That's great.

132
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I'll leave it to you.

133
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Who do you leave it to?

134
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I don't have any more fruits.

135
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I'll eat an apple.

136
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
It's after the war.

137
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I don't carry it.

138
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,000
How can you live without money?

139
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I don't carry it.

140
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
What are you going to do when you want to buy gasoline?

141
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:49,000
That's why...

142
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I heard something good.

143
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
What's that?

144
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Close it.

145
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I think about it in my heart.

146
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I think about my body.

147
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
When you become a talent, you don't spend much money.

148
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I don't spend much money.

149
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I don't know how many celebrities are there.

150
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
What are you doing?

151
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
You!

152
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
You!

153
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Don't make a fuss.

154
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
You!

155
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Say it.

156
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
You!

157
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
What do you want to say?

158
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
You are the most common talent in Japan.

159
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Don't make a fuss.

160
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
You haven't changed.

161
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
You don't drive a car.

162
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I don't drive a car.

163
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Everyone says my car is good.

164
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Take a used car.

165
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
It costs about 500,000 yen.

166
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
That's not true.

167
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Think about the time you earned money.

168
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
That's not true.

169
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I didn't do much in Osaka.

170
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I didn't sell it, so I had money.

171
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I didn't sell it, so I had money.

172
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I didn't sell it.

173
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
400 million?

174
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Give me this.

175
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Don!

176
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I hate money.

177
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
This is true.

178
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Why is there money?

179
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I'm from Kurizakaya, so I don't need it.

180
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
What I want to say is that I dropped my wallet again a little while ago.

181
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
That's your fault. Because you're a doji.

182
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I dropped a lot of money on the Shinkansen.

183
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
It's a license, right?

184
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
There's about 200,000 yen in my wallet.

185
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Please!

186
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
200,000 yen?

187
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
200,000 yen?

188
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
What's that?

189
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
There's 200,000 yen in it?

190
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
There's about 200,000 yen in it.

191
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
You're a king of money.

192
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Well, 200,000 yen is fine, but...

193
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
200,000 yen is fine?

194
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Well, well, well...

195
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Well, it's not that big of a deal.

196
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
You didn't change your license, did you?

197
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
No, I asked him what he dropped on the Shinkansen.

198
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
This time, I found it at Hakata.

199
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
There was no money in it?

200
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
No, there was money in it.

201
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
There was money in it?

202
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
There was money in it.

203
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
There's no such thing.

204
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I dropped 200,000 yen on the Shinkansen.

205
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I don't know if I'll ever find it again.

206
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I was so depressed.

207
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I said, it's not a big deal.

208
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I felt like I was going to lose my head.

209
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I see.

210
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I finished my work in Osaka.

211
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I realized I didn't have a wallet.

212
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I was going to get a fan letter from a fan.

213
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I looked at it.

214
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
There's 10,000 yen in it.

215
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Yeah.

216
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
There's no such thing.

217
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
What is that?

218
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I thought there was a fan who dropped 10,000 yen when I dropped the money.

219
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
That's amazing.

220
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Isn't it?

221
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I thought it was a good deal.

222
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I don't have any money right now.

223
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I see.

224
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I thought that 10,000 yen was valuable.

225
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I opened it and looked at it.

226
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
There was a 1 yen coin on the cello table and 10,000 yen on the side.

227
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Damn it!

228
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
It's not a damn thing.

229
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I didn't do anything.

230
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I couldn't laugh at this customer.

231
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I've been robbed of tens of thousands of yen in the dressing room.

232
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
There are many people in the dressing room.

233
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Let's stop doing that.

234
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
But...

235
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I went to the scene and found a bag.

236
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I saw the wallet.

237
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I didn't think, huh?

238
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
No, no, no.

239
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I'll never do that.

240
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I'm sure I have that sense of justice.

241
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I'll be a politician.

242
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I'll be a politician.

243
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I'll bring in a lot of money.

244
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I'll bring in a lot of money.

245
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I can't do that.

246
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I can't do that.

247
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
My opinion will never change.

248
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I'm a man like that.

249
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I'll believe it.

250
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Are you kidding me?

251
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
What is that?

252
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I don't understand how a man like that can do that.

253
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I don't understand how a man like that can do that.

254
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
But I thought everyone felt that way.

255
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
You're a great man.

256
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Can't everyone change their opinion?

257
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Can't everyone change their opinion?

258
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Can't you?

259
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
It's easy for me.

260
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
You can do it right away.

261
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I don't usually do that.

262
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I don't usually do that.

263
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I don't usually do that.

264
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I don't usually do that.

265
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I don't usually do that.

266
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
That's how I feel.

267
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Why?

268
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I don't like that kind of example.

269
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Why?

270
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Can you eat it if it's Nanbo?

271
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
What is that?

272
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I'm a human being.

273
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I don't understand who you are.

274
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I don't understand who you are.

275
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I don't understand who you are.

276
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I'd like a bowl of tea for kids.

277
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,000
A bowl of tea for Sailor Moon.

278
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Do you have a hot spring?

279
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Yes, I have a hot spring.

280
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
How many do you want?

281
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I know you're curious about it.

282
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
How many do you want?

283
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
You're talking about what I said.

284
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Can you do it with 100 million yen?

285
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Can you do it with 100 million yen?

286
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
That's behind the man

287
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Behind the man?

288
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Can you do it with 100 million yen?

289
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
100 million yen right?

290
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Behind the man right?

291
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Behind the man is mine

292
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
It's a little lucky

293
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I'll eat it

294
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
You'll eat it? I won't eat it

295
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
You'll know if you have 100 million yen

296
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Everyone will eat it right?

297
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Everyone will eat it right?

298
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
It'll come

299
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I'll eat it

300
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
If you have 100 million yen it'll definitely come

301
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
There's no harm to the body right?

302
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
There's no harm to the body

303
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Is that so?

304
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
There's no harm to the body

305
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I ate it and it came out of my butt

306
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I thought it was just you eating it

307
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Just eating it?

308
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
It's not that simple

309
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
It came out like this and it came out like this

310
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
It's Alpha

311
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
There's this thing in America

312
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
It's like a shocking movie

313
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
It's interesting when you get hit

314
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
It's not interesting

315
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
But if you get hit like in the movies

316
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
You can't do it like this

317
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Is that so?

318
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
The moment you get hit

319
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
It's like

320
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
It's like

321
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Really?

322
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
That doesn't hit

323
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
That doesn't hit

324
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
You'll get hit in the stomach

325
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
What are you doing?

326
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Did you just add that?

327
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Did you just add that?

328
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
It's true

329
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
No no

330
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
That smell

331
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Wait a minute

332
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
That movement is a little different

333
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Please hit me a little

334
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Stop it

335
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
It's a little different

336
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
You get hit once but you don't stand up

337
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
And then you go like this

338
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
You're lying

339
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
It's not like that

340
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
What is this?

341
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I got hit

342
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
If it's a joke, it hurts

343
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
That doesn't hit

344
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
There's a lot of blood

345
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Are you serious?

346
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
This is a lie

347
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
It's not like that

348
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
It's going up

349
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I don't know

350
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
What are you reading?

351
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I don't know

352
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I'm going to write a letter

353
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Please write a letter

354
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I was reading at the convenience store

355
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
It suddenly got dark

356
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
It's scary

357
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I screamed

358
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
After a while

359
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I said, excuse me

360
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I turned on the light

361
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
There was a show in the back

362
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Everyone who was walking outside came together

363
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
That's right

364
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I was standing in front of the book

365
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Before that

366
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
You have money, right?

367
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Buy it

368
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
It's hundreds of yen

369
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Don't say that

370
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Buy it

371
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
You have hundreds and thousands of yen a month

372
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
What were you looking at?

373
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
You

374
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Were you looking at an aerotopia again?

375
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I'm very curious about something

376
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
What is it?

377
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Your lips look thinner than they used to be

378
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
No way

379
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
From your eyes to your lips

380
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
That's not true

381
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
What do you think of looking at Mr. Hamada in front of you?

382
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
That's not true

383
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
How do you do that?

384
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Your lips

385
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
What are these seams?

386
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Why?

387
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I'm scared

388
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Where are the seams?

389
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I can't tell from the camera

390
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
There are no seams

391
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
It's like a Matsuri

392
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
That's not how you do it

393
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Did you hear that?

394
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Do you know how to do that?

395
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Are you doing it?

396
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
No

397
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Are you not doing it?

398
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
We are always together

399
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Have I ever said that to you?

400
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
No

401
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
No

402
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
I remember

403
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
If you do that, you have to wear a bandage for a while

404
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
What are you talking about?

405
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,000
You have to wear a bandage for a while

406
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
That's when you push your teeth

407
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
That's how you do it

408
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I'm scared

409
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
That's when you push your front teeth

410
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
When you were wearing a bandage

411
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Your front teeth were broken

412
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
I broke my front teeth

413
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I broke them

414
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
When did you change them?

415
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
That's not true

416
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Stop it

417
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
You've always had this kind of mouth

418
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I used to have a thicker mouth

419
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
This is true

420
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
I used to have a bluer face

421
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
My mouth was always open

422
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
If you look at me from the side

423
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
What are you talking about?

424
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
What are you talking about?

425
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
All my family members

426
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
What?

427
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
You're rude

428
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
I'm just saying that the air is thin

429
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
My mouth is always open

430
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
My wife and three children take a bath together

431
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I have a question

432
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Why is there a hole in the middle of the bath chair?

433
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Isn't that for hot water?

434
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
What are you looking at?

435
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
You're trying to get hot water through

436
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
What are you looking at?

437
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
What are you looking at?

438
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
That's why there's a hole in the middle

439
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
You can sit and take a bath

440
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
But the water will fill up

441
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Hello?

442
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
The water is flowing

443
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
You can sit normally

444
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
I'm telling you that the water is flowing

445
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I'll tell you

446
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
It's dangerous for a child to take a bath alone

447
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
So by making a hole in the chair

448
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
What do you call it?

449
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
With that chair

450
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
With the hole

451
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Let's try not to fall and get in

452
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
If we get bigger than this hole

453
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Shou-chan, let's get in

454
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Is that what you mean?

455
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:26,000
It's a hole
