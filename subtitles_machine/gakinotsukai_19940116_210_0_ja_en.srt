1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
It's a new partner.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
The next guest is Yamazaki Hetare, Taiman Gohan Shogun.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I can't accept it at all.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Of course you can't.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
This corner is also the second time.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Usually it ends with the first time, but it's the second time.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Yamazaki-kun.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I can't accept it at all.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Of course you can't.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
This corner is also the second time.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Usually it ends with the first time, but it's the second time.

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Usually it ends with the first time, but it's the second time.

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Usually it ends with the first time, but it's the second time.

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Yamazaki-kun.

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Let's welcome Yamazaki-kun.

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Yamazaki-kun, please.

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Last year, I was really angry because I was called Hetare Hetare.

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:59,000
This year, I would like to make the most of my experience as a middle school student and do my best.

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I would like to be the best in the entertainment world.

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Thank you.

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Today is also the fifth game.

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
OK.

23
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Last time, you almost lost.

24
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Yes.

25
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
How about this time?

26
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
This time, I will win three games and two losses.

27
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I will definitely win.

28
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
You still can't win three games and two losses.

29
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Yes.

30
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Your eyes are small.

31
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Hey!

32
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Mr. Matsumoto.

33
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Yes.

34
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I'm from here.

35
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I see.

36
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Are you ready?

37
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The first game is Honogata.

38
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Please.

39
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Honogata.

40
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Let's get started.

41
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Thank you.

42
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
The first game.

43
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
What are you doing?

44
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Hey, stop it.

45
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Stop it for the time being.

46
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Please give me the judgment.

47
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
This is...

48
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
This is a battle, Mr. Yamazaki.

49
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Please stop it for the time being.

50
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Cheers.

51
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I lost to an eight-year-old.

52
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
If you put all together, I would have lost.

53
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
At this age.

54
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
The second game is Honogata.

55
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Please.

56
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:50,000
The first game is Honogata.

57
00:02:50,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Please give me the judgment.

58
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Wait a minute, Mr. Yamazaki.

59
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
What's wrong?

60
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Are you injured, Mr. Yamazaki?

61
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Are you okay, Mr. Yamazaki?

62
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I can't do it today.

63
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Let's get started.

64
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
The third game.

65
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Please.

66
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:45,000
The fourth game is Honogata.

67
00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Please.

68
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:23,000
The fifth game is Honogata.

69
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Please.

70
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Thank you very much.

71
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Thank you very much.

72
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Please tell me your name.

73
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I'm Tokyo Boys.

74
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Tokyo Boys.

75
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
You don't move at all.

76
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I don't know how to fight.

77
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
You didn't get in the way at all.

78
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I didn't get in the way.

79
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I think it was a very good story.

80
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Don't say that.

81
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
The fourth game.

82
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Please.

83
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:03,000
The fifth game is Honogata.

84
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Please.

85
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Usagi-chan.

86
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I've already decided.

87
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Go, go, go.

88
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Go, go, go.

89
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Go, go, go.

90
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I'm answering.

91
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I was caught.

92
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Yamazaki is going to be eliminated.

93
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
It's my dad, Yamazaki.

94
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Do you want to go further?

95
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Do you want to go further?

96
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Yamazaki, are you okay?

97
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Can you stand up?

98
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
What is this guy?

99
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Wait a minute.

100
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Who are you?

101
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Yamazaki, are you okay?

102
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Yamazaki, are you okay?

103
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
It hurts.

104
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
It's out.

105
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Hirakawa is out.

106
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Yamazaki, are you okay?

107
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
What is this?

108
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Look, look, look.

109
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Yamazaki-san.

110
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Hirakawa won.

111
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Yamazaki-san.

112
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
No matter who wins, I'll lose.

113
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Even if you win, it's the same as last time.

114
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
That's right.

115
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
But, Yamazaki-san.

116
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Yes.

117
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
This is the last game.

118
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Yes.

119
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Let's win this.

120
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I'll definitely win.

121
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Yes.

122
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
The last one is this guy.

123
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Please.

124
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
The last one.

125
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Ready.

126
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Hey.

127
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Yamazaki, are you okay?

128
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
What are you doing?

129
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
You can't come out.

130
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Really.

131
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Wait a minute.

132
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Yamazaki-san.

133
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Wait a minute.

134
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Are you okay?

135
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I can't play anymore.

136
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
My blood is connected.

137
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Wait.

138
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Dad wins.

139
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Dad, nice to meet you.

140
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Nice to meet you.

141
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Long time no see.

142
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Yes.

143
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I think you have the personality of a parent and child.

144
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
That's right.

145
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I think you have that.

146
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Sit down.

147
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Dad, long time no see.

148
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Thank you.

149
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
You have the personality of a parent and child.

150
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
You're eating, aren't you?

151
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Yes, I'm eating.

152
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I'm doing my best.

153
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Take enough money.

154
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Yes.

155
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Thank you.

156
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Were you okay earlier?

157
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Earlier?

158
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I had a little fight.

159
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
You have the personality of a parent and child.

160
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I was a little angry.

161
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
You have the personality of a parent and child.

162
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I'm usually angry.

163
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I don't appear much in Osaka.

164
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
That's right.

165
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I'm popular here.

166
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Yamazaki-san.

167
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
First of all, this game.

168
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Yes.

169
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
We lost five times in a row.

170
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
We lost five times in a row.

171
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
We all lost.

172
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Yes.

173
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Who was the most stubborn of the five?

174
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
My dad.

175
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
As an extra, today's killer account.

176
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Dad's confrontation.

177
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
No, no, no.

178
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I'm sorry.

179
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I'm sorry.

180
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I'm sorry.

181
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I'm sorry.

182
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Ladies and gentlemen.

183
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I've been cheering for you many times over the years.

184
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Yes.

185
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
This is the first time this year.

186
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
It's the first time.

187
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
It's the first time.

188
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,000
There's a foreigner.

189
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
His face is all red.

190
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
He's shy.

191
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
He's shy.

192
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
That's great.

193
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
If you look at him from the stage.

194
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I don't know what to say.

195
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Well, well, well.

196
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Foreigners.

197
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Everyone thinks we're down-to-earth.

198
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Foreigners think we're down-to-earth.

199
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
You're persistent.

200
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Yes, I am.

201
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I don't know.

202
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Down-to-earth.

203
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Well, it's the first time this year.

204
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Well, if I look at the TV.

205
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
It's cool.

206
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
What is it?

207
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
After all, the talent is different.

208
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Mr. Kagura gave it to me.

209
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
What are you doing?

210
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
What is this?

211
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Your chest is growing.

212
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
No, it's not.

213
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Don't do that.

214
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Your chest is growing.

215
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
What's your chest?

216
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I don't like it.

217
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
After all, that's not good.

218
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
That's a talent.

219
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Hawaii is a status.

220
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
But everyone.

221
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I have a question.

222
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Why do you go to Hawaii with a talent?

223
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Don't you go to Hawaii?

224
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I'm talking about you.

225
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Why don't you go to Hawaii?

226
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Why are you going to Hawaii?

227
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Why do you go to Hawaii?

228
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
It's cold in Japan, so I went to a warm place.

229
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
It doesn't matter if you don't go to Hawaii.

230
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Why do you go to Hawaii?

231
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I want to go on New Year's Day.

232
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Why?

233
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I want to go on New Year's Day.

234
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
This year, you left your wife and child.

235
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Yes.

236
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
That's cool.

237
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Why do you go to Hawaii?

238
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Your wife is beautiful.

239
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Your wife is beautiful.

240
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
You are a brandy knight.

241
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Don't do something you don't understand.

242
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
You are a brandy knight of your heart.

243
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I don't understand.

244
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I don't understand your heart.

245
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I don't understand you.

246
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I was on the news yesterday.

247
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I went on a trip to Hawaii.

248
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I went somewhere for 9800 yen.

249
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I did it.

250
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
It was limited to a few people.

251
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I'm a fool.

252
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Why?

253
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
It's cold, but there are so many people lined up.

254
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
There are only 200 people lined up.

255
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
It was a lottery.

256
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
There are only 200 people lined up.

257
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
There are only 200 people lined up.

258
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
It was a lottery.

259
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
That's right.

260
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
What are you talking about?

261
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Don't be so cute.

262
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Don't do that.

263
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Who is it?

264
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Don't do that.

265
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Don't do that.

266
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Don't do that.

267
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I'm sorry.

268
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I'm sorry.

269
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
It was cold.

270
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Don't say it's cold.

271
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
It's cold.

272
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I don't understand.

273
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
What is it?

274
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I went home.

275
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I came home.

276
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I sat in front of my house.

277
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I was packing my luggage.

278
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
That's cool.

279
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I was just packing my luggage.

280
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I did this.

281
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I did this.

282
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I was packing my luggage.

283
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Hey!

284
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
You are a pervert.

285
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I was packing my luggage.

286
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Why?

287
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
The reason why I don't like going abroad is...

288
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I don't like Messi.

289
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
No.

290
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:04,000
When you arrive at the country, you are the only one who gets caught when you get a passport.

291
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I get caught.

292
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
It's embarrassing.

293
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
It's embarrassing.

294
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
It's embarrassing.

295
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
It's embarrassing.

296
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:14,000
When you arrive at the country, you are the only one who gets caught when you get a passport.

297
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Why did you do that?

298
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I've been doing that for a long time.

299
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I always wear the same clothes.

300
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
It's embarrassing.

301
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I'll kick you this year.

302
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
It's embarrassing.

303
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
It takes a long time.

304
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I'm always like this.

305
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I think too much.

306
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:42,000
When people stare at me, I get nervous.

307
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
When I get nervous, I think there is something.

308
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I get nervous.

309
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I get nervous.

310
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I get nervous.

311
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I wear glasses vertically.

312
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I get nervous.

313
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
They think I'm strange.

314
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Don't you bring anything home?

315
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
No.

316
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I ask you.

317
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
There is nothing.

318
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Are you nervous?

319
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I get nervous.

320
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I don't know why, but I get nervous.

321
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:24,000
To be honest, at the end of the year, my friend came to Fuji.

322
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I was crying at that time.

323
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I wasn't crying.

324
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I was crying.

325
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I was crying.

326
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I didn't cry.

327
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I didn't cry.

328
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I didn't cry.

329
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I get nervous.

330
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I'm not moved at all.

331
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I don't know why.

332
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I want to ask you.

333
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Is that so?

334
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I don't like it.

335
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I don't like it.

336
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I drink alcohol.

337
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I drink alcohol in the plane.

338
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I can sleep.

339
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I don't drink alcohol.

340
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I don't know why.

341
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
The next is a man.

342
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
He's stupid.

343
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
He looks like this.

344
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
He's close to me.

345
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
He's close to me.

346
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
He's a strange man.

347
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
He looks like such a person.

348
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
He may be my friend.

349
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
He's close to me.

350
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
He's close to me.

351
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
He's old.

352
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,000
How many times do you want to say that?

353
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
That's really bad.

354
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
But, that's right.

355
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,000
The overseas record debut.

356
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Sakamoto, the world's Sakamoto Produce.

357
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Sakamoto Ryuichi.

358
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
It's okay. It's out.

359
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
It seems so.

360
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
It's okay. It's out.

361
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
The rest is just blowing in.

362
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
But, Sakamoto Ryuichi is going to New York right now.

363
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
That's right.

364
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
What are you going to do in New York?

365
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
That's why I don't like airplanes anymore.

366
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Sakamoto, the world's Sakamoto.

367
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Come on.

368
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Why?

369
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
That's bad.

370
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
That's what you said.

371
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
You said you were going to debut overseas.

372
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Either way, you have to go once.

373
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
You said it.

374
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Why?

375
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
It doesn't matter if it's a debut song.

376
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
How many times have you sung in Japan?

377
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Idiot.

378
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
You sang in Japan and made a CD and sent it overseas.

379
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
It doesn't matter.

380
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
After all, the debut is in that country.

381
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
What?

382
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I have to do a debut concert.

383
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
But, if it sells, you can go.

384
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Even if it doesn't sell, I'll go.

385
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Just the recording.

386
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Sakamoto Ryuichi, come on.

387
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Record in Japan for the time being.

388
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
It's better in Japan.

389
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
That's rude.

390
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Why?

391
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
For the time being, you said it.

392
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
You said you were going to debut overseas.

393
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
It takes 12 hours to get to New York.

394
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
12 hours.

395
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
That's right.

396
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:13,000
How many eggs can you bake?

397
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,000
No, that's not possible.

398
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
That's for amateurs.

399
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
No, really.

400
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
It doesn't matter.

401
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
What?

402
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Do you want to go?

403
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
It's not that I want to go.

404
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
They told me it was a good place.

405
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Yes, they told me.

406
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I don't know what to do.

407
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I'm not good at New York.

408
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,000
You're lying.

409
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I came here because I had a bad experience in New York.

410
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
It doesn't matter.

411
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,000
What?

412
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
It doesn't matter.

413
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
That's what it is.

414
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
That's right.

415
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
You lost.

416
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
What?

417
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
The White House.

418
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
You lost.

419
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Shiro won.

420
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
That's a general opinion.

421
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
You said it on TV.

422
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Shiro lost to my appearance.

423
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Your appearance?

424
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
My appearance.

425
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
But you can't.

426
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Did you decide the winner?

427
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Really.

428
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
It's a difficult story.

429
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I have to play a penalty game.

430
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I don't know if I'm going to New York.

431
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I decided to make my debut in the United States.

432
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Your debut in the United States.

433
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
It's amazing.

434
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I still can't reach you.

435
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Even if you want to come, come to Kanagawa.

436
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Hatsune Shogun's down turn.

437
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
It's a big reaction.

438
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Shut up.

439
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
What is this?

440
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
This is a great invention.

441
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I don't hate this.

442
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
That's right.

443
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Don't be angry.

444
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Can you move properly?

445
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I won.

446
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
You're laughing.

447
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
When I see this, I can't help but laugh.

448
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Why are you always angry?

449
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I don't know.

450
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
What are you dissatisfied with?

451
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Why are you angry?

452
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
That's right.

453
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I'm shooting a drama.

454
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,000
When we started, it was over.

455
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
I was shooting in the next studio.

456
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
There was still a location left.

457
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
The studio was the last.

458
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,000
The staff came together.

459
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I said, thank you.

460
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
The producer hit me.

461
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Why?

462
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
The producer kicked me.

463
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Why?

464
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
The producer kicked me.

465
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
You shouldn't do that.

466
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
You shouldn't do that.

467
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
I was told not to do that.

468
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Who told you that?

469
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Why?

470
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
There was still a location left.

471
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Why are you angry?

472
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
I just said thank you.

473
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
I just said that.

474
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
There was still a location left.

475
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
The shooting was over.

476
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Why are you angry?

477
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Why are you angry?

478
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Why are you angry?

479
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
This is amazing.

480
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Why are you angry?

481
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Why are you angry?

482
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
The story has changed again.

483
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
I don't care.

484
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I don't care.

485
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I don't care.

486
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
I don't want to work with him again.

487
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:13,000
I heard on TV.

488
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
There is a talent.

489
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
He has a lemon.

490
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
He is the only one who doesn't have a lemon.

491
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Who was it?

492
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
I didn't have a lemon.

493
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Who was it?

494
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
There were two people.

495
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Who are you?

496
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
There were two people.

497
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Who are you?

498
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
When I came here.

499
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
I was bored.

500
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
I said please.

501
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I said okay.

502
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
You said okay.

503
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
I was dressed up.

504
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Excuse me.

505
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
The lemon...

506
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
What?

507
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
What?

508
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I don't know what it is.

509
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
I don't have a lemon.

510
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I have a different image.

511
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
You said such a long line.

512
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
I didn't have a shower.

513
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I didn't have a lemon.

514
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
When I took a break.

515
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,000
I was interested in a lemon.

516
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,000
I thought it would be cool to have a lemon.

517
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Bang! Bang!

518
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Bang!

519
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
It seems to be delicious.

520
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
It seems to be delicious.

521
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Why do you hit me?

522
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Are you strong?

523
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
I was beaten by the other side.

524
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
I was bad at it.

525
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
I was beaten.

526
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
I was beaten.

527
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
I was beaten.

528
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
I was beaten.

529
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Hey.

530
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
I think you are a Fanta.

531
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
I think you are a Fanta.

532
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Really?

533
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Really?

534
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
I think you are a Fanta.

535
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:58,000
I'm a Fanta.
