1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Next time, at Gaki no Tsukai, Chiki Chiki! Yamasaki Happy Project!

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
The real me is interesting!

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Matsumoto-san, I don't understand the meaning.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I don't understand the meaning.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
It's just that, Gaki no Tsukai, let's do our best with the four of us.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Yamaguchi-san also dropped it.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
He dropped it?

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
It can't be helped.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Oh, it came out! A genius comedian!

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
A genius comedian came out!

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
That means there's only one.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Hamada-san also said it, but I don't really understand today's meaning.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
To be honest, I talked about it with one person before.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
At that time, the reputation was pretty bad.

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
First of all, Adachi's...

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
If you sympathize with me, give me money!

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Don't get cold!

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
You're a weirdo too!

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
He raised his own lack of talent and ran away from the stage.

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Yamazaki wanted to make his image worse because he worked as a comedian.

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I've been in the industry for a long time, and I'm getting less and less work.

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Seriously!

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm not kidding.

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
My image is pretty bad.

25
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I've been thinking about a lot of things to improve my image today.

26
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
A genius comedian appears!

27
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I'm not kidding!

28
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
This program is provided by the sponsor you see.

29
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Basically, I'm going to have a big party with you guys.

30
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I'm going to have a big party with you guys.

31
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Everyone, please stand me up.

32
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
What do you mean?

33
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
So, for example, there are times when you give me an interesting answer.

34
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I'll decide the answer to that question.

35
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
You're going to say something like this?

36
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Yes.

37
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
You're going to say something like this?

38
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I'm going to do a rehearsal and decide everything.

39
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Only the people I like are coming today.

40
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Only the people I like?

41
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
The people I like...

42
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
The people who like me.

43
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
What are you doing?

44
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
It's an image-up strategy.

45
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Why don't we cooperate?

46
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
We're definitely going to slip, aren't we?

47
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
We're definitely going to slip.

48
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I don't want to do that.

49
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
You can't do that if you're laughed at?

50
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I won't do that.

51
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Really?

52
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Let's do a rehearsal.

53
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Everyone is so excited.

54
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
But...

55
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
In the end, he was forced to do it.

56
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
He couldn't accept it, so he went to the rehearsal where Yamazaki was acting.

57
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
You're saying a rehearsal in a big way.

58
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Mr. Matsumoto is number one.

59
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Mr. Matsumoto is number one.

60
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Tanaka is number two.

61
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
En is number three.

62
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
All of them are in the house.

63
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Well, well, well.

64
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Are you going to be in this order?

65
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Yes.

66
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
And this is the clothes.

67
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
What do you mean?

68
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Everyone, this is the moss green one.

69
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
It's plain.

70
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
It's a color that's hard to understand.

71
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
It's plain.

72
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Is that pink you?

73
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Yes, it's me.

74
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I'm a little pink.

75
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Do you all wear the same color?

76
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
The same color.

77
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
There's a flower.

78
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
There's a flower.

79
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Let's start with a head greeting.

80
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
You don't have your own opinion, do you?

81
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
No, I don't have my own opinion.

82
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Excuse me, this is Mr. Hamada's comment.

83
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
This isn't a comment.

84
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
You can't say this.

85
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
No, I can't.

86
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Please say that.

87
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Yes, I'll do it.

88
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Bokuchin.

89
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Mr. Matsumoto, when you say something, it's bokuchin.

90
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
All the time.

91
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
When you're talking about yourself.

92
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Bokuchin.

93
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Bokuchin recently learned how to cook.

94
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
He wanted to make a hot dog.

95
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,000
He warmed up the dog.

96
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
This is Mr. Matsumoto.

97
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Yes.

98
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Next.

99
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
The other day, I was walking around town.

100
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
There was a very sexy vehicle running.

101
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Wow, it's a train.

102
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
You're always frowning.

103
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I'm always frowning?

104
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
You're always frowning.

105
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
It's very embarrassing.

106
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
You're very nervous.

107
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Just a little bit.

108
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
A little bit?

109
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Why?

110
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Why?

111
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Why?

112
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I'm always looking down.

113
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Look down.

114
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
You're very excited.

115
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I'm very excited?

116
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Hello, turtle.

117
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Last Friday, I had a job in Osaka.

118
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I'm Endo Shouzo.

119
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Really?

120
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Why?

121
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Why?

122
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Am I very excited?

123
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Yes, you're very excited.

124
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
You're full of confidence.

125
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Really?

126
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Yes.

127
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
And then...

128
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Yes.

129
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I'm a comedian.

130
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I don't get angry at all.

131
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Even if I'm handed over, I'm in trouble.

132
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Hey, wait.

133
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I'm your junior.

134
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I've always wanted to say this.

135
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I've always wanted to say this.

136
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
And then I say,

137
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Wow, here it comes.

138
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Hirokawa Yakushibara.

139
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
And then...

140
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
And then...

141
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
And then...

142
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
And then Hamada-san's...

143
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Which one?

144
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Are you a genius?

145
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Are you a genius?

146
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
And then...

147
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Are you a genius?

148
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Hit him hard.

149
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Are you a genius?

150
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
And then...

151
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
And then...

152
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
And then...

153
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I'm a genius.

154
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I'm a genius.

155
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I don't want to do this.

156
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I don't want to do this.

157
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I don't want to do this.

158
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I don't want to do this.

159
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,000
What is the funny story that Arnold Schwarzenegger said?

160
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
What is the funny story that Shuga-chan said?

161
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Can you think about this for a moment?

162
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Yes.

163
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Hmm...

164
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I can't eat anymore.

165
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I'm speaking Japanese.

166
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I'm a foreigner.

167
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I'm speaking Japanese.

168
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I'm speaking Japanese.

169
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
What is the funny story that Arnold Schwarzenegger said?

170
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I put my butt out in Terminator 1.

171
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I'll say that in the show.

172
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
What?

173
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Even if you don't stop me, what is this?

174
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
What I'm talking about right now...

175
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
You all think about it.

176
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
What I'm talking about right now...

177
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Are you lying?

178
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I'm not lying.

179
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Isn't that Matsumoto-san?

180
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I'm not lying.

181
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,400
Isn't that the answer to Matsumoto's answer?

182
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,200
It's not a bag!

183
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,000
It's not a bag?

184
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:49,800
It's not a bag.

185
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,300
It's a document.

186
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,200
That's a document.

187
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,100
I'll say this in the actual show.

188
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:54,700
A reference document.

189
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:55,700
A reference document.

190
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:59,700
But Yamazaki-san, if you don't get any, it's over with just one, right?

191
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:00,500
That's right.

192
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,100
Then, I'll end it with this one.

193
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:02,800
This.

194
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,100
I can't eat anymore.

195
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,500
This is Matsumoto-san.

196
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,100
Wait a minute.

197
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,900
Wait a minute.

198
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,000
This is Matsumoto-san.

199
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:11,800
I can't eat anymore.

200
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,600
I see.

201
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,100
Yes.

202
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,700
What's the funny thing that Shua-chan said?

203
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:18,400
Why don't you look it up on P.E.A.R.?

204
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,000
This is a bit funny.

205
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,900
Should I say that?

206
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,300
Shua-chan must have heard it.

207
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,700
Probably, from someone.

208
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:28,300
What about you, Do-san?

209
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:29,600
No, I'll take it.

210
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,400
Huh? You'll take it?

211
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,200
Yeah.

212
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,500
Huh? I don't have anything to say, right?

213
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,700
Yeah.

214
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,500
You're on vacation this time.

215
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,600
Vacation?

216
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,500
What do you mean, vacation?

217
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,900
Tanaka only says it once.

218
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:44,200
No, Tanaka doesn't say it once.

219
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:48,600
The viewers either cut it out or couldn't eat it.

220
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,300
What are you talking about?

221
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:51,200
Wait a minute.

222
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,800
I can't eat anymore.

223
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,000
I can't eat anymore.

224
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,200
Matsumoto-san's answer is

225
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:58,600
Yamazaki's idea of a vacation tomorrow.

226
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,400
Endo's answer is

227
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,800
to see if we can see this.

228
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,000
And the delicious Yamazaki,

229
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,100
Hama-chan's answer is

230
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,600
BAM!

231
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,200
After the BAM!

232
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,100
What do you want me to say?

233
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,300
Um...

234
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:16,400
Don't apply to the world.

235
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,300
I was a little scared at that time.

236
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:21,900
It's like a home.

237
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:24,900
Even if you put on an atmosphere,

238
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,300
Even if you put on an atmosphere,

239
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:27,100
You're not here anymore?

240
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,500
I'm not here anymore.

241
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,200
The moment you sit down,

242
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,600
It's fun.

243
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,000
The moment you sit down,

244
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,400
It's fun.

245
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,800
Say it again.

246
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:41,400
Say it again.

247
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,400
Say it again.

248
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,300
It's fun.

249
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:45,200
Say it again.

250
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,100
Say it again.

251
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,600
Say it again.

252
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,400
I love you.

253
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,800
I don't really understand the meaning.

254
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,200
It's dangerous.

255
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,600
Everyone's watching TV.

256
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,500
It's okay.

257
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,600
It's okay.

258
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,900
I love you.

259
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,600
I said it again.

260
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,800
I love you.

261
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:11,000
I said it again.

262
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:16,000
What is the last word of the person who fell into the bath?

263
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,700
Matsumoto-san's last word is

264
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:27,200
Help me.

265
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,600
Tanaka's last word is

266
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,200
Kyah!

267
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,200
Kyah?

268
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:36,200
It's your first time saying that.

269
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,200
It's your first time saying that.

270
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:43,600
You're hot.

271
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,200
I'm...

272
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,600
This is the last one.

273
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,800
Yamazaki-san's last word is

274
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,000
I'm melting.

275
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:51,400
And then,

276
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:59,600
I'm melting.

277
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:04,300
The last is a rehearsal of a joke using things.

278
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:06,100
Matsumoto-san.

279
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:06,700
Please.

280
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,000
What is it?

281
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,600
With a file.

282
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,300
Hello.

283
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:15,500
Use a file.

284
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:18,200
If you don't say anything, just go.

285
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:18,800
It's cold.

286
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,900
Sorry.

287
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:21,300
It's cold.

288
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:22,400
If you don't say anything, just go.

289
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:22,900
It's cold.

290
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:23,400
It's cold.

291
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,800
Sorry.

292
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,700
You say, too.

293
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,200
Say, too.

294
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,000
Say, too.

295
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,300
But I can't hear it at all.

296
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,500
What?

297
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,500
I can't hear it at all.

298
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:35,300
You can't hear it at all, but you're using a file?

299
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:36,500
I'm...

300
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,200
I'm resting.

301
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,300
Are you still thinking about it here?

302
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:43,600
But, in a sense, it's fine.

303
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,000
I want to do that, too.

304
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,100
Just go.

305
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,600
If you take this with you, your legs will...

306
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,600
You have a good one.

307
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,300
And then,

308
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:57,600
Yamazaki's enthusiastic fans fill up the venue.

309
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:02,500
Yamazaki Image Up's big strategy is in the second half of the show.

310
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:06,000
Ladies and gentlemen.

311
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,200
I have some sad news.

312
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,000
What is it?

313
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,200
I'm sorry to disturb your excitement.

314
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:26,100
Today's opening is almost 20 minutes long.

315
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:30,100
The talk section is 5 or 6 minutes long.

316
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:32,900
I don't give a shit.

317
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:37,700
The closing time is about 5 minutes.

318
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,000
I'll take it back.

319
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,200
What a voice.

320
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:47,000
I don't give a shit.

321
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,600
I was so angry last night.

322
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,400
About what?

323
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:52,600
You didn't do the laundry, did you?

324
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,200
By myself?

325
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:53,800
Yeah.

326
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:54,400
I didn't.

327
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,000
You didn't, did you?

328
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,300
You didn't, so I couldn't tell.

329
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:58,200
I was so angry.

330
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,000
Why?

331
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
You did the laundry, didn't you?

332
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,500
Of course, I'll do it myself.

333
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,700
No, no.

334
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:08,900
I'm serious.

335
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:11,600
I don't care, but you're so energetic.

336
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,600
Who are you talking to?

337
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,200
Who are you talking to?

338
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:22,200
I'm going to take it out of the dryer.

339
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,800
What the hell is that?

340
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:30,000
Your underwear is upside down.

341
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,400
Do you understand?

342
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,800
You did that before you put it in the dryer?

343
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,800
No, I don't like that.

344
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,000
I always take it out when I take it out.

345
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,400
I do it gently.

346
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:47,100
I always do it, but when I take it out of the dryer, it's upside down.

347
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:50,600
5 out of 6 are upside down.

348
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:54,800
Your shirt is upside down, too.

349
00:12:54,800 --> 00:13:00,200
What do you think about that?

350
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,600
It turns when I wash it.

351
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,400
It does.

352
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,000
It turns like this.

353
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,600
Your underwear and shirt are upside down?

354
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,600
It's upside down at that point.

355
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:12,100
It's okay if it's upside down, but why is it upside down again?

356
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:14,700
Why does it end upside down at the end?

357
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:17,400
I don't know.

358
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:22,000
I thought you were wearing pajamas in the dark, but you were wearing it upside down.

359
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:28,400
I thought you were wearing it upside down, but you were wearing it upside down.

360
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,900
Mr. Matsumoto, you can imitate anything.

361
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:35,600
Please imitate the next three people who threw a spoon at the croquette.

362
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,200
The croquette threw a spoon.

363
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,900
Are you ready?

364
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:44,500
Akira Takarada

365
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,300
Can you do it?

366
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,000
Yes, I can.

367
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Please do it.

368
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,200
Akira Takarada

369
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:57,800
There are a lot of people who run away in the cold, but I hate it, so I'll do it from the beginning.

370
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:03,100
But before that, I'd like to ask Keisuke Kuwata.

371
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,400
Wait a minute.

372
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,600
What does that have to do with anything?

373
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:10,000
It's not like I can do this.

374
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,100
Okay.

375
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:24,000
I hate it. I hate it. I hate it.

376
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,200
Thank you.

377
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:29,200
This is the main subject.

378
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:33,600
Akira Takarada, Koro Inagaki, and Mr. Okada.

379
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,300
Please do it.

380
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:38,100
Before we do this, I'd like to ask Keisuke Kuwata.

381
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,600
Stop it!

382
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,400
Listen to me first.

383
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,300
I can't do it.

384
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:43,400
You can't do it?

385
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,200
I can't do it.

386
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,100
Wow, that's cool.

387
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:50,400
Do you think you can do it?

388
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,600
I'll teach you.

389
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,100
Keisuke Kuwata, you're a lovely person who stays in my heart.

390
00:14:55,100 --> 00:15:03,700
I don't know how to say it.

391
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,100
Sing first.

392
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:16,700
It's number two.

393
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:18,200
What do you mean by number two?

394
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:21,300
I'm number one, so I'm number two.

395
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:24,000
Is that okay?

396
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,100
In the entertainment world,

397
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:30,400
you gather a lot of impersonators and you're number one and number two.

398
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,600
Number two?

399
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:42,600
What about number one?

400
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,000
I'm number one.

401
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,300
You're number one is the point, isn't it?

402
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:47,000
Is that so?

403
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,200
Let's do it.

404
00:15:48,200 --> 00:16:02,500
I'll teach you again.

405
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:06,700
You're number one, aren't you?

406
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:23,900
Let's do it.

407
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:26,900
Let's introduce ourselves one by one.

408
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:29,600
First, next to me.

409
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,900
I recently learned how to cook.

410
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:39,100
I wanted to make a hot dog, so I warmed up a dog.

411
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,500
What is it?

412
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,900
My name is Hitoshi Matsumoto.

413
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,200
Nice to meet you.

414
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,300
Next.

415
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:48,800
Recently, when I was walking around town,

416
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,400
I saw a very sexy vehicle running.

417
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:55,500
Wow, it's a train.

418
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,900
What is it?

419
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:00,900
My name is Naoki Tanaka.

420
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:02,200
Next.

421
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:06,200
Hello, turtle, turtle.

422
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,700
I had a job in Osaka last Friday.

423
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:10,100
My name is Shogo Endo.

424
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:12,400
Why is that?

425
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,700
Nice to meet you.

426
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:14,700
Last one.

427
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:25,700
Without laughing...

428
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:29,300
Without laughing, I'm in trouble.

429
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:30,700
Oh, here it is.

430
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:35,700
Yakujimaru Hiroko.

431
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:39,000
You're a genius, aren't you?

432
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,600
Nice answer.

433
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:51,100
Happy Kevin.

434
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,700
Next.

435
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:55,900
From now on, I'll give you a question.

436
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:59,000
There's a flip-flop in the back.

437
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,700
You'll write the answer on the flip-flop.

438
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:05,200
The person who gets it will be the winner.

439
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:09,600
The first question is this.

440
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:13,600
What is the funny story that Arnold Schwarzenegger told?

441
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,800
Raise your hand if you got it.

442
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:16,800
Okay.

443
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:17,800
Okay, Matsumoto.

444
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:21,600
What is the funny story that Shiwa-chan told?

445
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,800
I can't eat it anymore.

446
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,900
Why?

447
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,400
Next.

448
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,300
Okay.

449
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:28,100
End.

450
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:30,600
Okay.

451
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:35,700
Can't you see this flip-flop?

452
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:38,400
Next.

453
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,200
Okay.

454
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,200
Okay, Matsumoto.

455
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,600
What is the funny story that Shiwa-chan told?

456
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,800
Tomorrow is a long trip. I'm happy.

457
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:47,700
Why?

458
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:48,900
Okay.

459
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:50,400
Yamazaki-san.

460
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,500
What is the funny story that Shiwa-chan told?

461
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,900
Okay.

462
00:18:54,900 --> 00:19:02,400
I got my ass kicked by Terminator 1.

463
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,300
Yamazaki-san.

464
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:06,500
You'll be famous all over the world.

465
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:09,400
I got it.

466
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,700
I'm scared.

467
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,800
Next.

468
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,000
You don't have any?

469
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,300
I'll go now.

470
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:20,900
Okay.

471
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:24,200
What is the funny story that Shiwa-chan told?

472
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:30,600
You should look it up on PIA.

473
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:39,500
I'll get excited if I'm with you.

474
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,900
It's funny. Let's do it again.

475
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:42,900
Again?

476
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,000
Again?

477
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,700
Again?

478
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:50,300
You're crying, aren't you?

479
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:53,300
The next topic is this.

480
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:58,200
What is the last word of the person who fell into the water?

481
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,800
Okay, Matsumoto.

482
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:03,900
The last word of the person who fell into the water.

483
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,600
Help me.

484
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,000
Why?

485
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:08,900
Okay, next.

486
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:09,400
Okay.

487
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,600
Oh, Tanaka.

488
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:16,100
What is the last word of the person who fell into the water?

489
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,200
Why?

490
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,900
That's not a good way to say it.

491
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:28,100
It's not?

492
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:30,100
You shouldn't have said that.

493
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:33,100
It's a waste of time.

494
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:36,100
Okay, end.

495
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:39,400
What is the last word of the person who fell into the water?

496
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,300
It's hot.

497
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:43,700
Why?

498
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,200
Okay.

499
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:49,900
Okay, Matsumoto.

500
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:52,900
What is the last word of the person who fell into the water?

501
00:20:52,900 --> 00:21:00,800
I'll melt.

502
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:06,400
I wish you were my partner.

503
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:14,400
Who's going to say the pun?

504
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,900
As you can see, I've prepared a lot of things behind me.

505
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:21,300
Please say the pun using those things.

506
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:22,900
Okay, let's do it.

507
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:29,800
Okay, I'll say it.

508
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,200
Okay, Yamazaki-san.

509
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:35,400
I'll say it using IREBA.

510
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,700
I'm awake.

511
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:45,300
No, IREBA is over there.

512
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,200
You're good.

513
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,400
I'm counting on you for the big laughter party in Japan.

514
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,100
The big laughter party.

515
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:52,300
Okay.

516
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:53,400
Matsumoto-san.

517
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,400
I'll use a file.

518
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,600
Use a file.

519
00:21:55,600 --> 00:22:01,700
Give me a file.

520
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:05,800
I'll use a file.
