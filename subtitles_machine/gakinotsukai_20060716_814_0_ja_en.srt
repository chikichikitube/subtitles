1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
That man comes to the studio before the recording.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Good morning.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Good morning.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Good morning.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Good morning.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Good morning.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Hello.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Good morning.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
What's up?

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Well...

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I bought the format of the program the other day.

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Thank you.

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
This?

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
It's popular abroad too.

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
But I heard that you don't really understand it.

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
No, it's not like that.

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Really?

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
The number of African TV stations is huge.

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
There are about 12.

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Then...

21
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
If it's 12, it's not that big.

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Last year in July,

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
When the ratings are high, they will be challenged to a quiz that Itao has proposed.

24
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
But the content of the quiz is something that the common people cannot understand.

25
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
And this time, what is the purpose of Itao's visit?

26
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
It's like a business trip.

27
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I don't think so.

28
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I don't think so.

29
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
It's a little before the actual performance.

30
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I know. I thought of a new format this time as well.

31
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
If you'd like, you can buy it.

32
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Then, please leave it to someone.

33
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
No, no.

34
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Please look at it.

35
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:36,000
There are songs, but I think it'll be more real if we actually play them.

36
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I was wondering about other songs, but I thought it'd be nice to have Nittere-san grow up and Nittere-san grow up to this point.

37
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I thought I could do it, so I came here in the rain.

38
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
What should I do?

39
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
What are you talking about?

40
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Let's go.

41
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Really?

42
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Yes.

43
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
It's a waste of time to talk about this.

44
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Let's go.

45
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I'll be waiting downstairs.

46
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Please.

47
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
What are you talking about?

48
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I can't say anything.

49
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
He's talking nonsense.

50
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I can't say anything.

51
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Tonight, gather in the holy hall and get the title of the true hero, using your own intelligence, strength and courage.

52
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Come on, heroes!

53
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
The first battle of the first series

54
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
The first battle of the first series

55
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Heroes, are you ready?

56
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
From now on, you will face many difficulties

57
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
But, after you overcome them, you will get Heaven

58
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
When you get 1000 Heavens

59
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
1000 Heavens?

60
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
The title of the true hero

61
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:34,000
You will get a pendant and a prize of 1 million yen.

62
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Do your best.

63
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
What should I do?

64
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I do it every time.

65
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Just listen to me.

66
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Let's go to the first stage.

67
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Heaven's Road.

68
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:52,000
The Heavens Road is prepared here.

69
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
This road is very narrow and unstable.

70
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
You have to cross this road within a minute.

71
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Please get the Itzy Stone in the treasure chest.

72
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
It's a good thing to see.

73
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
On the way, the violent gladiator will cover your path.

74
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
If you succeed, you will get 200 Heavens.

75
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Now, the hero, Hamada!

76
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Let's start the game!

77
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
You have one minute to limit your time.

78
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Within that time, you can try again and again.

79
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Ah, I see.

80
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Heaven's Road, 3 o'clock!

81
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Start!

82
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I think I can get 200 points.

83
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Scary!

84
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Scary, scary.

85
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
This is impossible!

86
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
This is impossible!

87
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

88
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Time is running out.

89
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Be brave.

90
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Time is running out.

91
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
You are not doing it.

92
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
It's too fast.

93
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
It's too much.

94
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Go, go, go.

95
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Wow!

96
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Wow!

97
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Wow!

98
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Mr. Endo, you have obtained 200 Heavens by hunting for treasure.

99
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,000
What is this?

100
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
It looks cooler when you take it out.

101
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Right?

102
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Mr. Endo, you have obtained 200 Heavens.

103
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Wow!

104
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
You are so surprised.

105
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
You are falling.

106
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Heaven is so surprised.

107
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
200 is a bit too much.

108
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Everyone's.

109
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Everyone's Heaven?

110
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Yes, everyone's Heaven.

111
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Please do your best to reach 1000 Heavens.

112
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
There's 200.

113
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
There's no more 200.

114
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
There's no more 200.

115
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
There's a key, but it's open.

116
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Now, let's move on to the next stage.

117
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
This is Heaven's Balloon.

118
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:09,000
As you can see, the Yomegraduator is now fully charged and is sleeping.

119
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:19,000
If you can break these three balloons without causing the Yomegraduator to wake up, you will get two Heavens.

120
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Now, who will be the hero?

121
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I don't want to do this.

122
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I don't want to do this.

123
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Hero, Ideo Yamazaki!

124
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
He's sleeping.

125
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
He ate a lot of ramen.

126
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
He ate 3 times.

127
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
He ate 3 times.

128
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Now, Heaven's Balloon, It's the start!

129
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,500
Start!

130
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,000
While he's sleeping.

131
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
While he's sleeping?

132
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Don't wake him up.

133
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
It's a dead end.

134
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Oh no!

135
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
His wife...

136
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
He's sleeping again.

137
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Oh no, he's sleeping again.

138
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
He looks really tired.

139
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
He looks really tired.

140
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
It's okay.

141
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
If he says he won't wake up now...

142
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
This is okay.

143
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
He's done with the second one.

144
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Oh, is this one awake?

145
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Oh, it's gone to sleep again.

146
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
This is the first time I've seen this.

147
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
It's the first time.

148
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
It's okay, it's okay.

149
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
There's only one balloon left.

150
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
If the wife doesn't wake up after this, it's clear.

151
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

152
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Oh, no.

153
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Oh, did you wake up?

154
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Oh, what a shame!

155
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
YomeGraduator, wake up!

156
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Heavens Over!

157
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
What a shame!

158
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
What's wrong with you?

159
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
That was a close call, but unfortunately,

160
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
he woke up with the second balloon.

161
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Yamazaki-san, Heavens over!

162
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Oops!

163
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
YomeGrad's battery is dead.

164
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Everyone, do you want to charge your batteries?

165
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Or not?

166
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Are you asking us?

167
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Can we decide?

168
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
But we're enemies, so it's better not to die.

169
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Then you can't get the 1000 Heavens either.

170
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Do you want to charge?

171
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Then I'll charge it!

172
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Okay, please take a look at the time limit while the wife is charging.

173
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Start charging!

174
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Tomato?

175
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Tomato, right?

176
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
That's the amount of charge.

177
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Oh, I see.

178
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
The charging has started.

179
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
What the hell is this?

180
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
It's almost full.

181
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Why didn't it come out at first?

182
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I didn't get any.

183
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
You got a similar one yesterday.

184
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I'm not satisfied yet.

185
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Oh, you're satisfied?

186
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Now, the charging is complete.

187
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Then, I'll take 20 Heben for charging.

188
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Are you going to take it?

189
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
It has nothing to do with charging.

190
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Yes.

191
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Why are we charging for a seat?

192
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Hey.

193
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Did you take too much?

194
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Hey.

195
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I took too much.

196
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
There are more than 20.

197
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
There are more than 20.

198
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
What are you doing?

199
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
You are overdoing it.

200
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
The charging is completed.

201
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:50,000
The next stage, the third stage is Heaven's Pant.

202
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
What is it?

203
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
You are taking it off.

204
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,500
Now, this stage is...

205
00:09:55,500 --> 00:10:00,000
You will be wearing the panties of the hero of the YomeGraduator.

206
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
You will pull the panties from yourself.

207
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
If the panties come off at the same time as the YomeGraduator,

208
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
you will get 200 Heaven.

209
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
The panties you will get are here.

210
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Now, then...

211
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
This raw panties,

212
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
for the rental fee, you will get 50 Heaven.

213
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I'm going to get it?

214
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
You're going to get that too?

215
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
50?

216
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Count properly, 50.

217
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
You don't look nervous.

218
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Shut up!

219
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
You took too much.

220
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I did.

221
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
There's nothing left.

222
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
There's nothing left.

223
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
You're too much.

224
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
50, go.

225
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
The game is over.

226
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Now it's the wife's choice.

227
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
If this sound is played, it will be the wife's choice.

228
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
The challenger will be the wife's gladiator.

229
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Now, the wife, go to selection.

230
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I haven't done it yet.

231
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Who will be chosen?

232
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
It's a selection.

233
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Sees!

234
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
No!

235
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Why?

236
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
The final decision is made.

237
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
No way!

238
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
It's a perfect match.

239
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
It's a perfect match for Yome.

240
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I don't like it.

241
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I don't like it!

242
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I don't like it.

243
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I don't like it.

244
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
What?

245
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
With Yome?

246
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
What?

247
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
You both wear the pants.

248
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
If you can take it off at the same time as your wife, you'll get Heaven.

249
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
What do you mean, same time?

250
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I don't know when my wife takes it off.

251
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Oh, I see.

252
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,000
You've been waiting for this, haven't you?

253
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Of course.

254
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Please set up your underwear.

255
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Set up your underwear.

256
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
What's that?

257
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:14,000
This is scary.

258
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Hama-san didn't lose.

259
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
It's tight.

260
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
It's torn.

261
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
It's torn.

262
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
It's no good.

263
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
It's no good.

264
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I can't show it.

265
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Let me show it.

266
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I can't show it.

267
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
It's a mess.

268
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
This is no good.

269
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
No matter what, I can't do this.

270
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
This is no good.

271
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Let's go!

272
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
The last one!

273
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
One more!

274
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Please look at this carefully!

275
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Yome!

276
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
If Yome can do the Panto at the same time as me...

277
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
This is a joke!

278
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Heaven is over!

279
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
No, no, no!

280
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
The one in the middle is out!

281
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
It's out!

282
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I don't know when I'll do this!

283
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Even if I get hit suddenly!

284
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,000
No pants matching! Heaven is over!

285
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
What is this?

286
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
It's a shame.

287
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Heaven!

288
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Thank you very much.

289
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
This is a bit of a shame.

290
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
This is a big deal.

291
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Please return to your seat.

292
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Oh, this sound is...

293
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
The previous winner of the ITSUJI KOROSIYAM, Yamazaki-san,

294
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
defeated the previous graduate,

295
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
and he has come to the stadium to revenge Yamazaki-san.

296
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
What?

297
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Yamazaki-san, it's dangerous.

298
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
It's scary.

299
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Yamazaki-san.

300
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:01,980
if you cover this sheepskin you will not be able to see your face from the Gladiator

301
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:04,180
that's not good

302
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:06,000
you should be covered

303
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
it's dangerous

304
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
he's getting closer

305
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
cover him

306
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
quickly

307
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,000
if you cover him you won't be able to see your face from the Gladiator

308
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Yamazaki

309
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
he's looking for him

310
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Yamazaki

311
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I can't see it now.

312
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
You're so scary.

313
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
You're so scary.

314
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Is he writing?

315
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
No, no.

316
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I can't see it but I can smell it.

317
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
You're so scary.

318
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I can't see it.

319
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
You're so scary.

320
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
You're so scary.

321
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I didn't notice it.

322
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
That's amazing.

323
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,000
He left without noticing Yamazaki-san.

324
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Yamazaki-san, I'm glad you didn't die.

325
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Now, I'll take the rent of the Itzy Mantle.

326
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I'll take it for 10 times.

327
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
What is this? It's really a lot.

328
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Count it.

329
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
10 times.

330
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
10 times.

331
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
It's 10 times.

332
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
It's 10 times.

333
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
It's like this.

334
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
It's a lot.

335
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
It's a lot.

336
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
That's all you got?

337
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Now that the training is over, let's move on to the next stage.

338
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
The final stage.

339
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Yome-san has crossed the line!

340
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Now, in this stage, Yome-Gladiator will dance to the music.

341
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:39,000
While the music is playing, you will dance along with it.

342
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
And, in order to not be noticed by Yome-Gladiator,

343
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
you will have to take the Itzy Stone next to you.

344
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Currently, everyone is just about 10 Heavens.

345
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
However, I am not a demon.

346
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:58,000
If you challenge the 10 Heavens all together,

347
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:03,000
if you succeed, you will be recognized as a true hero.

348
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Will you challenge the Heavens all together and overcome the Heavens?

349
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I don't understand the meaning.

350
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I want to do it.

351
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I will challenge it.

352
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Will you be okay with the Heavens?

353
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Yes, I can.

354
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
We've got a head-on.

355
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Now, everyone,

356
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Yome-san's It's G Start!

357
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Now, everyone, please dance.

358
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Please stand up while you're standing.

359
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Please refer to Yome's dance.

360
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Please take a look at the dance of the bride.

361
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Now, the song has stopped.

362
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Did you see it?

363
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Everyone is watching.

364
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Yes.

365
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Tanaka san, go to hell!

366
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Out!

367
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Out!

368
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Out?

369
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I don't understand.

370
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I don't understand at all.

371
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I think Tanaka san wasn't moving at all.

372
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Let's play the second song.

373
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
We have to dance the same song.

374
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Start!

375
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
But I don't understand.

376
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I can't do it with my hands.

377
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Please dance as much as you can.

378
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,000
When you turn around, it means that you are going to hell.

379
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
The song has stopped.

380
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Oh, he's faking it!

381
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
That's not fair!

382
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Oh, there's a whistle here. What could it be?

383
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Oh, it looks like Yamazaki-san got a red card.

384
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
It seems that the aggressive side was not enough.

385
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
He is out.

386
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
He is out.

387
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
He lacked the positivity.

388
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
He was drunk.

389
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Moreover, when will he get his will back?

390
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
He will not move forward.

391
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
When will he get his will back?

392
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
He has been with his wife all the time.

393
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
He is always moving sideways.

394
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Yamazaki-san, you can't participate in the next game.

395
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
The next song, start!

396
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I can do it.

397
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
You can do it.

398
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I can do it!

399
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I can do it!

400
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
You can do it!

401
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
This is...

402
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Oh, too hell no!

403
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
This is...

404
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
What the hell is this?

405
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I didn't move!

406
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Which one of you moved?

407
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I'm out!

408
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
If you had taken the stone just now, would it have been okay?

409
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
That's right!

410
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I don't know!

411
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
If you had taken it...

412
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
If you had taken it...

413
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
The stone slipped!

414
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
What's wrong?

415
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Hey, shut up!

416
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
How many times have I told you to do it before?

417
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Let's go. Let's start the next song.

418
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I'm not going to do it.

419
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
If you don't do it, you'll get fired.

420
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I'm not going to do it.

421
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Oh no!

422
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Yes.

423
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Mr.Takoyama, 5th place.

424
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Thank you.

425
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
It was close.

426
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
The hero, Mr.Matsumoto, is left alone.

427
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
I'm left alone.

428
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
It's hard.

429
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
No, no, no, let's do our best.

430
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Let's take it.

431
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Let's take it.

432
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Let's go.

433
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Let's go.

434
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
The next song, start.

435
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
It's good.

436
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
It's good.

437
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
It's good.

438
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
If you look at it from here, it's stupid.

439
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
It's good. It's good.

440
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
It's really cold.

441
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
It's cold. It's cold.

442
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
What is this?

443
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
What is this?

444
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I don't care! I lost!

445
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
It's long!

446
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
The song has stopped.

447
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
It's...

448
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
...Dest.

449
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Everyone has become go-to-hells.

450
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
What?

451
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
And so, the winner is...

452
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
The end of its G!

453
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
What's going on?

454
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
It's already been decided!

455
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
What's going on?

456
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
The winning number is...

457
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Zero Heaven!

458
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Unfortunately, it didn't reach 1000 Heaven.

459
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
And so, the winner is...

460
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Yome Graduator!

461
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Congratulations!

462
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Yomegura Theater

463
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:10,000
The award goes to the Yomegura Theater for the award of 1 million yen and the Itsuji pendant.

464
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Congratulations.

465
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
You threw it away.

466
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:23,000
So, Yome and Hitamu's Nekomaru Itsuji Colosseum.

467
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
See you next week.

468
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
No, no, no, no, no.

469
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
It's a mess.

470
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Thank you very much.

471
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Is that the end of the game?

472
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
What did you think about this game?

473
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,000
It's a game that you can get numbers.

474
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
I didn't understand the reason until the end.

475
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
I didn't understand until the end.

476
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
But it was very exciting.

477
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I don't think I can win.

478
00:22:51,000 --> 00:23:00,000
I think that if you watch it and think about the strategy, you will be able to win.

479
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Is that so?

480
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Of course it is.

481
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:10,000
But the TV show people don't know about it.

482
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,000
They don't know how to watch it.

483
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
I didn't have that idea.

484
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
That's the most important thing.

485
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Yamasaki vs. Moriman is finally decided!

486
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,000
The man who was stood on the cliff is the eternal rival, Shukuseki Moriman!

487
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Don't miss the shocking battle!

488
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
I brought the next man to the other side.
