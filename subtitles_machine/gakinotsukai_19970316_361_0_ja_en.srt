It's really bad

101
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
It's really bad

102
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
It hurts

103
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000

00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I don't know.

115
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
This is red.

116
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
This is cheap.

117
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I don't eat umeboshi.

118
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
This is red.

119
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Eat it quickly.

120
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I want to eat it quickly.

121
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:04,000
It's a voice for you.

123
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000

Start.

125
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:22,000
It's a celebration.

126
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Start.

127
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Let's see.

128
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I don't know if I can do it.

129
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:52,000
It's good.

130
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I can't lose.

131
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
You win.

132
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
OK.

133
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I can't do this.

134
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
We are very scared of blindfolds.

135
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I don't know.

136
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I'm very scared.

137
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
We are very scared of blindfolds.

138
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I'm very scared.

139
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
What should I do?

140
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Are you ready?

141
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Wait a minute.

142
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
This is for you.

143
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
No.

144
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Start.

145
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I'm very scared.

146
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I can't do this.

147
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,000
It hurts.

148
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
It hit the glass.

149
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I don't need that.

150
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
It's scary, so it doesn't hit the glass.

151
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Hold it.

152
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I can't do this.

153
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Let's finish this quickly.

154
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I don't know.

155
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Don't say that.

156
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I'm very angry.

157
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I really don't know.

158
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I'm very scared.

159
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
What?

160
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I'm very scared.

161
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
What are you scared of?

162
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Let's finish this quickly.

163
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I'm very scared.

164
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Let's finish this quickly.

165
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I can't do this.

166
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Let's finish this quickly.

167
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Wait a minute.

168
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Ready?

169
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Start.

170
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I can't do this.

171
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Let's finish this quickly.

172
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Ready?

173
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Start.

174
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
It hit the glass.

175
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:38,000
It hit the glass.

176
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
You should do it.

177
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
You should do it.

178
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Start.

179
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
It hurts.

180
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Can you leave me alone?

181
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Hamada lead.

182
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,000
It hurts.

183
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:08,000
It hurts.

184
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Oh my god.

185
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I get angry sometimes.

186
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Marathon.

187
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,000
You did a marathon on TV, right?

188
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I did it in Tokyo International Marathon.

189
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
You should do it.

190
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
You were driving a truck, right?

191
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
It was a marathon.

192
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Why didn't you drive outside?

193
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Why did you stop the car for that?

194
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Why didn't you stop the car for that?

195
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Don't you remember?

196
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I don't remember.

197
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
You should drive 42.195km, right?

198
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
That's right.

199
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
You should drive 42.195km, right?

200
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
You should drive 42.195km, right?

201
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
intelligent.

202
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
That's your fault.

203
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Don't you remember the Goro show?

204
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
You should do thecho-cho.

205
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Don't you remember the Goro show?

206
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:16,000
You should do thecho-cho.

207
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Your smile turns red.

208
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Your smile turns red.

209
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
You told me.

210
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I said you could do.

211
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I heard you listen to music.

212
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
My friend told me at R OMG.

213
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Can you drive 48.195km, my friend?

214
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Have you ever done 48?

215
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Have you?

216
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Really, I don't get it.

217
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
No, it's not like that.

218
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
What are you doing?

219
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Well, how should I put it...

220
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
This country...

221
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Let's cut the country.

222
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
This country...

223
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
It's a country with a majority, right?

224
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
It's more than a small number of people...

225
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
What are you saying?

226
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Isn't that right?

227
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
It's a country where you can't beat 100 people by yourself.

228
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
And yet, you still think you know it.

229
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Even though you're a seaman, you only know about the population of the marathon.

230
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Compared to people who can't ride cars or people who get caught in traffic,

231
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
you're completely different.

232
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
But you still prioritize the marathon.

233
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
You don't get it.

234
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
It's because I don't listen.

235
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I think it's better to quit.

236
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Everyone should listen.

237
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
But you think so, right?

238
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
You know that what I'm saying is right, right?

239
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
No.

240
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Why?

241
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
There's nothing.

242
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
What kind of youth is this?

243
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
What kind of youth have you been through?

244
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
That's none of your business.

245
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
What are you eating?

246
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
That's right.

247
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
This is the New Year's Eve in Japan.

248
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
The New Year's Eve in the world.

249
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Even if you say that, the place you're running is different.

250
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
That's different.

251
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
It's the same no matter where you do it.

252
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
It doesn't make sense if you don't do it under the same conditions.

253
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
It's the same as a baseball stadium.

254
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
It's the same.

255
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Right?

256
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
You get it, right?

257
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
It's the same.

258
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
That's strange.

259
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Let's get rid of it together.

260
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
It doesn't make sense.

261
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Why?

262
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
When I was doing the broadcast,

263
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I went in like this.

264
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,000
You must have gone crazy.

265
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
You must have gone crazy.

266
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Do you want to get caught?

267
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Yes.

268
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
But you can come out right away, right?

269
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Well, I'm doing it.

270
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
You must have gone crazy.

271
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
You must have gone crazy.

272
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Your pants are all over the place.

273
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Are you waiting for that moment?

274
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
You can't do that.

275
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
It's really strange.

276
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I wonder what it's like.

277
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Running, swimming, riding a bicycle.

278
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
You don't know what it's like, do you?

279
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I don't know.

280
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
At first, you swim and come back.

281
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
You ride a bicycle and run at the end.

282
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
It's a mess in the second half.

283
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Well, it's a mess.

284
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
It's not like that.

285
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
It's a plan.

286
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
That's strange.

287
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
It doesn't make sense.

288
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
It makes sense.

289
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
It makes sense one by one.

290
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
It's okay to run all the time.

291
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Why don't you swim?

292
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
It's not like that.

293
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Which one do you use?

294
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I want you.

295
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
It's strange.

296
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Do you suddenly think like this?

297
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I don't think so.

298
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I don't think so.

299
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I'm going.

300
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
It's strange.

301
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
No one does that.

302
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
At the end, you cry.

303
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Well, it's okay.

304
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I don't do it for fun.

305
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Do your best.

306
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Do your best.

307
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Which one do you use?

308
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
When you go to a hair salon,

309
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
if someone asks you,

310
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
what are you going to do today?

311
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
How do you answer?

312
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Is it cool?

313
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Of course, there are many cool words.

314
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I don't understand the meaning of cool.

315
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
It depends on the dimension.

316
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Well,

317
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
it depends on the person's lifestyle.

318
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Do it like this.

319
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Do it like this.

320
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Do it again.

321
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Do it like this.

322
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Do it properly.

323
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:28,000
It depends on the environment.

324
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
It depends on the environment.

325
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I see.

326
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
For example,

327
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
if someone asks you,

328
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
what would you say?

329
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
If it's something you always say,

330
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
it's okay.

331
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Then it's not cool at all.

332
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
What is it?

333
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
That's what I don't understand.

334
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
What is cool?

335
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
For example,

336
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
you have a child.

337
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
When someone asks you,

338
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
what do you want him to do?

339
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
It doesn't matter what happens to me.

340
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Buy me a son.

341
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:04,000
It's cool.

342
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
You are waiting for the right moment.

343
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
You are going to the public bath.

344
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
It's not cool.

345
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
When you go to the public bath,

346
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
how do you make it look cool?

347
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I see.

348
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
You sit down.

349
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I see.

350
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
When someone asks you,

351
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
what do you want him to do?

352
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
I see.

353
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
It's different from other people.

354
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
It depends on the person.

355
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
It depends on the person,

356
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
but I'm more beautiful than that.

357
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
That's enough.

358
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
That's enough.

359
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
You have to say it.

360
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
That's right.

361
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
What do you want him to do?

362
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
There are many things,

363
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
but today...

364
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Today...

365
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
It's cool, isn't it?

366
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Yes.

367
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Today...

368
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Make it messy.

369
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Yes.

370
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
That's not what I mean.

371
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Make me messy.

372
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
That's why the situation is different.

373
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
In the first episode...

374
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
The two people who are rivals

375
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
are fighting like this.

376
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
It's Masota vs. Masota.

377
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,000
It's a three-on-three fight.

378
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
I'm not going to lose.

379
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Because it's the New Year.

380
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
The first event is

381
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:41,000
a flying box battle.

382
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Why did you blow up the box?

383
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Come on.

384
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,000
It's okay if you get caught by Mr. Muzo.

385
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
How is it?

386
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Okay.

387
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
What are you going to do?

388
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Do you have a mask?

389
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
No.

390
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
It's because it's a little cold.

391
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
I've never played.

392
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
No way.

393
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
What's that?

394
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
I'm sorry.

395
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
What are you doing?

396
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Wait a minute.

397
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
It hurts.

398
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
What are you going to do?

399
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,000
I prepared a hammer throw.

400
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Mr. Ikemoto.

401
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
In the first episode,

402
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
the two people who are rivals

403
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
are fighting like this.

404
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
It's Masota vs. Masota.

405
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:32,000
It's a three-on-three fight.

406
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,000
I'm not going to lose.

407
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:41,000
It's a hammer throw.

408
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
It looks good.

409
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
No way.

410
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,000
I won.

411
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
14 meters.

412
00:22:49,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Thank you very much.

413
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
There's smoke coming out.

414
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:14,000
There's smoke coming out.

415
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:20,000
It's scary.

416
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
If I didn't have a hammer,

417
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I wouldn't have won.

418
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Why is it exploding one by one?

419
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:39,000
I can't pay for it this time.

420
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
What is this?

421
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,000
It's a strange taste.

422
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
What should I do?

423
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
How about a hammer throw?

424
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
How many times can you do it?

425
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
This is enough.

426
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Is that okay?

427
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
That's fine.

428
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Really?

429
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,000
In the first episode,

430
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
the two people who are rivals

431
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
are fighting like this.

432
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:09,000
It's a three-on-three fight.

433
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:18,000
I'm not going to lose.

434
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:28,000
