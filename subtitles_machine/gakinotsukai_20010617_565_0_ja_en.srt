1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Thank you very much.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Thank you very much.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Thank you very much.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
The reason why I asked you to come here today is...

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Next week, we're going to have a special episode of our show.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
It's going to be a 7th episode.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Oh, a 7th episode?

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Yes.

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I'd like you to do it.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Oh, really?

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
The 7th episode of the special episode of Gaki no Tsukai that started with Matsumoto Hitoshi.

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Up until now, 13 famous people have come back with their own sense of humor.

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
There are 7 dramas in it.

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
And this time, a man with white teeth is going to appear.

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
For the first episode of Gaki no Tsukai, will it be Kichi or Kyoto?

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Yamashita Shigenori 7th episode!

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
It's been a year and a half.

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
That's right.

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Yamashita Shigenori 7th episode.

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
At this point...

21
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
The channel is going towards CX.

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
That's right.

23
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
This is not good. The atmosphere is not good.

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Really?

25
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Normally, when you go to a 7-yen shop, people ask you to give them 1000 yen bills.

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
But no one says anything.

27
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Everyone is full of bills.

28
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm just a little bit.

29
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Just a little bit?

30
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Yes.

31
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
The challenger is Yamashita Shigenori!

32
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Thank you.

33
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
It's Yamashita Shigenori.

34
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Yamashita Shigenori 32 years old.

35
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Born in 1991 in Yoshimoto, a Jyarizumu family.

36
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
With his sharp wit, he won the Grand Prize for Comedian and Newcomer Award.

37
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
He won them all and moved to Tokyo.

38
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
He has been on more shows recently, and in 1998, while he was still in the 80s,

39
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Yamashita's selfishness suddenly disbanded

40
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Even if he starts again as a pin comedian, he has a difficult life as a comedian

41
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
The more I work hard, the more I get hurt

42
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I think everyone will really get hurt during the show

43
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I think it's a little too slippery

44
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
No.1 so far

45
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
It's a polyvenom

46
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
That?

47
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
That's right

48
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
He got 44,000 yen

49
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I think it's Tanaka, Miyasako

50
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I don't like it!

51
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
He's a broadcaster, Takasu

52
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Where do you want to go?

53
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
At least I want to beat Miyasako

54
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Really?

55
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Don't hold it

56
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
It's scary

57
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I don't know

58
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I know what kind of guy Hamada likes

59
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
You know?

60
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I don't know!

61
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I don't like guys like you!

62
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
This program is brought to you by these sponsors

63
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
What should we do?

64
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Oh

65
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Right?

66
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Yeah

67
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
That's right

68
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
It's been a while, do you want to see someone?

69
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Suga-chan is writing a big book about Harley

70
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Oh

71
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
You can get parts for each

72
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Since it's a Harley?

73
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Yes

74
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
How much did it cost?

75
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
1.5 million yen

76
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
That's scary!

77
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
That's 1.5 million yen on a motorcycle

78
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
That's a lot

79
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
That's a lot

80
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
That's what it means

81
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
But this is interesting

82
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Tanaka's beard is in the water

83
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I want to quit water if I can

84
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Why?

85
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I'm going to get caught in the water

86
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I'm telling you to quit water

87
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
No one will think that I'm wearing this

88
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
What do you think?

89
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
There's something

90
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I'm sorry

91
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I'm sorry

92
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I'm sorry I'm late

93
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I didn't get the memo

94
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I see

95
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I got it

96
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I see I see

97
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I'm sorry

98
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I'm sorry

99
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
What are you going to do?

100
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I don't need that box

101
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
There are still 6 of them

102
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Really?

103
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Yes

104
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Thank you for the meal

105
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
It was a little cold

106
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I wonder if it was okay

107
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I broke the glass

108
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Brother

109
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I heard you moved

110
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Can I play with you?

111
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Sure

112
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Can I?

113
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Yes

114
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Can I play with you?

115
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Sure

116
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Can I play with you?

117
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Sure

118
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Can I go home?

119
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Sure

120
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Sure

121
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Thank you

122
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
He ran away

123
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
He ran away

124
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
He ran away

125
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
What's in there?

126
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I don't know

127
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
It's a guitar

128
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Yes

129
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I want to see

130
00:05:51,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I see

131
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I'm sorry

132
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I'm sorry but I'm not good at this

133
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I just laughed a little

134
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Can I laugh?

135
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
What?

136
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Yamasaki

137
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
What?

138
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I laughed

139
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I laughed a little

140
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Why did you laugh?

141
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
The door knob was very slippery

142
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I know

143
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
That was funny

144
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I want to move but the old man is great

145
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I can move freely

146
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
That was funny

147
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Yamasaki

148
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Yamasaki

149
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
What number did you say?

150
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Yes

151
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
It's 1000 yen

152
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I tried to say it for a long time

153
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
It's 1000 yen

154
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
It's too much

155
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
It's hard

156
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,000
To be honest, I can't hold it

157
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I have to take it off

158
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I'm scared to take it off by myself

159
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I'll help Kame

160
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Ouch

161
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:08,000
How do I take it off?

162
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I took it off

163
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I'm glad

164
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I'm glad

165
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I'm glad

166
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Is it okay for a comedian to explain first?

167
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
That's right

168
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Why are you doing this?

169
00:08:38,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I was surprised

170
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I was surprised

171
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Yamashita Shigenori-dono

172
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
You did a good job with the pain

173
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I was impressed

174
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Congratulations

175
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Thank you

176
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
That's all

177
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I didn't need that

178
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I'm a fool

179
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Why do you keep laughing at that little joke?

180
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
That's all

181
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I can't do it

182
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I can't do it

183
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I can't do it

184
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I can't do it

185
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I can't do it

186
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
What are you doing?

187
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,000
What are you doing?

188
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I love you

189
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I love you

190
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I love you

191
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I love you

192
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I love you

193
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I love you

194
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I love you

195
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I love you

196
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Put it all in

197
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
He's funny

198
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
What did you say?

199
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I said I love you

200
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I said I love you

201
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I love you

202
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I love you

203
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I love you

204
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
It's so funny

205
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Even if it's the second time

206
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
It has nothing to do with Yamashita

207
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:42,000
If you look at it like that

208
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I put it in

209
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I thought you were a fool

210
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
So it's 11,000 yen

211
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
11,000 yen

212
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
You're in 9th place

213
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
9th place?

214
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
You're in 9th place

215
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,000
By the way, Sugachan is an amateur

216
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I love you

217
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I love you

218
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I love you

219
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I love you

220
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I love you

221
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Good evening

222
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Do you know that?

223
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I heard it the other day

224
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I thought I see

225
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I'm going to stop saying that I'm a runaway

226
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
What do you mean?

227
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
A runaway is cool

228
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Naming

229
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
So I'm going to be a runaway

230
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
There are people who admire

231
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
There is no need to give a cool name

232
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Don't call it a runaway

233
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,000
It's called a runaway

234
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
No matter how much you say it

235
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I don't think it's a runaway

236
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I don't think so

237
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I don't think so

238
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
For example, the other day in the news

239
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
If you say that a runaway is something

240
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,000
It sounds cool

241
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:31,000
The news said that a runaway was running away

242
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
If you say that

243
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
It sounds cool

244
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Yesterday I said that was a runaway

245
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Sorry, I'm going to quit tomorrow

246
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
That's not true

247
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
That's a nuisance

248
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
That's right

249
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:52,000
They say that they don't cause any trouble

250
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
But when they are tired and sleeping

251
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Can't you say it's a nuisance?

252
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
You have to say it

253
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
You know it's a nuisance

254
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Then you should quit

255
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Everyone thinks so

256
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
When I say something good

257
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
The audience's reaction is like this

258
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Everyone thinks so

259
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Even if you don't say it's a nuisance

260
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Everyone thinks so

261
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I said that

262
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
So you have to change it from the news

263
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
That's right

264
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I don't know how to treat the news

265
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
But sometimes people go to snowy mountains

266
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Someone was in trouble the other day

267
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
He's gone

268
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
He's gone, right?

269
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
He's gone

270
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
What?

271
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
To the snowy mountains

272
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
He's going?

273
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
He's going

274
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
That's true

275
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Really?

276
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
He just went

277
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
He said it's cold

278
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
He was treated like a challenger

279
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
He was treated like a good person

280
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
The next day

281
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
There was an old man who climbed up the snowy mountain

282
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
He was arrested

283
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Why?

284
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
It's the same as a challenger

285
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
It's just different

286
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Everyone was clapping

287
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Everyone was clapping

288
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,000
He couldn't get the ball

289
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Isn't that strange?

290
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:35,000
It's the law that you can't just climb up the mountain

291
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Why can't I just climb up the mountain?

292
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
It's not your thing

293
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I can't just climb up something that's not mine?

294
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I can't just climb up on the spot?

295
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
What do you mean?

296
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,000
You can't just climb up on the spot?

297
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
You can't just say that?

298
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I can't do anything

299
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
That's the law

300
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
You can't do that

301
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:04,000
There were a lot of strange old men who climbed up the mountain

302
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Like the spider man

303
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
They were fighting

304
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
That old man climbed up the mountain

305
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
He was arrested

306
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
He was really tired

307
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
He wasn't even a spider man

308
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
He was really weak

309
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
He was really weak

310
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I thought it was amazing

311
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
No one wanted to climb up the mountain

312
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
That's strange

313
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
It's the law that you can't just climb up the mountain

314
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Why can't I just climb up the mountain?

315
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
It's the same with Everest

316
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
It's the same with Everest

317
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
It's the law that you can't just climb up the mountain

318
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Everyone was clapping

319
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Even in Everest, if you climb up the mountain, you can't just climb up

320
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Where are the people who climb up the mountain?

321
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
They're always in Everest

322
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
That's the law

323
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Don't say that

324
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Who said that?

325
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Who said that?

326
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
That's the law

327
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I'm doing Project X

328
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I'm doing a documentary on NHK

329
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I can cry when I see an old man who climbed up the mountain

330
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
It depends on how you treat them

331
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I wonder if I can cry when I see an old man who climbs up the mountain

332
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
You can cry

333
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Your upper body is naked

334
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
It has nothing to do with being naked

335
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
That's why I'm doing a documentary

336
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:39,000
You were crying

337
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,000
That was the moment when I was like this

338
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
What?

339
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
The feeling between you and me

340
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:55,000
This is a question for Matsumoto-san, who is a volunteer in the Japanese soccer team

341
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:06,000
What does Torsier Japan recommend as a flat 3?

342
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
What is a volanchy?

343
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
What?

344
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
You don't even know that?

345
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Can you teach me?

346
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Volanchy

347
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Simply put, it's like joy

348
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Volanchy, volanchy

349
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Volanchy is about the position of the defense

350
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
That's right

351
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
That's where it comes from

352
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
It's about joy

353
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Okay, then

354
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Where do you call a person a volanchy?

355
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
There's a circle in the middle of soccer

356
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
It's around that

357
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
That's usually the position of a volanchy

358
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,000
If you can play well there, it's a volanchy

359
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
What does a flat 3 mean?

360
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
It's too late to explain

361
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
But I don't know

362
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:04,000
You can just translate it into English

363
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,000
What does a flat mean?

364
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:13,000
A flat is a volanchy

365
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
What does a volanchy mean?

366
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:20,000
It means to be forgiven 3 times

367
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
What does that mean?

368
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
It was 45 minutes, right?

369
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:30,000
It means you can forgive 3 times

370
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
You can forgive 3 times?

371
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
You can take off your shoes and go around

372
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
No, no, no

373
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
That's not allowed

374
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
It means you can forgive 3 times

375
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
But that's not allowed

376
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
That's not allowed

377
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
It's been said

378
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
It's been said

379
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
So let's not do that

380
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
That's right

381
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Flat 3?

382
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Aren't you doing it right now?

383
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Flat 3?

384
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I'm doing it

385
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:03,000
In Italy, it's flat 3 every day

386
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Flat 3 for women who drink

387
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
I see

388
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
That's why

389
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Let's not stick to one ball

390
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
It's called cataclysm

391
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Cataclysm?

392
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
So you add 2 more balls

393
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
And you think which one is the real one

394
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:32,000
You put it in and it's out

395
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
It appears in ancient myth many times

396
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:40,000
And it's a question to Matsumoto who changes the color of the temple

397
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I don't know

398
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:50,000
What kind of smell does kentaurus have?

399
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:55,000
What kind of question is that?

400
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I don't know

401
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
I don't know

402
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:02,000
When you see it, you think it's an animal, right?

403
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
That's right

404
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,000
It's a mixture of humans and animals

405
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
So what kind of smell is that?

406
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I was in the elevator with kentaurus once

407
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
It was a very small elevator

408
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
I went to the 8th floor with kentaurus

409
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
I went to the 9th floor

410
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I was with kentaurus for a long time

411
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
So I could smell it

412
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I see

413
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:36,000
What kind of smell is that?

414
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
The most easy to understand smell is

415
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:45,000
The smell of the air conditioner I turned on for the first time this year

416
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
It doesn't smell that bad

417
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
But it's still breathing

418
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
It breathes kentaurus

419
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Up and down

420
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Do you know kentaurus?

421
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Half, half

422
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Is that so?

423
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Kentaurus is an animal that breathes

424
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Did you just say half?

425
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Why did you say half?

426
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
No, no

427
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,000
When kentaurus breathes, it breathes animals

428
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Half, half

429
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,000
But this is different between animals and humans

430
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
It breathes animals

431
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
When I'm in the car, the car here and the car here

432
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,000
I feel irritated

433
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:52,000
So if you ask me if it smells or not

434
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
The bottom one smells

435
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
It smells like poop

436
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
That's what I mean

437
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,000
The bottom one doesn't only smell like poop

438
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
I made a mistake

439
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
What have I been saying?

440
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:19,000
I've been saying things like this

441
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
I've been talking nicely

442
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,000
I was wondering if there was a face here

443
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
There isn't a face

444
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
It's just a difference in memory

445
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
To be honest, this animal here

446
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
It smells like poop

447
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
It smells like poop?

448
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
It smells like poop

449
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
But this one is different

450
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
It smells like Tactics

451
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,000
It goes bang, bang

452
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
It's so nostalgic

453
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Tactics

454
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:22,000
It's Tactics
