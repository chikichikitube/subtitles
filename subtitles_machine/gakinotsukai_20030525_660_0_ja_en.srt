00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
On May 4th, a girl was born who was waiting for Kokoriko Endo and Chiaki. Her name is Iroha-chan. Endo became a happy father.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
It's cute.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Thank you.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
It's good.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
It's good.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I didn't think you would bring it.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I didn't think you would bring it.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I didn't think you would bring it.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
You should have acted.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
It's not acting.

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
It's like a hand of a mummy.

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
It's cute.

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The eyes are similar.

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Really?

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The eyes are similar.

16
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Good morning.

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Good morning.

18
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Good morning.

19
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Good morning.

20
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Everyone might know this.

21
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
A twin was born.

22
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
A twin was born.

23
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Good morning.

24
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
A cute baby was born to Tsuyoshi from the Nakagawa family.

25
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
He is twice as happy as the twins.

26
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Congratulations!

27
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
What's the relationship between you two?

28
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
It's a boy who met Ten.

29
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
It's a boy.

30
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
It's cute.

31
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
It's cute.

32
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
They have the same face.

33
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
You two should celebrate it in the Nakagawa family.

34
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
It's Yamazaki and Dawn Dawn.

35
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
It's Yamazaki and Dawn Dawn.

36
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
It's Yamazaki and Dawn Dawn.

37
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Thank you.

38
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
It's Yamazaki and Dawn Dawn.

39
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Thank you.

40
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I think the order is the opposite.

41
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
What do you mean?

42
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
No, I haven't received it yet.

43
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
It's a sin.

44
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
No, but...

45
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
It's fine.

46
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I'm not saying that I want money.

47
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
That's fine.

48
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
No, the order is different.

49
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
The order is different.

50
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
It's fine to say that I'll give it to you.

51
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
But that's strange.

52
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
It's fine to say that.

53
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Who was born first?

54
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I was born first.

55
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Oh, I see.

56
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
No, but...

57
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
There's a way to date.

58
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
But you haven't received it yet, have you?

59
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
You said you'd give it to me if you could.

60
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
What?

61
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
What?

62
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
What?

63
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
It's fine to say that I'll give it to you.

64
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
No, the order is different.

65
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
You said you'd give it to me if you could.

66
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
It's fine to say that.

67
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
That's right.

68
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
You said you'd give it to me if you could.

69
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
You said you'd give it to me if you could.

70
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
What the hell are you talking about?

71
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Hey, hey, hey!

72
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Hey, hey, hey!

73
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Hey, hey, hey!

74
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Stop it.

75
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Stop it!

76
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Stop it!

77
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
You guys, stop it.

78
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
What?

79
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
The order is...

80
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Hey, what?

81
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
You said that.

82
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Oh, my God.

83
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
It's strange.

84
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
It's strange.

85
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
It's strange to give it to you.

86
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
No, no.

87
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I'm wearing it.

88
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I'm wearing it on purpose.

89
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
You're not wearing it on purpose?

90
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I'm not wearing it on purpose.

91
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I'm here to say hello.

92
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:33,180
You're not wearing a

93
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
This is weird.

94
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
What?

95
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
You're not wearing it on purpose.

96
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I'm wearing it on purpose.

97
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
You're not wearing it on purpose.

98
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Stop it.

99
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I don't know if you're right.

100
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
What's going on?

101
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
What's going on?

102
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Nagakawa and Kokoriko.

103
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
That's right.

104
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
11 years.

105
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
How many years?

106
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
11 years.

107
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
That's pretty much it.

108
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Well, the way we came out was different.

109
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
We were in Tokyo.

110
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Senpai, you don't have to be afraid.

111
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
We were in the same class.

112
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
We were in the same class.

113
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
You're the one who's embarrassed!

114
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
You haven't said anything about being embarrassed!

115
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
You're the one who's embarrassed!

116
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
You've said it every time!

117
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Do you remember 5 or 6 years ago?

118
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
What?

119
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I was on the radio in Nagoya for a week.

120
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I was on the radio in Nagoya for a week.

121
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Suddenly, the director and producer there told me to make a fool of myself.

122
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Suddenly, the director and producer there told me to make a fool of myself.

123
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
What's that?

124
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Why?

125
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Why?

126
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Why?

127
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I asked why.

128
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
They said it was more famous.

129
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
They said it was more famous.

130
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Then it became 0, when it was airing in Tokyo.

131
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Then it became 0, when it was airing in Tokyo.

132
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
It became nothing but a theater station.

133
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
It wasn't until then, when we justальной that number it got 0.

134
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
It wasn't until then, when we justintealized it got 0.

135
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
It wasn't until then, when we we became gunnybugs.

136
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
If you guys continue to do that...

137
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I know, but they say that's was actually still making a fool of themselves.

138
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I know, but they say that's was actually still making a fool of themselves.

139
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Stop it!

140
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Since then, there's been a suggestion that I realized confess was not a good idea.

141
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Since then, there's been a suggestion that I realized confess was not a good idea.

142
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I think it would be better to have a deep love for children.

143
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:29,000
For example, it would be better to do a joke in front of the children, and the one who gets it will receive the gift.

144
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I see.

145
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I've never done it in front of the children.

146
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Me neither.

147
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I see.

148
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I don't know about you, but what about you, Yamazaki?

149
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I've done it before.

150
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Yes.

151
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,000
The genius TV-kun and I, Yamazaki Ichiban, are holding the children's hearts tightly.

152
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Yes.

153
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
What?

154
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
We haven't done it yet.

155
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
So, what do you do to receive the children?

156
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
And from Yamazaki, the lecture is about what the children will receive.

157
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Now, the battle between the children of the Nakagawa family versus the children of the Kokoriko family begins.

158
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Yes, this is it.

159
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:24,000
This program is brought to you by the sponsor.

160
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:30,000
The Children's Artist, Chibikko Theater

161
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Hey, it's Yama-chan!

162
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Everyone!

163
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:51,000
It's a boob!

164
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:59,000
From now on, the brother will tell everyone a little story.

165
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Once upon a time, there was an old man and an old woman.

166
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:16,000
The old man went hunting in the mountains, and the old woman went to the river to wash clothes.

167
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:31,000
When the old woman was washing clothes in the river, a big, big poop came out of the upper part of the river.

168
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:40,000
A big poop came out of the upper part of the river, and the old woman went to the river to wash clothes.

169
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:46,000
From now on, two groups of friends will come out.

170
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:53,000
And the two groups will come out, so please judge which brother was fun later.

171
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Do you understand?

172
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
First of all, let's welcome Mr. Kogoriko.

173
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Everyone, please give him a round of applause.

174
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I'm hungry. I'm really hungry.

175
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I haven't eaten anything for three days.

176
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:31,000
That's right. Let's call Anpanman. Anpanman!

177
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Anpanman?

178
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Did you call me?

179
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Are you Anpanman?

180
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
No, no, no. Anpanman won't come today.

181
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
In place, my brother came.

182
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Who is your brother?

183
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
My brother's name is...

184
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Oshiri Anpanman!

185
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Oshiri Anpanman?

186
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Look, his head is shaped like an ass.

187
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
That's right. His ass is plump.

188
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
What happened to you today?

189
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I'm hungry and I haven't eaten anything.

190
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Okay, then I'll give you this.

191
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
What?

192
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Eat my ass.

193
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
No, I don't want to eat your ass.

194
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
This ass is delicious.

195
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Really?

196
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Munch, munch, munch, munch.

197
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Eat it.

198
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
It's delicious.

199
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Do you want to eat it too?

200
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Yes.

201
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Then tear it up and eat it.

202
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Give it to me. Give it to me.

203
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
It stinks. It stinks. It stinks.

204
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Your ass stinks.

205
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

206
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
My brother's ass is smelly.

207
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Stop it. It stinks. It stinks.

208
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Okay, tear it up and eat it again.

209
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Yes.

210
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
It stinks. It stinks. Your ass stinks.

211
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
It came out again.

212
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Okay, this time...

213
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
It stinks. It stinks.

214
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
It stinks. It stinks. It stinks.

215
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Okay, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

216
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I'm really sorry.

217
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Eat this.

218
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Yes.

219
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
It's delicious.

220
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Isn't it?

221
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Yes.

222
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Hey, hey, where did it come from?

223
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
The Oshiri Panman came from the Oshiri planet.

224
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
The Oshiri planet?

225
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Yes.

226
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
The Oshiri planet is a planet that is split into two parts.

227
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
In the middle of that, a smelly smell comes out.

228
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
That's a fart. It stinks. It stinks.

229
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
That's right. This is it.

230
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
It stinks. It stinks. It stinks.

231
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
This is it.

232
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Stop it.

233
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
It stinks.

234
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I don't want it anymore. I don't want it anymore. I don't want it anymore. I don't want it anymore.

235
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
It stinks. It stinks.

236
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Sometimes, the middle of that planet is split into two parts.

237
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
From the middle, a brown object comes out.

238
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
That's poop.

239
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I hate poop.

240
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
From the Oshiri planet, you already have a souvenir.

241
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
A souvenir?

242
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Look inside the land cell.

243
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
What is it? What is it?

244
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I'm looking forward to it. I'm looking forward to it. Is it in here?

245
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
What is it?

246
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Hey.

247
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
It's poop. I hate it. I hate poop.

248
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
It stinks.

249
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
What is it, Oshiri-pappa?

250
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:36,000
This sound is the sound of something happening in Oshiri planet.

251
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Shouldn't we go quickly?

252
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Why don't you come with us and fight?

253
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I don't want to. I don't want to.

254
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Are you going to fight?

255
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Yes.

256
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
If you fight, your mom and dad will be full of poop.

257
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I don't want to be full of poop. Let's go.

258
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Then let's go.

259
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Yes.

260
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
It stinks. It stinks. It stinks.

261
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
It stinks. It stinks. It stinks. It stinks.

262
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Yes.

263
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:10,000
That was the children of Kokoriko.

264
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
But you were thrown on the way.

265
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
You can get angry when you meet.

266
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I'm angry.

267
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I'm angry.

268
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I'm angry.

269
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
With elephant's nose.

270
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I'm angry.

271
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Next, let's see the brother of Nakagawa family.

272
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Everyone, clap.

273
00:11:43,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Nakagawa family.

274
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Oshiri, Oshiri, Oshiri, Oshiri, ching, ching.

275
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
This is poop.

276
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Oh, no.

277
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
That's all.

278
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Next, let's see the brother of Nakagawa family.

279
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
That's all.

280
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
That's all.

281
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Next, let's see the brother of Nakagawa family.

282
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Next, let's see the brother of Nakagawa family.

283
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
That's all.

284
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
That's all.

285
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
That's all.

286
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
That's all.

287
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
That's all.

288
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
That's all.

289
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
That's all.

290
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
That's all.

291
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Next, let's see the brother of Nakagawa family.

292
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
What are you doing?

293
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Hey, it's me!

294
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Hey!

295
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Hey!

296
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Hey, you're pooping!

297
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
No, no, no, I'm not!

298
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
You're pooping!

299
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Then, you have to poop three times!

300
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Hey, you're pooping!

301
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
You're pooping!

302
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
You're a mess!

303
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Hey, if the other person did something bad, you should have brought 2 million yen!

304
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Huh?

305
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Hey, you should have brought this!

306
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Who are you looking at?

307
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Who are you looking at?

308
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Who are you looking at?

309
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
We just had 2 teams do it.

310
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
If you think it was interesting,

311
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
get ready and run!

312
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Not yet, not yet, not yet, not yet!

313
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Let's go!

314
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
This way, this way!

315
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Let's go!

316
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Ready!

317
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Go!

318
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:00,000
11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 people!

319
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
11, 12, 13, 14 people!

320
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:09,000
That means, Kokoriko's brother wins!

321
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Then, let's give Kokoriko a round of applause!

322
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Thank you very much!

323
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,000
This year, Kokoriko will appear on M1 on this show.

324
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Really?

325
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Nakagawa is dirty, right?

326
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Who are you talking about?

327
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Who are you talking about?

328
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
You're a grown-up!

329
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
If it weren't for that, I wouldn't have won!

330
00:15:44,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I'm a grown-up!

331
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Good evening!

332
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I'm sure there are many of you.

333
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Right?

334
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I don't know.

335
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
What is it?

336
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
What should I do? A punishment game?

337
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
A punishment game?

338
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
What should I do?

339
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
What should I do?

340
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Are you talking about bowling?

341
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,000
That's just having fun bowling with everyone.

342
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

343
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
What are you talking about?

344
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
You keep saying it's hard to lose.

345
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
This punishment game is tough.

346
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
It's tough, right?

347
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
It's going to get harder.

348
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
So what should I do?

349
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,000
You're too good at having fun bowling by yourself.

350
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Everyone's bowling with four people.

351
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
You make it look like it's easy.

352
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
But in the end, you get beaten up.

353
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
And then you end up with a girlfriend.

354
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
You're a professional.

355
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I'm such a fool.

356
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
You did it with Katsuki before.

357
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I wonder what I did.

358
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,000
It was a great show.

359
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
This is really...

360
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
What should I do?

361
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,000
If it's not that hard, it's meaningless.

362
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Mentally and physically.

363
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I'm sorry.

364
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I'm an S.

365
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
You're an M.

366
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:02,000
People like you don't know the limits.

367
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I have love in the end.

368
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Why?

369
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I really have love.

370
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
It comes out of my pocket.

371
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I can't help it.

372
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
You had love in the past.

373
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I had love.

374
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I wonder if it's okay.

375
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I don't know what you think.

376
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
There was a hotel before.

377
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
That was a week ago.

378
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I was depressed.

379
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I really didn't like it.

380
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I understand.

381
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
We've experienced it.

382
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
You're such a demon.

383
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Mentally and physically.

384
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Yamazaki said that.

385
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
He used to spend 10,000 yen.

386
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Do it for 48 hours.

387
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
No, no, no, no.

388
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
No, no, no, no.

389
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Let's do something like that.

390
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Otherwise, it's meaningless.

391
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I don't have any budget for this show.

392
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I only have 20,000 yen.

393
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
I can't do anything.

394
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
It's a little crazy.

395
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I can't do that either.

396
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
You can think about it.

397
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,000
But there are four of us.

398
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Yamazaki didn't get hurt that much.

399
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
He's on TV.

400
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
He's still young.

401
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
He's a little crazy.

402
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
He's in his 40s.

403
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Entry number one.

404
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
He's in his 40s.

405
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
It's the worst.

406
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
The other day,

407
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
I was doing something cowardly.

408
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I was eating.

409
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
I was in a private room.

410
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
There was an iron bar.

411
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
An iron bar?

412
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
It's a guy with rough eyes.

413
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I can't see it from the other side.

414
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
When I got in, I thought it was noisy.

415
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
It was a stupid family.

416
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
There was an old woman, a father, a child.

417
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
It's like a child actor.

418
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Hey, here's the ice cream.

419
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Here's the ice cream.

420
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
It's not a bar that brings kids.

421
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
I don't know what this kid is doing.

422
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
I can't see it.

423
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
I think it's...

424
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
It's not open.

425
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
It's...

426
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
It's making a sound.

427
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
It's making a sound.

428
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Sometimes it's...

429
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
It's hitting the body.

430
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,000
It's hitting the body.

431
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Now, everyone is pulling me.

432
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Hey, that's...

433
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
It's something a child does.

434
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
I said it's something a child does.

435
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I've been hit more than 10 times.

436
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I just gave it back once.

437
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
That's the problem.

438
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
When the other person complains,

439
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
When the parents come,

440
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
I said something.

441
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
It came out like this.

442
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
What happened?

443
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
After that, it came out like this.

444
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
It came out like this.

445
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Hey, I'm sorry.

446
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
It's something a child does.

447
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Oh...

448
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
I can't say anything.

449
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
It's this.

450
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I can't help it.

451
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
It's this.

452
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
I can't help it.

453
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
That's cowardly.

454
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
It's hard if you do that.

455
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
It's hard if you do that.

456
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
It's hard if you do that.

457
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
That's a problem.

458
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
I can't help it.

459
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I'm addicted to it.

460
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:58,000
It's the opposite version of the tiger.

461
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:04,000
The safest thing to do is to have a lot of children.

462
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
What?

463
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
It's very comfortable.

464
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
What's safe?

465
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:17,000
It's the safest thing to do is to have a lot of children.

466
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:22,000
I have a question for Mr. Matsumoto who likes the part of the circle of the zoo.

467
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
The circle?

468
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
The circle of the zoo.

469
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Oh, the circle.

470
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:33,000
What kind of rabbit is the rabbit that Mr. Matsumoto used to have?

471
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Oh, there was one.

472
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Oh, really?

473
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Yes.

474
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
It's zero.

475
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
But it looks like a rabbit, doesn't it?

476
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
It looks like a rabbit.

477
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
I don't know if it's zero.

478
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
That's right.

479
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:49,000
First of all, it's 2.5 meters.

480
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
May I? May I? May I?

481
00:22:52,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Don't put your ears in!

482
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:05,000
If you put your ears in, it's 5 meters.

483
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,000
He told me to put my ears in.

484
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
If it's a measurement, it's a measurement.

485
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
That's no good.

486
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
That's why it's zero.

487
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:23,000
I don't know if you're going to put your ears in!

488
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I don't know!

489
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,000
It's rolling.

490
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,000
It's pooping! It's pooping!

491
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
It doesn't change.

492
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
It doesn't change.

493
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
It's like a junior high school student.

494
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
By the way, what's wrong with that?

495
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Did you throw it somewhere?

496
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
I threw it away.

497
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
It's 5 meters long.

498
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
You're going to get caught.

499
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
It's going to fly away.

500
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:54,000
I'm here to throw it away.

501
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,000
I can't throw it away!

502
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
It's pooping! It's pooping!

503
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:07,000
I'm here to throw it away!

504
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:13,000
After a year and four months of silence, that fateful confrontation approaches Yamasaki's body.

505
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Will he be able to defeat the strongest champion in the world?

506
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Yamasaki vs. Moriman will be released soon.
