00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
High Tension! The Best Ten!

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Hello everyone! Good evening!

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Long time no see!

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
That's right!

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Ah, that's right! Long time no see!

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Long time no see!

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Ah, you're so dirty!

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
What are you talking about?

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I'm really beautiful!

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I was like that yesterday too!

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Yes!

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Let's start right away!

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Yes!

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I will announce the rankings!

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
First of all, this week's 10th place is...

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
24 points!

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Electric Illumination!

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Kogoriko Tamakorouki!

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Congratulations!

20
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Yes!

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
The difference is 10,000 years!

22
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
10,000 years!

23
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
That's amazing!

24
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I have to work a little harder!

25
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Well, the studio's temperature hasn't warmed up at all, but...

26
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Please raise it!

27
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Please leave it to me!

28
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Eh?

29
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Please leave it to me!

30
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Please leave it to me!

31
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Please leave it to me!

32
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Please leave it to me!

33
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Eh?

34
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Please take it!

35
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Last!

36
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Please take care of me!

37
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Please take care of me!

38
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Yes!

39
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Then let's go!

40
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
This week's 10th place!

41
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Kogoriko Tamakorouki!

42
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Electric Illumination!

43
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Hora!

44
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Hora!

45
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Yes, take care!

46
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Eh?

47
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Roden!

48
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Roden!

49
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Teiki!

50
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Yes, Teiki!

51
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
It's leaking!

52
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Yes!

53
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
It's leaking!

54
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Gari!

55
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Gari!

56
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Gari gari gari gari!

57
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Electric!

58
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Yes, thank you very much!

59
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
That guy hasn't changed much since last year!

60
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
That's right!

61
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
He always looks like a brain!

62
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
This program is brought to you by the following sponsors.

63
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Then let's go!

64
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
That's right!

65
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
This week's 9th place is...

66
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
43 points!

67
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Save the Earth!

68
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Karateka Yabetaro!

69
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Please give him a round of applause!

70
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
He's Yabe...

71
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Yes!

72
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
It's my first time too!

73
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Yes, it's your first time too!

74
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Nice to meet you!

75
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Yabe-san, how old are you?

76
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I'm 25 years old.

77
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
25 years old!

78
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Don't touch me like that!

79
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
You're the one who's talking!

80
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
How is it?

81
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
It's like seeing your senpai sliding around!

82
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Right?

83
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
To be honest, I'm starting to feel confident!

84
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
That's right!

85
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
When I see that...

86
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
That's right!

87
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I'm like, is this really okay?

88
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Yabe-san, please give him a round of applause!

89
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Ah, that's right!

90
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Are you okay?

91
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Let's go! This week's 9th place!

92
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Save the Earth with Karateka Yabetaro!

93
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Hey, Kannon! Hey, Kannon! Hey, Kannon! Hey, Kannon! Hey, Kannon! Really, Kannon! Really, Kannon! Really, Kannon!

94
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Thank you very much!

95
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Well, it's better than 10th place.

96
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Let's go to 10th place!

97
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Let's go!

98
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,000
This week's 8th place goes to...

99
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
51 points!

100
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
The men who became the wind, Osaru!

101
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Congratulations!

102
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Thank you!

103
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Thank you!

104
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Thank you!

105
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Today, we have important news from our manager, Osaru-san.

106
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
What is it?

107
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Osaru-san, since April, you were told that the new regular was decided, right?

108
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Yes, I was told.

109
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Actually, the other day, it was changed to Sakamoto-chan, so I'm sorry.

110
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Now, let's raise the tension!

111
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I want you to overcome this with high tension.

112
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I thought I finally got in.

113
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Are you still going to use Sakamoto-chan?

114
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
It's the same, the manager.

115
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Is that so?

116
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
My eyes are dead.

117
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
It's still the same, from the beginning.

118
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Then, let's go to 3rd place!

119
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I understand.

120
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I should have said it before doing it.

121
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
This week's 8th place goes to...

122
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
The men who became the wind, Keirin!

123
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:43,000
There's no bridge!

124
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
You're still blue, huh.

125
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Don't turn around!

126
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
You want to beat me?

127
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Thank you!

128
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Thank you very much!

129
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,000
As expected, Sarasai-san's sense of rhythm is amazing.

130
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Then, let's continue.

131
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
This week's seventh place is...

132
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
The winner is...

133
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
The winner is...

134
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
The winner is...

135
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Congratulations, Izurin Okada!

136
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Please come over here!

137
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Wow, Izurin-san!

138
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
This is humorous.

139
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
This is your first appearance.

140
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
It's my first appearance and I'm seventh place, so this is a big deal.

141
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Thank you very much.

142
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Izurin-san, this is your first appearance.

143
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I heard you have a special skill using your tongue.

144
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Oh my, that's good.

145
00:06:45,000 --> 00:07:04,000
It's called high-speed

146
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
That's a good thing.

147
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I'm looking forward to it.

148
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I'll show you.

149
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Huh?

150
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
You're going to do it separately?

151
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Separately?

152
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I can do it with anyone!

153
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Izurin-san, please come over here.

154
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
This is your first appearance.

155
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Then, this week's seventh place is...

156
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Izurin Okada's...

157
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Nishinippori no Yoru!

158
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Monday Choice! Monday Choice!

159
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Finger Vibe!

160
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Nishinippori! Nishinippori!

161
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Stalker? Stalker? Stalker?

162
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Stalker? Stalker?

163
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Look! Look! Look!

164
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Yosemite Park! Yosemite Park!

165
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Y-O-S-E-M-I-T-E

166
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Yosemite! Yosemite!

167
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Y-O-K-O-M-I-T-E

168
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Yoko-Mite!

169
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Thank you very much!

170
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
That was great.

171
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I'm so excited that I'm going to do it separately.

172
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
You're going to do it separately, right?

173
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Then, let's take him!

174
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,000
The sixth place goes to...

175
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
113 points!

176
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Noboshiku Kangen Ram!

177
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Hamewari Keshitai Miyasako Hiroyuki!

178
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Thank you very much!

179
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
He's got such a wide body.

180
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Miyasako-san, by the way, Christmas is a family service, right?

181
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
That's right.

182
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I spent Christmas with my family.

183
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I heard you went to buy a lot of toys.

184
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Toys for the house.

185
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Oh, really?

186
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
You bought a lot of toys for your children.

187
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I often forgot toys in my apartment.

188
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I see.

189
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Can you say something?

190
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Can you say something?

191
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
He's crazy.

192
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Thank you very much!

193
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I'm so excited.

194
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Let's go!

195
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
The sixth place goes to...

196
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Hamewari Keshitai Miyasako Hiroyuki!

197
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Noboshiku Kangen Ram!

198
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Gorilla!

199
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Run!

200
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Run!

201
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Run!

202
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Run!

203
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Run!

204
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Run!

205
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Run!

206
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Run!

207
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Run!

208
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Run!

209
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Run!

210
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
It feels good!

211
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
It feels good!

212
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
It feels good!

213
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
You're lying!

214
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
It doesn't feel good!

215
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Your arms are like this!

216
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Oh, I see.

217
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Thank you very much!

218
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,000
During that short time, I could see you wavering.

219
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Yabe-kun probably doesn't laugh much.

220
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
What do you think, Yabe-kun?

221
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
What do you think?

222
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I wonder if it's like this.

223
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Everyone, the fifth place goes to...

224
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
137, Iipara Fukawa Ryo!

225
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Congratulations!

226
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Fukawa-san, do you remember last time?

227
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Last time it was around here.

228
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
What?

229
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Around here.

230
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Then just talk normally.

231
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
It's hard to overcome the five walls.

232
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I see.

233
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
It's difficult.

234
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Fukawa-san, we have a special guest today.

235
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Please welcome!

236
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
What?

237
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Why?

238
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
How are you?

239
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
If you have energy, you can do it many times.

240
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
If you have energy, you can be a great high tension entertainer.

241
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Fukawa!

242
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Don't be a fool.

243
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Relax your stomach and pull your chin.

244
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
How was it? Did you have energy?

245
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Yes, thank you.

246
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Don't say that if you don't have energy.

247
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I understand.

248
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Don't make a scene where I come out.

249
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
You can make a scene.

250
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Fukawa-kun!

251
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Fukawa-kun!

252
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Let's do our best!

253
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
This week's 5th place is Fukawa!

254
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I don't want to say this, but...

255
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Recently, people are saying that you can take a video or a photo.

256
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I don't care about that. Just break the last one of the battery.

257
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Break it!

258
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Break it here!

259
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Don't be a fool!

260
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
You'll be a guide until the end.

261
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
If the screen is clean or the sound is clear.

262
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I don't care!

263
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Break it here!

264
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Hey, if it's a download or a thumbnail.

265
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I don't care!

266
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Break it here!

267
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
And...

268
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Don't be a fool!

269
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Yes, thank you very much!

270
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
There was one more, right?

271
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
There was one more, right?

272
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I'm sorry.

273
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Fukawa-san, do you want to sit down?

274
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
If you can sit down, please sit down.

275
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Next, Sakoji's number one is...

276
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
148 points!

277
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Do as you please!

278
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Mugendai Amiwari Kestai Hotarakon!

279
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Thank you very much!

280
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Wonderful!

281
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
This is wonderful!

282
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Are you ready?

283
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
It's getting better, isn't it?

284
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
It wasn't good at all last time.

285
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Ah, is that so?

286
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
But you can come this far.

287
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
That's right.

288
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
But it's powerful.

289
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
It's better than last time, this time.

290
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
That's a matter of course.

291
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I see.

292
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Then, please!

293
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Thank you very much!

294
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Everyone's attitude is...

295
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Why do you want to enter from the other side?

296
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Even if you enter from the other side, it will be the same as before, right?

297
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Then, let's go.

298
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
This week's number four is...

299
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Amiwari Kestai Hotarakon!

300
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Do as you please! Mugendai!

301
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Come on, beard!

302
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Come on, beard!

303
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Come on, beard!

304
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Let's go!

305
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
It's a smash!

306
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
It's a smash!

307
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
A beard smash!

308
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
A beard smash!

309
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
A beard smash!

310
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
A beard smash!

311
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,000
Come on, beard, come on!

312
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Come on, beard, beard!

313
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Come on, beard!

314
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Come on! Smash it!

315
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Two at infinity!

316
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
What?

317
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Thank you very much!

318
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
This is...

319
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
But it's wonderful!

320
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Yes, yes, yes.

321
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
The tension is quite high.

322
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
The tension is quite high.

323
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
That's right.

324
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Is that tension?

325
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I don't think you're underestimating me.

326
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I'm doing it seriously.

327
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I'm doing it seriously.

328
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I'll do it like this.

329
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I'll do it like this.

330
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
What is this?

331
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
What is this?

332
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
What?

333
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
What?

334
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
What?

335
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
What?

336
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
What?

337
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
What?

338
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
What?

339
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Let's go!

340
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
This week's 3rd place is...

341
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
171 points!

342
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
To the heart of the earth!

343
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Kogoriko, Endo Shouzo!

344
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Congratulations!

345
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
No, after all...

346
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
You're definitely...

347
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
It's a dignified thing.

348
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Is it 3rd place?

349
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I used to be called Ai Hou Hoi.

350
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Well, I got 1st place.

351
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Well, I got 1st place.

352
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Well, Ai Hou Hoi is...

353
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Well, I got 1st place.

354
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
0!

355
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
How about this time?

356
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
How about this time?

357
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Did you get it checked by your wife?

358
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I...

359
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I didn't take a video!

360
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
After all...

361
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Next year...

362
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
The junior will be born.

363
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I told her to record the video.

364
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I told her to record the video.

365
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
It's okay.

366
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Please go to 3rd place.

367
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Please go to 3rd place.

368
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Oh, that's good.

369
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Really?

370
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Really?

371
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I think I just decided.

372
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Let's go!

373
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
This week's 3rd place!

374
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
To the heart of the earth!

375
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,000
To the heart of the earth!

376
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Bring me the pancake right now!

377
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000

Bring it quickly!

379
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Pancake?

Be a good child!

386
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Do you have a brain?

387
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Do you have a brain?

388
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Do you have a brain?

389
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Be a good child!

390
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000

Be a good child!

392
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Do you have twins?

393
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
No, I don't.

394
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
No, I don't.

395
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
No, I don't.

396
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Thank you!

397
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Thank you!

398
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
As expected!

399
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Here's inside and there's another two!

400
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
As expected!

401
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
As expected!

402
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000

410
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Congratulations!

411
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Alright!

412
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Alright!

413
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Alright!

414
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Alright!

415
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
High Tension!

416
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Long time no see!

417
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Long time no see!

418
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I'm going to skip this year!

419
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
You're going to skip this year?

420
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
It's over!

421
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
You're so high-tension from the start!

422
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Are you okay?

423
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Do it more!

424
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Do it more!

425
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Do it more!

426
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Do it more!

427
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I'm tired.

428
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
You're tired, aren't you?

429
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Your fingers are like this.

430
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
You're tired, aren't you?

431
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
You're tired, aren't you?

432
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
You're tired, aren't you?

433
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
You're doing well crispy!

434
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Thank you very much!

435
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
From Tanjiro Mitsubishi for steps gift from you,

436
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Nakano Shivasu!

437
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Does he work out?

438
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:33,000
Does he work out?

439
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
He says bad things now...

440
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Does he?

441
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
He says bad things now...

442
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
So I'm going to skip a page!

443
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I'm done with the eggs!

444
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
When the egg is finished, the chicken won't come out.

445
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
When the egg is finished, the chicken won't come out.

446
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I remembered.

447
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
When the egg is finished, the chicken won't come out.

448
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I don't understand the feeling of the egg.

449
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
When the egg is finished, the chicken won't come out.

450
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
I don't understand the feeling of the egg.

451
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Spanish.

452
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Spanish.

453
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Spanish.

454
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Spanish.

455
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I remembered.

456
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Cabs.

457
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Cabs.

458
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
What?

459
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Cabs.

460
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
What?

461
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
I don't understand the feeling of the egg.

462
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Thank you very much.

463
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Thank you very much.

464
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Thank you very much.

465
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Amazing.

466
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:59,000
It's good.

467
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Everyone.

468
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
This is not the end.

469
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
The person who stands at the top will appear.

470
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
It's good.

471
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Let's go.

472
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
This week's number one is...

473
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:23,000
This week's number one is...

474
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
208 points.

475
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
It's Kuwabara Kuwabara.

476
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Yamasaki Hose.

477
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Congratulations.

478
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
You are very good.

479
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
You know that, don't you?

480
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Well then, Yamazaki-san, you're in first place.

481
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I've prepared a pair of socks for you.

482
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Here you go.

483
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Yes, please play it.

484
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Yes, congratulations!

485
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
You're in first place!

486
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Well, isn't this something everyone is looking forward to?

487
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
That's right.

488
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
It's something everyone is most proud of.

489
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Here you go.

490
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Are you okay?

491
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
No, I don't feel like I'm okay.

492
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:23,000
But from here, I'll use my power to take you to the first place, Kokoro-e.

493
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Well then, please stand by.

494
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
This is really...

495
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
You were in first place last time too, right?

496
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Yes, this...

497
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Really?

498
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Of course not!

499
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Who are you?

500
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Well then, let's go.

501
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:50,000
This week's first place, Yamazaki Hosei, is Fuwabara Fuwabara!

502
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
What is this?

503
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Ah, it doesn't matter.

504
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:01,000
That was when I debuted and had my second live performance.

505
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Let's go to the next one!

506
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:11,000
I'm going to take away your itchiness!

507
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
I'll protect you! I'll protect you!

508
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:29,000
I'll take away your itchiness! I'll protect you!

509
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
I'll protect you!

510
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:50,000
I'll take away your itchiness! I'll protect you!

511
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
That didn't work.

512
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Thank you very much!

513
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Well then, let's go to the next one!

514
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
I'm in first place too.

515
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
No?

516
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Yes.

517
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
How easy is it?

518
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Spotlight.

519
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Spotlight?

520
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:24,000
This program was brought to you by these sponsors.
