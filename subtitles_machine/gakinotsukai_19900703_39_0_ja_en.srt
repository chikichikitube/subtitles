1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Ladies and gentlemen.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Ladies and gentlemen.

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Today, we don't have an opening.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
We don't have an opening.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Why?

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Why don't we have an opening today?

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
We're doing all kinds of silly things.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Today, we're going to smoke a cigarette.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
On Sunday, at 3 o'clock on Sunday,

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
at the east...

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
was it Honkan?

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
West Honkan.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
We're going to smoke a cigarette at West Honkan.

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
If you want it, come get it.

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Kyo-san came.

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Why?

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Because I was there.

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Why weren't you there?

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Why didn't you come when I asked you to?

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Everyone was waiting in line.

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
What?

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
No, no, no.

23
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
What's wrong?

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Everyone told me to come dressed as a cat.

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Really?

26
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
They only said, meow, meow.

27
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Everyone said, meow, meow.

28
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
That's right.

29
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Spring is coming.

30
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I thought it was funny.

31
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I was making a stuffed animal last night.

32
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I thought, I'm going to wear a cat costume tomorrow.

33
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I spent the whole night making it.

34
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Don't make fun of me.

35
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I didn't see that coming.

36
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I woke up in time.

37
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Come on, let's go.

38
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm going to wear a cat costume.

39
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
You don't have to wear it.

40
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Run until I tell you to.

41
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I ran like a cat.

42
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I was eaten by a dog.

43
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
You don't have to wear it.

44
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Bring me the monitor.

45
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
The monitor.

46
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I got an offer.

47
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
If it's too much, let's make it a lottery.

48
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
So I went to the store.

49
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
If I get a golden ball, I'll eat it.

50
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Let's take a look at the people who won.

51
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
You don't have to wear a cat costume.

52
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:35,000
But I'm doing it right.

53
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:48,000
It's like a cat's eye.

54
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I just came out like this.

55
00:02:50,000 --> 00:03:05,000
What are you doing?

56
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Let's have a lottery before smoking.

57
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Camera, please shake it.

58
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:26,000
The person who said to wear a cat costume on Sunday at 3 o'clock is here.

59
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
You're stupid.

60
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
It's a very nice day on Sunday.

61
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Why did you come here?

62
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
What time did you come today?

63
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I came at 3 o'clock.

64
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
What time did you come today?

65
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
If I get a golden ball, I'll smoke.

66
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
It's white.

67
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Bye-bye.

68
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:05,000
It's a loss.

69
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
It's a loss.

70
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
What's a loss?

71
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:19,000
It's a loss.

72
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:25,000
You even have a hanger on your face.

73
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:31,000
You're so loyal that you're a little angry.

74
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:37,000
This is the beginning of the date course.

75
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
That's not a cat.

76
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
You're going to get hit or not.

77
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I made it myself.

78
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
What do you think of this dough?

79
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
It's okay.

80
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
It's okay.

81
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
It's fast.

82
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
It's a loss.

83
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I don't like it anymore.

84
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I don't like it anymore because I'm a cow.

85
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Thank you very much.

86
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Good luck.

87
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
It's a loss.

88
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
It's a loss.

89
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:25,000
If you get a golden ball...

90
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I'm editing this, but it's finally out.

91
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:35,000
It's a loss.

92
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,000
That means I have to take you home today.

93
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Are you ready to take it home?

94
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Where is your house?

95
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Kawasaki.

96
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

97
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Thank you very much.

98
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I'll take you home.

99
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Thank you.

100
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
It's a loss.

101
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I made it.

102
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
It's a loss.

103
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:24,000
It's a loss.

104
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
It's a loss.

105
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Isn't that obvious?

106
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I won!

107
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I don't know.

108
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Do you take this train?

109
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
It's a loss.

110
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I don't know how to answer this

111
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
This is definitely a smelly foot

112
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Did you see that?

113
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:25,000
You're not a good staff

114
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
What is it?

115
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
What is it?

116
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
What is it?

117
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
What is it?

118
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
What is it?

119
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
It's a bicycle.

120
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I can't believe it.

121
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I can't believe it.

122
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
There's still a squid inside.

123
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Is this a slipper?

124
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
That's right.

125
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Thank you very much for the nice shoes.

126
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Thank you very much.

127
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
That's all.

128
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I went on a train.

129
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
The bus was hard too.

130
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
It was nothing.

131
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Nothing.

132
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Just like that.

133
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I brought it here.

134
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I brought it here.

135
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I brought it here.

136
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I brought it here.

137
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I brought it here.

138
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I brought it here.

139
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I brought it here.

140
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I asked them to send me a picture of me wearing it.

141
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I wore it.

142
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I put my clothes in it.

143
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
You use it like this.

144
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Like this.

145
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
It's the worst.

146
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I put my clothes in it.

147
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
You don't smell it because you're not close.

148
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
If you put it on a train, you'll look like that.

149
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
It smells so bad.

150
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
The lobby was so smelly.

151
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
It smells so bad.

152
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I think men will understand.

153
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Why?

154
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
It smells like pee when you don't wear clothes.

155
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
It smells like pee when you don't wear clothes.

156
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
It smells like pee when you don't wear clothes.

157
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
That's all.

158
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
The commercial is back.

159
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I'm glad.

160
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
You're a child user.

161
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I'm a child user.

162
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
It's been a long time since I started this program.

163
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
It's been a long time.

164
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
It's been a long time.

165
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
What's going to happen to this program?

166
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
It's going to be hard.

167
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Every time I talk, I don't think about anything.

168
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
There are many people who think that I'm having a meeting.

169
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I don't think about anything when I talk.

170
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I always talk for an hour.

171
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I edit it.

172
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
It's been about 20 minutes.

173
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,000
If you let me talk, I can talk for five minutes.

174
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Sometimes, I take a break.

175
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
There are times when you say things that you can't broadcast.

176
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I can't do that.

177
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I can't do that.

178
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I don't know if you just said that to him.

179
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Let's study the broadcasting code.

180
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I don't study.

181
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I don't study.

182
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I don't know how you do that.

183
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I can't say that.

184
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I don't get it!

185
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Which TV station has a chinko that you can just play on?

186
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
What about a chinko?

187
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
No...

188
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
No, I can't do that!

189
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I can't do that!

190
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
It's a chinchin, right?

191
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Is a chinchin okay?

192
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I don't mind if you call me a chinchin, but if you call me a chinko, I'll be shocked!

193
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
If you call me a chinchin, I'll be shocked!

194
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
What are you talking about?

195
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Don't talk for so long!

196
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
This is only 20 minutes!

197
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
It'll be a waste.

198
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
But broadcasting is really hard, right?

199
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Yes, that's right.

200
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
It'll get worse, so I won't be able to talk.

201
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,000
But if you call me a chinchin, I'll be shocked!

202
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Right?

203
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Like a chinchin?

204
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Yes.

205
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
That's okay, right?

206
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Yes!

207
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I want you to do that.

208
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
This show...

209
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Hey!

210
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
You have to cut a lot of scenes, right?

211
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
The other day, I was surprised.

212
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Yasu-san was like BAM!

213
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
That was...

214
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I was watching it at home, and I was sweating.

215
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Yasu-san wasn't watching it, but other people were watching it.

216
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Yes, yes, yes.

217
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
If it was a chinchin.

218
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
That's right.

219
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
It's scary.

220
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
There are a lot of seniors in Yoshimoto, right?

221
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Yes.

222
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
So you have to be careful.

223
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
That's right.

224
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
There are about 250 seniors in Yoshimoto.

225
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Yes.

226
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
So I can't say bad things about them.

227
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Yes, yes, yes.

228
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I don't know where they watch it.

229
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
You talk bad about people too much.

230
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
You've never said bad things about them, but you can't.

231
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
That's not true.

232
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I'm going to cry if I hear bad things about you.

233
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Really.

234
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
That's not true.

235
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
You say bad things about me, too.

236
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
That's another story.

237
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
No, no, no.

238
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
That's just the way you say it.

239
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
You're a senior.

240
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
That's just the way you say it.

241
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
No, no, no.

242
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I've never said bad things about you.

243
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
That's not true.

244
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
There are a lot of bad things about you.

245
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
But it's in front of you, but it's not in the shadows.

246
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Wait.

247
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
What?

248
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
There are a lot of bad things about you.

249
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
You're bad.

250
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
You're bad.

251
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
What?

252
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
There are a lot of bad things about you.

253
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
But it's in front of you, but it's not in the shadows.

254
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
That's not true.

255
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Why?

256
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
What?

257
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Why?

258
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
You're the best.

259
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Okay.

260
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
But it's in front of you, but it's not in the shadows.

261
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
How many years has it been since you came into this world?

262
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Okay, I'll say it again.

263
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
What?

264
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
You don't have long hair on your earlobes.

265
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
You shave your beard when you shave your beard.

266
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Does this have anything to do with you?

267
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I'm always worried about this because it's an accident.

268
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
It's hard to shave my beard.

269
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
What are you going to do?

270
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Does this have anything to do with you?

271
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
You sometimes have a bad beard.

272
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I told you so.

273
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
What are you going to do about my beard?

274
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
It stinks.

275
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
That's not true.

276
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I know that you have a long beard.

277
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I'm so angry.

278
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
That's not true.

279
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
What?

280
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Don't shave your beard.

281
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
What are you going to do?

282
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
What are you going to do?

283
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:31,000
You've been angry for a long time.

284
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Tell me.

285
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Don't put a microphone here.

286
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Damn it.

287
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
What are you going to do about my beard?

288
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Do you want to go to the toilet?

289
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Please come out.

290
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
You're a bunny girl.

291
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Why are you dressed like this today?

292
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Do you have a job like that?

293
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
What's wrong with you?

294
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Mr. Hiroko Suzuki is 22 years old and he is a party companion.

295
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
He used to work for Marui.

296
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
That's true.

297
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Why did you quit?

298
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I don't like it.

299
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Did you have an affair with your boss?

300
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
No.

301
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Is that so?

302
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
That's right.

303
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Is that so?

304
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I always ask you.

305
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Please tell me which one you like.

306
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I'm not popular these days.

307
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Which one do you like?

308
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Mr. Hamada.

309
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Thank you very much.

310
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Thank you very much, too.

311
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Let me introduce the story.

312
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Mr. Matsumoto says that Hamada's sister is ugly.

313
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Mr. Hamada is smiling and doesn't seem to be angry.

314
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
What about the real thing?

315
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
It doesn't matter if it's ugly or not.

316
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I'm a comedian.

317
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
It's cool to say that.

318
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
What do you think?

319
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
It's a difference in human aesthetic sense.

320
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
It's ugly.

321
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
But I don't care about that.

322
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I don't like it.

323
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I can't go home because I don't like it.

324
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
The internet is bad.

325
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
If you go back to Osaka, you don't want to be called a housekeeper.

326
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Everyone in the neighborhood is watching.

327
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I can't go home.

328
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I don't want to be called a housekeeper.

329
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I don't want to be called a housekeeper.

330
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
You don't know anything.

331
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
You're the one who says that.

332
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I don't want to be called a housekeeper.

333
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I don't care.

334
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
You say it yourself.

335
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
What?

336
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
You're poor.

337
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Your father is weird.

338
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
That's not good.

339
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
My father gets angry when I go home.

340
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
He'll be angry if you say that.

341
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
But I'm poor.

342
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I don't care about being poor.

343
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
My sister is poor, too.

344
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
She got divorced once and bought a new car and ran an electric car.

345
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
If you say that, your sister won't be able to stay at home.

346
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I feel sorry for her.

347
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I'm glad she bought an electric car and ran an electric car.

348
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Why?

349
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
It's true.

350
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
How many times do you say that?

351
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I didn't have an electric car.

352
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Even if you didn't have an electric car, you don't have to say you brought it with your sister's car.

353
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,000
When I got an electric car, my family was amazing.

354
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
When I got an electric car, my family was amazing.

355
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
It's true.

356
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
It warms your cold heart.

357
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
That's right.

358
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
When my father came home in winter, he tried to get inside.

359
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Get out of my way.

360
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Don't look down on me.

361
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I'm looking down on you.

362
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
What?

363
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I'm serious.

364
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Let me introduce this person.

365
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Miki Hatanaka from Saitama Prefecture.

366
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Maki-chan.

367
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Yes.

368
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Last week...

369
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
No. I watch it every week.

370
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
I watch it every week.

371
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Let's get down to business.

372
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Have you ever been told that you two look alike?

373
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Please tell me.

374
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I think you two look alike.

375
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Hama-chan is Fumiya from the Checkers.

376
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
You guys, don't talk to me.

377
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
You always do that.

378
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I can win against you.

379
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I...

380
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:50,000
When I wear a hat like this, I look like a monster.

381
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
You should be happy to get hit.

382
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
That's what I've been told.

383
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
That's right.

384
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
When I do this, I look like a monster.

385
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Your ears are big.

386
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Don't say that.

387
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
But you look like a monster.

388
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I don't say that I look like a monster.

389
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Really?

390
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
How about you?

391
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Hama-chan is Fumiya from the Checkers.

392
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Mach-chan is a cockroach.

393
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Don't you think I look like an insect like a cicada?

394
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I've been told that I look like an elephant or a rabbit.

395
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
You're the worst.

396
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
What kind of cockroach do you think you look like?

397
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
It's just what I saw.

398
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I don't know what other people think.

399
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I think you look like something better.

400
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
If I've been told that I look like something,

401
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I would say...

402
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Watanabe Ken.

403
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
You've been told that, right?

404
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I think I look like...

405
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I don't know who else I look like.

406
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I think I look like Rasaru Ishii.

407
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
There are many people who look like you.

408
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
You look like Fujiko Fujio.

409
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Why?

410
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I'm serious.

411
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
That's enough for today.

412
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I'm tired.

413
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:27,000
What do you want me to say?

414
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
What do you want me to say?

415
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
What do you want me to say?

416
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
What?

417
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
The standard language?

418
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
What?

419
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
The standard language has always been spoken.

420
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
It's always been spoken.

421
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
There's no such thing as spoken.

422
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
The standard language...

423
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,000
This is the standard language of our standard language, right?

424
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
That's right.

425
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I'm still trying to speak properly.

426
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
That's right.

427
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Osaka people will never change.

428
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
No matter how long it takes.

429
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
We have a policy.

430
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
No matter how long it takes.

431
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
If you say something like that,

432
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
you'll get a runny nose, right?

433
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I'm telling you.

434
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
You know...

435
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
The other day...

436
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
What?

437
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
You have to ask Leopard.

438
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
You have to ask Leopard.

439
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Tokyo has only one word.

440
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
That's right.

441
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
The word that changes to that is...

442
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
That woman.

443
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
That woman.

444
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
That woman.

445
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
That woman?

446
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
This one?

447
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Tokyo?

448
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
That woman.

449
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
There are only two words.

450
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
There are only two words.

451
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
In Osaka, it's that woman.

452
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
That woman.

453
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
That woman.

454
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
That woman.

455
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
That woman.

456
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
That man.

457
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
That woman.

458
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
That woman.

459
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
That woman.

460
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
That's all.

461
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Yes.

462
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
It's getting hot.

463
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Let's go to a cool place.

464
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Let's go to a place where we can listen to the radio.

465
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
We'll listen to the radio.

466
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
We'll listen to the radio.

467
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
We'll talk a little next week.

468
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,000
If I sweat a little, I'll go home.

469
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
You say it's hot.

470
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
You say it's cold.

471
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I'm serious.

472
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Let's do it in a cool place.

473
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Everyone can work well.

474
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
That's right.

475
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
That's right.

476
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Thank you for coming.

477
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Really.

478
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
I couldn't help it.

479
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
What do you mean you couldn't help it?

480
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Were you sleeping?

481
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
No, no, no.

482
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
What are you talking about?

483
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
If I say it, it's going to be a long ending.

484
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
I don't think I should say it.

485
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
No.

486
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
It's going to be a long ending.

487
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
No.

488
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
I just wanted to read it.

489
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
It's delicious.

490
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
It's my favorite place.

491
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
I don't smoke.

492
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
I smoke.

493
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Is that so?

494
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Yes.

495
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
I used to smoke a lot when I was in high school.

496
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
That's right.

497
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
I don't smoke.

498
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Thank you for listening.

499
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Let's do it again.

500
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
I don't smoke.

501
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:42,000
I don't smoke.
