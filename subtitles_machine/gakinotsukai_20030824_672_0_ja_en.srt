00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
...

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hello!

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
You haven't done any talk shows for a while, right?

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
That's right!

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
You've done a box game too.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
The audience was wondering if you were going to do more talk shows.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
They were wondering if you were going to do more talk shows.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
You didn't have any reaction when you came out.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I'm counting on you.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I'm not in the mood at all.

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
You're not in the mood at all.

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
What's going on?

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm not in the mood at all.

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Did you go home?

15
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I think so.

16
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
But we're getting paid.

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
That's not the problem.

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Let's work hard in the back of our minds.

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Let's work hard in the back of our minds.

20
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Let's work hard in the back of our minds.

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
This program is brought to you by the sponsor you see.

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
It's been a while.

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
You've been abroad, haven't you?

24
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
You have a lot of money.

25
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
It's nice, isn't it?

26
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
No, I went to Okinawa.

27
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I went to Okinawa.

28
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Is that so?

29
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
That's right.

30
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
There was nothing around me.

31
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
So I stopped thinking about it.

32
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
But it was a great success.

33
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The typhoon came.

34
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
The typhoon came directly.

35
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
That's right.

36
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
So I went to Okinawa to borrow a video.

37
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I said, I'm not from the main island of Okinawa, so I can't lend it to you.

38
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
What are you talking about?

39
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I know your face.

40
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I can't lend it to you.

41
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The manager isn't here, so I can't lend it to you.

42
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:42,000
So I borrowed four videos from the girl I was looking for.

43
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
That's right.

44
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Did she lend it to you?

45
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Yes, she did.

46
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I went to Okinawa to borrow a video.

47
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
It was my first day in Okinawa.

48
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I thought it was fun.

49
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
My phone rang.

50
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
What are you talking about?

51
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I don't like it at that time.

52
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I know.

53
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I don't like it when my manager calls me.

54
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
That girl was playing with me.

55
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
She was playing with my feelings on purpose.

56
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Her tone was low.

57
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Her tone was low.

58
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I said, hello.

59
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
She called me.

60
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Hello.

61
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I know.

62
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I know.

63
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I know.

64
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I'm sorry to interrupt.

65
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Yes.

66
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Friday is...

67
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
What?

68
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
What is it?

69
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
What is it?

70
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Nothing.

71
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I asked her.

72
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
What is it?

73
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
What is it?

74
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
What is it?

75
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
What is it?

76
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
When I got the call, she said it didn't matter.

77
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
You should have told me earlier.

78
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
You should have told me earlier.

79
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
You should have told me earlier.

80
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
You should have called me.

81
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
It didn't matter.

82
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
It was the same for me.

83
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I was excited.

84
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
You didn't call me when you were off.

85
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I didn't.

86
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I didn't.

87
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
You didn't call me.

88
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I didn't.

89
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
When I was off, I got a call from my coordinator.

90
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
That's mean.

91
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
She was looking at me.

92
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Yes.

93
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
What is it?

94
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I really want you to stop.

95
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Right?

96
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I really want you to stop.

97
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
There are times when I'm on a public show.

98
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I'm having fun talking, but the manager is like...

99
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
What is it?

100
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
What is it?

101
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I want to hear it quickly.

102
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I want to hear it.

103
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I want to hear it.

104
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
There must be something.

105
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
There is.

106
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I know.

107
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I totally get it.

108
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I'm getting goosebumps.

109
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
That's my fault.

110
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I'm sure it was on purpose.

111
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
That's right.

112
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
When did you come back?

113
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Where did you stay?

114
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
That's what I asked her.

115
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I asked the coordinator.

116
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I brought her here.

117
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
That's right.

118
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I asked you to keep this a secret.

119
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
What is it?

120
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Let's just keep it open.

121
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
What is it?

122
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I don't know who you're dating.

123
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
It has nothing to do with me.

124
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I can't get married.

125
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
That's how it is.

126
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
It has nothing to do with me.

127
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
That's what I did.

128
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Don't say things like that when you're on vacation.

129
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I really hate talking to you on the phone.

130
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
That's not good.

131
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
It was on purpose.

132
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Where did you go?

133
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I went to Gamue.

134
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I went to Okinawa and Gamue.

135
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Did you have fun?

136
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
No, because I was on vacation.

137
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
It was terrible.

138
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
The hotel was out of power.

139
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
The weather was terrible.

140
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
You couldn't go outside.

141
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I couldn't.

142
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I asked if I wanted to go to a movie theater.

143
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I didn't go to a movie theater.

144
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
There was no subway.

145
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
When the typhoon came, the traffic would stop.

146
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I couldn't move.

147
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I couldn't move.

148
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
It was terrible.

149
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
That's why you're on vacation.

150
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
There's nothing to do on vacation.

151
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I see.

152
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
There's really nothing to do.

153
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
There's nothing to do.

154
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Hamada...

155
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Hamada is...

156
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
He has a occupational disease.

157
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
What are you talking about?

158
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Tell me clearly.

159
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I'll tell you.

160
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
He has a occupational disease.

161
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
He was peeing.

162
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
An old man came to him.

163
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
He said,

164
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Hey!

165
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
He said,

166
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Hey!

167
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
In the bathroom at the station.

168
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Yes.

169
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
He kept saying,

170
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Hey!

171
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Hey!

172
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
But I know that.

173
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I really know that.

174
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
The other day,

175
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I went to a ramen shop.

176
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
It was a fast-moving ramen shop.

177
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
There was no alcohol.

178
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
There was no smoking.

179
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I ate and went out.

180
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
It was a fast-moving ramen shop.

181
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I was eating ramen there.

182
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
There were four old men.

183
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
There were four old men.

184
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Four old men came.

185
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Excuse me.

186
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
There were four old men.

187
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
They came.

188
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Then the clerk said,

189
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
If there are four old men,

190
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
It's impossible to eat at the same time.

191
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I'd like you to sit away from me.

192
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
He said,

193
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Hmm.

194
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I see.

195
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I'll sit away from you.

196
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I'll sit away from you.

197
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I'll wait for you.

198
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
What?

199
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Did the four old men line up?

200
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
If you can't eat, just go to sleep.

201
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
It's been 22 years.

202
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
What?

203
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
What is that?

204
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
What is that?

205
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
It's a good name.

206
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Then I'll wait for you.

207
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
What?

208
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I'm really surprised.

209
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
You're all stupid.

210
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
You have a bad feeling.

211
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
If you don't talk,

212
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Don't go to a ramen shop.

213
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
That's right.

214
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
That's right.

215
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
That's right.

216
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
That's right.

217
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
That's right.

218
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
That's right.

219
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Then I'll wait for you.

220
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
You have a bad feeling.

221
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
That's a great word.

222
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
It's a counter.

223
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
When I was a kid,

224
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I was hiding from my parents.

225
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I bought Shishimai.

226
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I asked Mr. Matsumoto.

227
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Please tell me about your touching encounter with Shishimai.

228
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
And sad parting story.

229
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
It was when I was in the third grade of elementary school.

230
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
When I was in the third grade of elementary school,

231
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I was playing catch ball.

232
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
In the park.

233
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Yes, yes, yes.

234
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
My opponent was a weak guy.

235
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
There was a stick flying.

236
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I said,

237
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

238
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I went to get it.

239
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I found the ball in a place like Kusamura.

240
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I thought,

241
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I found it, I found it.

242
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Katakatakata.

243
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Katakatakata.

244
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
In a cardboard.

245
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
About this much.

246
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Katakatakata.

247
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
It was thrown away.

248
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
It was thrown away.

249
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
There were four of them.

250
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
There were four of them.

251
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
But the others didn't say Katakatakata.

252
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
It was like half-open.

253
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Only one was Katakatakata.

254
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Katakatakata.

255
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
That was the encounter.

256
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
That was the encounter.

257
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I took one of them home.

258
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
You took one home.

259
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
What happened to the other three?

260
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
What?

261
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
The other three were dead.

262
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Really?

263
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
There was only one left.

264
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
When I held him in my arms,

265
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
he didn't say Katakatakata.

266
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I wondered why.

267
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
The two little men were like this.

268
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Oh, that's what it was.

269
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
And the old man was with them.

270
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Snacks are always...

271
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I have a question for Mr. Matsumoto from Disco.

272
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Yes?

273
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
What happens if a child doesn't get a snack even once?

274
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
This is...

275
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
That's right.

276
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Usually, you give them snacks, right?

277
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Yes.

278
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
When they're little.

279
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
We were chosen.

280
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
What was chosen?

281
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Whether to give them snacks,

282
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
or whether to give them allowance.

283
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I was asked by my mother once.

284
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I see.

285
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I said, it doesn't matter.

286
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Now that I think about it...

287
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
But if you give them to a child,

288
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
they're going to be chosen soon.

289
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
That's right.

290
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Whether to give them allowance,

291
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
or whether to give them allowance.

292
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
That's about it.

293
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I gave them allowance.

294
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Is that so?

295
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Yes.

296
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Is it okay to talk about the four sisters?

297
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
If there's another chance.

298
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
We were talking about snacks.

299
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I'm saying this because I couldn't give them snacks.

300
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Their life won't change that much.

301
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
That's okay.

302
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I see.

303
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
That's okay, but...

304
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
They'll definitely...

305
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,000
They'll probably walk with a cold on their shoulders.

306
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Does that mean they'll slip?

307
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
No, they won't slip.

308
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Will their attitude change?

309
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
It's not that they'll change.

310
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
For example, if they're a salesman,

311
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
and the child grows up to be a salesman,

312
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
they'll still do the massage properly.

313
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
It's a service business.

314
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I see.

315
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Is that okay?

316
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Yes.

317
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Thank you.

318
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I'll do it again.

319
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
When I said that,

320
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
just a little...

321
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Just a little bit.

322
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Just a little bit.

323
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
That's enough.

324
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
It's okay.

325
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
It's okay, but...

326
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
You don't have to worry about it.

327
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
That's right.

328
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
That's right.

329
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
That's right.

330
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Also,

331
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
if I had to choose,

332
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I'd be in front of a confectionery shop

333
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
and do a Poiste.

334
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I'd definitely have a sense of presence.

335
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Well, I feel like I understand.

336
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Well, isn't that okay?

337
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
That's about it.

338
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Yes.

339
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Yes.

340
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
This is a question for Onmyoji Matsumoto-san,

341
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
the comedian of the comedy world.

342
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Please tell us the easiest way

343
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
to chase a fox when it's tired.

344
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Ah.

345
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Do you know that?

346
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
What?

347
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Do you know the story of a mosquito?

348
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
A mosquito?

349
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
It's a mosquito.

350
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
A mosquito?

351
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
A mosquito.

352
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Do you know the story of a mosquito?

353
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I don't know.

354
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Do you know it?

355
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Do you know it?

356
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
No, I don't know it.

357
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
There's a thing called a bee.

358
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Oh, I see.

359
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
It's something like this.

360
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I see.

361
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
It's a machine.

362
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
You put a battery in it.

363
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
When you listen to it,

364
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
it makes a sound.

365
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
It makes a sound.

366
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
When it makes this sound,

367
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
the skin doesn't come close.

368
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I see.

369
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
What is this sound called?

370
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
This is the sound of a male's skin.

371
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I see.

372
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
And it sucks the blood of a female's skin.

373
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
At that time,

374
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
the female's skin wants to reject the male's skin.

375
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
It's the season.

376
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
It's the season.

377
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
So,

378
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
you're convinced.

379
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Do you know it?

380
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Do you know it?

381
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Is that a male's skin?

382
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
That's right.

383
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
When it makes a sound,

384
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
you think there's a male's skin,

385
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
but the female's skin doesn't come close.

386
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I see.

387
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
People don't suck the male's skin.

388
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I see.

389
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
That's right.

390
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
They're all females.

391
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I see.

392
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
If you think about it,

393
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
the male's skin is killed because of the female's skin.

394
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
It's just...

395
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
It's just flying.

396
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
The skin is open.

397
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Bang!

398
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
It's being killed.

399
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I'm not a male!

400
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I see.

401
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
It's the worst.

402
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
If it's the female.

403
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
It's said in the human world.

404
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
That a man gets hurt because of a woman.

405
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I see.

406
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
That's it.

407
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
When a fox catches it.

408
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
It's simple, isn't it?

409
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Yes.

410
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
We're going to get into the main subject.

411
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
That's right.

412
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
After all,

413
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
when a fox catches it,

414
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Because it's not a fox, it takes over, right?

415
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
The fox thinks it's a human being, so it takes over.

416
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Right?

417
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
The fox doesn't take over the fox.

418
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Ah, I see.

419
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
That means,

420
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
It's better to say,

421
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
It's better to say,

422
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
It's better to say,

423
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
It's better to say,

424
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
It's better to say,

425
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Then, I understand how to not take over.

426
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,000
But, I want you to teach me how to chase after a fox when it gets tired.

427
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Ah, I see.

428
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
And the easiest way.

429
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
You're saying that it's better to say,

430
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
It's better to say,

431
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
It's better to say,

432
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
It's better to say,

433
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
It's better to say,

434
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
It's better to say,

435
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
It's better to say,

436
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
It's better to say,

437
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I'll take you home.

438
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I'll do it every 20 minutes.

439
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I'll do it every 20 minutes.

440
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I'll do it every 20 minutes.

441
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
But, if you don't do it,

442
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
If you don't do it,

443
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I'll get in trouble.

444
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
But, if you don't do it,

445
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I want you to teach me how to chase after a fox when it gets tired.

446
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Ah, I see.

447
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I want you to teach me how to chase after a fox when it gets tired.

448
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
You're not saying it.

449
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I want you to teach me how to chase after a fox when it gets tired.

450
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Ah, I see.

451
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
It's easy, isn't it?

452
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
If you do that, I'll get out of here right away.

453
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
The best thing is,

454
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Ah, I want you to teach me how to chase after a fox when it gets tired.

455
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,000
That's how you get caught by a white snake quickly.

456
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
That's how you get caught by a white snake.

457
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
If you get caught by a white snake,

458
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I think that foxes are dangerous.

459
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Ah, I understand.

460
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
So, how do you get caught by a white snake?

461
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
After all, it's better to make a gap.

462
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
A gap?

463
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Put on pants as wide as you can.

464
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Like Manbo pants.

465
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
If you're wearing slim pants,

466
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
It's hard to get in.

467
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
So,

468
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Please make it short with wide pants.

469
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
If you do that,

470
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I think you'll be able to get in.

471
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Like this.

472
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Pen name Bichibichisan.

473
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:28,000
What makes Dracula so scared of the cross?

474
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I can't read it.

475
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Dracula is a fool.

476
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
He's like a wife.

477
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
He's like Bichibichisan.

478
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
He's not that scary.

479
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
He's really scary.

480
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Dracula.

481
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Dracula's wife is really strong.

482
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I see.

483
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
She turns the table upside down.

484
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
If you turn it upside down,

485
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
No matter how many times you make rice,

486
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
She'll knock it down.

487
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Just now, you were making somen.

488
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Come on! Stop it!

489
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
That's what she said.

490
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
She mistook it for a cross.

491
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
She said she mistook it.

492
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
She said,

493
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Don't read it!

494
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Yoshike!

495
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
It's not Yoshike.

496
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Speak properly!

497
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Yoshiko!

498
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Yoshiko!

499
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Do you know that?

500
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
She's laughing at something else.

501
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
That.

502
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
She's hiding it.

503
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
She's hiding it because she can't read it.

504
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
But you don't like garlic, do you?

505
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I don't like garlic.

506
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Then what is that?

507
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Why don't you like garlic?

508
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
That's because it's easy to eat.

509
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
It's easy to eat.

510
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I'm sorry.

511
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I don't like the light.

512
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I don't like the light.

513
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
It says,

514
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Come home in the morning.

515
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
It's already morning!

516
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
You'll get scolded by your wife!

517
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
You'll get scolded by your wife!

518
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
So it's Mitsuko?

519
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
It was Yoshiko.

520
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
It was Yoshiko.

521
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I was shocked.

522
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I was shocked.

523
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
She said,

524
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
You!

525
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
She said,

526
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
You!

527
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I understand.

528
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
The light is coming home in the morning.

529
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
That's right.

530
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Then what about garlic?

531
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
What do you mean by garlic?

532
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
You said it yourself.

533
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Ah, garlic.

534
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
You don't like garlic?

535
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
No, it's like,

536
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
It's coming out.

537
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Ah, I see.

538
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I understand.

539
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
What is that?

540
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
That is,

541
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I simply don't like it.

542
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I'm a little bit bad at it.

543
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Even if I put out garlic,

544
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I'm not that scared.

545
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
What is that?

546
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
It's like,

547
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I put out a huge amount of garlic.

548
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
But it'll take ten hours.

549
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
That'll take ten hours,

550
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I think.

551
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
That's right.

552
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
In the morning,

553
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
you can take your wife's face in the morning.

554
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Even if it's not Dracula,

555
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
I'm scared.

556
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Then anyone will run from me.

557
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Dracula is stupid.

558
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
It's true.

559
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
The wife's fangs are like this.

560
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,000
It's like a saber tiger.

561
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
What are you talking about?

562
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
You'll see your wife go crazy.

563
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
But nothing will happen.

564
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
No, it will.

565
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
If your wife goes crazy.

566
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
You'll die, right?

567
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I won't die, but I'll be your wife.

568
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I hope so.

569
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
No, but if you become the wife of Dracula,

570
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Dracula will have to endure it.

571
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,000
That's what I'm most afraid of.

572
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Pen name, Holiday-san.

573
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Holiday?

574
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:56,000
If you die in the sea, is the question for Matsumoto-san.

575
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Please tell us about the Marimo for a week.

576
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,000
How much do you know about Marimo?

577
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
It doesn't matter how much I know.

578
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:12,000
It's nothing. It's nothing.

579
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
You'll get a phone call.

580
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Who's calling?

581
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
It's just a phone call.

582
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Wow, that's a terrible way of saying it.

583
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:26,000
But I think Marimo is saying the same thing to you.

584
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
I don't know if it's true or not,

585
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,000
but it doesn't matter if you don't see it.

586
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
You'll definitely get a phone call.

587
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
You'll definitely get a phone call.

588
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
I can't do anything right now.

589
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
No, no, no. You'll be busy for a week.

590
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Busy?

591
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Busy.

592
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I'll just sleep.

593
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
But you haven't seen it for a week, right?

594
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
I haven't seen it for a week.

595
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:59,000
You'll definitely get a phone call.

596
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I can't help it.

597
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I can't help it.

598
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
What are you busy with?

599
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
What are you busy with?

600
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,000
First of all, Monday.

601
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Monday.

602
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Yes.

603
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I'm thinking about getting a call tomorrow.

604
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I've been thinking about it all month.

605
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
That's the end of Monday.

606
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
I'll try to get a call tomorrow.

607
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I'm thinking about getting a call tomorrow.

608
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
But I'm not sure if it'll be funny.

609
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:48,000
I've been thinking about it all Monday.

610
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
And on Tuesday,

611
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I was wondering why I was so worried about getting a call.

612
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I don't know.

613
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,000
That's the end of Tuesday.

614
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:14,000
And on Wednesday,

615
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,000
There's a way to get a call.

616
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,000
There's a way to get a call.

617
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I've been thinking about it.

618
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,000
I'll definitely get a call tomorrow.

619
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:34,000
I'm surprised.

620
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
And on Thursday,

621
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:44,000
I'm thinking about getting a call.

622
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
I've been thinking about it all Thursday.

623
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
And on Friday,

624
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:55,000
I've been thinking about getting a call.

625
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
I've been thinking about it all.

626
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
And on Saturday,

627
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:05,000
I'm thinking about getting a call.

628
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,000
And on Saturday,

629
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,000
I've been thinking about getting a call.

630
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:21,000
And on Sunday,

631
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:29,000
I've been thinking about getting a call.

632
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:41,000
I'll be quiet and close my eyes.

633
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Call!
