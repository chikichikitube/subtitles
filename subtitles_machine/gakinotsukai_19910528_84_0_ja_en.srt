1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Let's go!

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Let's go!

3
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Excuse me.

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
You are not alone. You are not alone.

5
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
It's dangerous. Please walk on the sidewalk.

6
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
You are not alone. You are not alone.

7
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:21,000
You are not alone. You are not alone.

8
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:47,000
You are not alone. You are not alone.

9
00:01:47,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I want to play dodgeball 500 to 500.

10
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Tetsu wins!

11
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Tetsu wins!

12
00:02:44,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Tetsu wins!

13
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Tetsu wins!

14
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Tetsu wins!

15
00:03:42,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Tetsu wins!

16
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Tetsu wins!

17
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Tetsu wins!

18
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Tetsu wins!

19
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
It's finally starting.

20
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
This program is brought to you by the following sponsors.

21
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:11,000
It's starting!

22
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I am not going to lose to you!

23
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Matsumoto is the one who is going to be punished!

24
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Don't lose to that rotten Hamada!

25
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Don't lose to that womanizer!

26
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
He's a homo!

27
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I'm a homo!

28
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Good job, guys.

29
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
That's right.

30
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I'm the one who should be thanking you!

31
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I'm the one who should be thanking you!

32
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
That's right!

33
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
That guy was a little bit bad.

34
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
He was a little bit like a scarecrow.

35
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
He was a little bit like a scarecrow.

36
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Now, the game has started.

37
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
30 minutes, Nagachoban.

38
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
First, he passes the ball to Keikai.

39
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
First, Matsumoto's turn.

40
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Matsumoto is shaking.

41
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Now, how is it?

42
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Hamada's turn.

43
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
500 against 500.

44
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Both teams have 100 players.

45
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
The losing team is waiting for the punishment game.

46
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Now, Matsumoto's turn.

47
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Hamada's team hasn't lost yet.

48
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Now, Hamada's team hasn't lost yet.

49
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Now, Hamada's team hasn't lost yet.

50
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Where is Matsumoto?

51
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Where is Matsumoto?

52
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
He passes the ball to Miyoko.

53
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Go, Hamada!

54
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Go, Hamada!

55
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Out!

56
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
100 points for Matsumoto.

57
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
100 points for Matsumoto.

58
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Out!

59
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Hamada passes the ball.

60
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Nice catch!

61
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Now, Matsumoto's turn.

62
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Now, Matsumoto's turn.

63
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Now, Matsumoto's turn.

64
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Nice catch, Hamada!

65
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Matsumoto passes the ball to go back inside.

66
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Matsumoto passes the ball to go back inside.

67
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
He's running!

68
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
He's running!

69
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Who is he going to hit?

70
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
He crosses the line.

71
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
He crosses the line.

72
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
He's going!

73
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Matsumoto!

74
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
He's going!

75
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
He's going!

76
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
This is no good.

77
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Hamada is relaxed.

78
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Matsumoto from Kishu Kaisei makes a goal!

79
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Now he goes back inside.

80
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Go Hamada! Go Hamada!

81
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Let's go!

82
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Hamada is out!

83
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Hamada is out!

84
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
It's almost the end of the game.

85
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
The current number of players is almost the same.

86
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
The game is about to begin!

87
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Hamada is running away!

88
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Out! Out!

89
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Hamada is out!

90
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Kishu Kaisei makes a goal!

91
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Now he goes back inside.

92
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Hamada is relaxed.

93
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Out!

94
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Now Kishu Kaisei makes a goal!

95
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Where is the goal?

96
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Out!

97
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Nice catch!

98
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Hamada is relaxed.

99
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
It's almost the end of the game.

100
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
The current number of players is almost the same.

101
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
The game is about to begin!

102
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
The current number of players is almost the same.

103
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Go Hamada!

104
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Did he score?

105
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
This is the short bound.

106
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
You can't go back.

107
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
You scored directly.

108
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Hamada is saying he scored.

109
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
It's almost the end of the game.

110
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Out!

111
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Matsumoto is out!

112
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
It's almost the end of the game.

113
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Hamada is relaxed.

114
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
The game is about to begin!

115
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
The current number of players is almost the same.

116
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
The game is about to begin!

117
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
The current number of players is almost the same.

118
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
The game is about to begin!

119
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
It's almost the end of the game.

120
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:58,020
Good!

121
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:00,020
How many members are there in your team?

122
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:04,020
24

123
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:10,020
How many members are there in your team?

124
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:12,020
18

125
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:22,020
How many members are there in your team?

126
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:34,020
We won! Congratulations, Hama-chan team!

127
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:40,020
We won! Congratulations, Hama-chan team!

128
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:42,020
There is a graduation album, right?

129
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:46,020
We will take a picture.

130
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:50,020
And we will send it to each otaku.

131
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:56,020
We won! Congratulations, Hama-chan team!

132
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:58,020
Please

133
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:03,020
Congratulations, Hama-chan team!

134
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:11,020
We'll all be wearing a hangezura and ride on a roller coaster!

135
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:17,020
Everyone will be wearing a hangezura, and I will take off my hangezura!

136
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:21,020
We're finally going to reveal our identities!

137
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:24,020
Cheese!

138
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:34,020
A thousand young people gathered in Yomiyuri Land.

139
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:37,020
A day of youth, sweating with two downtown people,

140
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:55,020
and the memories of playing with the ball must have left something in you.

141
00:12:55,020 --> 00:13:08,020
You too, from now on, are our friends. Let's jump out, under the blue sky.

142
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:11,020
Congratulations to the Hamada team that won!

143
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:13,020
The Matsumoto team is not in their right mind.

144
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:16,020
Please look forward to the punishment game.

145
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:19,020
Ladies and gentlemen.

146
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:22,020
Hello.

147
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:23,020
Hello.

148
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:24,020
Nice to meet you.

149
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:26,020
Nice to meet you too.

150
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:29,020
Recently, you know...

151
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:31,020
Many of you are new here.

152
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:32,020
Oh, really?

153
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:34,020
I don't know if that's the case.

154
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:36,020
But it doesn't matter.

155
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:38,020
You know...

156
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:41,020
I'm going to be reborn from today.

157
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:43,020
Is that why your eyebrows are so thick?

158
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:49,020
Yes, that's why my eyebrows are so thick, and I look like a man.

159
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:52,020
But it's kind of gross to have such thick eyebrows.

160
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:53,020
Is that so?

161
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:55,020
That's too much.

162
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:57,020
You look like a man.

163
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:59,020
I'm going to be reborn.

164
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:02,020
It's thick, but it's more beautiful.

165
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:04,020
It's rough.

166
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:07,020
That's what a man's cooking is like.

167
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:09,020
I don't cook.

168
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:10,020
Well, you do cook.

169
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:14,020
Well, I'm going to stop here.

170
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:16,020
What are you talking about?

171
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:19,020
I'm a comedian, so I'm going to tell a lie.

172
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:22,020
I'm going to tell a lie.

173
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:25,020
You're laughing a lot.

174
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:29,020
Even if I'm told a little, people don't believe in the world of TV.

175
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:32,020
There are people who really believe in it.

176
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:34,020
No, there are.

177
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:35,020
I'll tell you why.

178
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:46,020
Last week, after the show, I got a lot of letters from the stars.

179
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:51,020
There was one, and there was a heart sticker on it.

180
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:55,020
When I opened it, there was a picture of a man.

181
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:57,020
It's coming from him.

182
00:14:57,020 --> 00:15:00,020
It's coming from him.

183
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:02,020
How old is he?

184
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:04,020
He's 28 years old.

185
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:06,020
He's the same age as you.

186
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:07,020
He's really chubby.

187
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:09,020
His skin is smooth.

188
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:14,020
I can't stand you anymore.

189
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:18,020
My hobby is making sweets.

190
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:24,020
It's disgusting.

191
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:28,020
Please be my friend.

192
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:30,020
I'm waiting for your call.

193
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:31,020
You crushed it.

194
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:34,020
Let's go to Disneyland or drive.

195
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:36,020
Go, go, go.

196
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:38,020
Don't go, it's a loss.

197
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,020
It's a loss?

198
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:42,020
I'm begging you.

199
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:47,020
I'll make his wish come true.

200
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:49,020
Make it come true?

201
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:52,020
I'll make it come true.

202
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:53,020
Really?

203
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:55,020
It's not going to happen.

204
00:15:55,020 --> 00:16:03,020
But I've been told that if I go to play in Osaka, I'll be taken to the toilet.

205
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:05,020
Is it true?

206
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:08,020
I went to the disco, and the man took me to the toilet.

207
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:11,020
Of course, I'll do it.

208
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:12,020
Are you serious?

209
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:14,020
I went home, took a shower, and cried.

210
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:19,020
Did you get hit?

211
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:21,020
Did you get hit when you took a shower and cried?

212
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:23,020
You're lying.

213
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:25,020
What are you talking about?

214
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:26,020
I don't know.

215
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:29,020
But as a comedian, I want to laugh.

216
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:31,020
I don't know if I'm going to laugh or not.

217
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:33,020
I'll make it clear.

218
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:35,020
I'm facing the camera.

219
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:37,020
What camera are you looking at now?

220
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:38,020
Here.

221
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:39,020
Here.

222
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:41,020
I'll make it clear.

223
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:43,020
I think.

224
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:46,020
You can't say such a thing.

225
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:50,020
You're lying.

226
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:53,020
I'm going to cut here and make a commercial.

227
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:55,020
I'm going to stop here.

228
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:57,020
I'm going to make it clear.

229
00:16:57,020 --> 00:17:00,020
If it ends here, that's what happens.

230
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:01,020
That's right.

231
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,020
I'm absolutely wrong.

232
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:05,020
I can't write a letter like that.

233
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:07,020
I don't know.

234
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:09,020
I can't do that.

235
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:12,020
It's not fun to go on a drive with a man.

236
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:14,020
That's right.

237
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:17,020
But what if you touch me like this?

238
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:20,020
Wait a minute.

239
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:21,020
Wait a minute.

240
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:25,020
Wait a minute.

241
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:28,020
You can't touch your father.

242
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:30,020
I don't know.

243
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:32,020
I don't know.

244
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:33,020
I don't know.

245
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:34,020
I don't know.

246
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:35,020
That's not true.

247
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:37,020
I'm sorry I made a mistake.

248
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:39,020
I don't know either.

249
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:44,020
Everyone says it's funny on TV.

250
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:49,020
Amateurs say things that we can't think of.

251
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:50,020
What?

252
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:52,020
So you can't say it.

253
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:55,020
Even if you're playing alone, you can't say,

254
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:58,020
Today, Mr. Aikada.

255
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:59,020
That's true.

256
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:01,020
It's not the same.

257
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:02,020
It's true.

258
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:04,020
I used to say,

259
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:09,020
I don't usually hang out with my friends.

260
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:12,020
That's annoying.

261
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:14,020
When I asked him, he said,

262
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:17,020
I'll be back soon.

263
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:19,020
He said,

264
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:21,020
I killed him.

265
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:22,020
I killed him.

266
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:24,020
I still have a long way to go.

267
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:26,020
I'm going to bury him.

268
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:27,020
But still.

269
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:29,020
What?

270
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:32,020
I'm worried about him.

271
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:33,020
That's right.

272
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:34,020
He said,

273
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:35,020
Thank you for the meal today.

274
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:36,020
The other day,

275
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:37,020
He said,

276
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:39,020
I'm really close to you.

277
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:40,020
I see.

278
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:41,020
So,

279
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:44,020
I know you're married.

280
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:46,020
I know you're married.

281
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:48,020
But he said,

282
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:51,020
I think you and I live together.

283
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:53,020
So what am I?

284
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:55,020
That's a lie.

285
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:57,020
You're married and you have kids.

286
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:59,020
But I'm eating with you.

287
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:02,020
Today's meal is...

288
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:04,020
I talked to you a lot today.

289
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:05,020
That's right.

290
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:07,020
I'm tired.

291
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,020
What are you doing today?

292
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:09,020
Are you in somewhere?

293
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:10,020
No.

294
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:11,020
That's right.

295
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:12,020
The other day,

296
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:13,020
The other day,

297
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:15,020
I went to the dodgeball game.

298
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:16,020
Oh,

299
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:17,020
You went to the game?

300
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:18,020
Yes.

301
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:19,020
Really?

302
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:20,020
What are you?

303
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:26,020
The princess of the kingdom without a father?

304
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:27,020
No, no.

305
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:30,020
I want to go to a country like that.

306
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:31,020
Oh,

307
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:32,020
You're a princess.

308
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:33,020
You should say that.

309
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:36,020
You should praise her.

310
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:37,020
Thank you very much.

311
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:42,020
Thank you very much.

312
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:44,020
Did you come to the dodgeball game?

313
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:45,020
No.

314
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:47,020
Well,

315
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:51,020
Hamada bought it.

316
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:52,020
He bought it, right?

317
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:53,020
So,

318
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:55,020
After I got home,

319
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:58,020
I couldn't sleep at all.

320
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:59,020
What's wrong?

321
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:00,020
I can't drink well.

322
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:03,020
You can't drink well?

323
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:05,020
There's something going on.

324
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:06,020
What is it?

325
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:07,020
I was 24 years old.

326
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:08,020
I was 18 years old.

327
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:09,020
You were 18 years old.

328
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:10,020
Yes, yes.

329
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:11,020
So,

330
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:12,020
Hamada's team won.

331
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:13,020
Oh,

332
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:14,020
I lost.

333
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:17,020
When I got home,

334
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:21,020
There was no evidence.

335
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:22,020
Did you see it?

336
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:23,020
No,

337
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:24,020
I didn't see it.

338
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:25,020
The staff told me that.

339
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:26,020
I had no choice but to believe it.

340
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:30,020
All the staff are crazy.

341
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:33,020
I know that.

342
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:34,020
I know that.

343
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:38,020
My best friend came out of here.

344
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:40,020
Are you stupid?

345
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:43,020
You're not stupid, either.

346
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:44,020
Let's hear it.

347
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:47,020
I started going to the dormitory in July.

348
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:49,020
The dormitory teacher,

349
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:50,020
There's a dormitory teacher, right?

350
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:51,020
Yes.

351
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:52,020
The dormitory teacher is Matsumoto.

352
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:55,020
The vice-director is Hamada.

353
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:57,020
Really?

354
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:58,020
That's all.

355
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:02,020
Please keep up the good work.

356
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:06,020
Is that so?

357
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:07,020
It's funny, isn't it?

358
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:09,020
I told you a funny story the other day.

359
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:10,020
That's right.

360
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:12,020
That's amazing.

361
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:13,020
You know,

362
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:15,020
B21 Hiromi Ono, right?

363
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:19,020
Hiromi's father and my father are classmates.

364
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:21,020
I found that out the other day.

365
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:22,020
I found it out.

366
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:25,020
We had a reunion after 30 years.

367
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:28,020
That's where I slept.

368
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:33,020
B's father said,

369
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:37,020
My son is B21 Hiromi.

370
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:38,020
My father said,

371
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:42,020
My son is Hamada Dantan.

372
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:46,020
We were like, what?

373
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:47,020
That's right.

374
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:50,020
That's an amazing story.

375
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:54,020
I was really surprised.

376
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:59,020
My father said,

377
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:03,020
Why don't you apply to Marukome, the eighth generation?

378
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:04,020
Can I get in?

379
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:05,020
If I can't get in, that's fine.

380
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:09,020
That's true.

381
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:12,020
If you can't get in, that's true.

382
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:16,020
Don't be upset later.

383
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:19,020
I'll send you two times a month.

384
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:24,020
If you say okay, I'll do it.

385
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:27,020
What should I do?

386
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:28,020
Hello.

387
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:29,020
Hello.

388
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:34,020
Today, you watched the match of dodgeball.

389
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:36,020
This is the result.

390
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:39,020
Next week, I'll show you the penalty game.

391
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:41,020
It was exciting, wasn't it?

392
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:42,020
That's right.

393
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:45,020
Especially Takasu and the staff were excited.

394
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:46,020
Really?

395
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:50,020
They were desperate to remember the number of the ball.

396
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:52,020
If it wasn't that kind of thing,

397
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:53,020
I see.

398
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:55,020
I was very angry.

399
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:58,020
You have the number of the person who came to you.

400
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:59,020
Yes.

401
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:00,020
You remembered that, didn't you?

402
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:02,020
I think I remembered.

403
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:03,020
What number is good?

404
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:05,020
I was told later.

405
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:07,020
I was surprised.

406
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:12,020
Oh, Takasu.

407
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:13,020
Is that so?

408
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:15,020
Yes, really.

409
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:19,020
I was going to ask you after the show.

410
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:22,020
But you seem to be shy.

411
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:25,020
Is that so?

412
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:26,020
Don't be shy.

413
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:29,020
I was wondering if I should ask you.

414
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:32,020
I'll see you next week.

415
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:39,020
Next week is the penalty game.

416
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:45,020
