1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
What are you buying?

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I'm practicing.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
You're going to buy it by piling up?

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I don't know.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I don't know.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
What's wrong?

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Thank you.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
You don't know the players either?

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
You've been playing a lot lately.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Yes.

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
It's about marriage.

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Marriage?

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I'm 34, and I'm 35 in September.

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
You're so old!

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
It's been a long time.

16
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
If I go on like this, in a few years,

17
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'll be living with Master Sakata.

18
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
You're going to be a great man.

19
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
But it'll be like that.

20
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
It'll be like that.

21
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
My body is getting stronger.

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
It's bad.

23
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
My hands are not going up.

24
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
My heart hurts.

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
My body is getting stronger.

26
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
You're so mean.

27
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
You're so mean.

28
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
You're so mean.

29
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
No, no, I'm just kidding.

30
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
For now, I want to know what marriage is.

31
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I've been to other people's weddings, but I've never been there.

32
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
That's right.

33
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I want to know how the bride's family feels through this program.

34
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I think I've experienced that in the heroine.

35
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Yes, yes, yes.

36
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I think it's a problem if you get carried away when you do it someday.

37
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
It's cool.

38
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
It's cool.

39
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
That's not good.

40
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
It's my first time.

41
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Yamazaki.

42
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Mr. Oso.

43
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Mr. Akiyama.

44
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Mr. Akiyama.

45
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Such a friendly person.

46
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
And then,

47
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Well, I'm in a school of the road.

48
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Yes, yes, yes.

49
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I don't have a priest role.

50
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
You're right.

51
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I'm a new actor.

52
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I've watched a lot of men's movies.

53
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I'm very worried about it.

54
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I'm thinking of acting in Hamada.

55
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Why?

56
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
It was a little early.

57
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
But Hamada is the best.

58
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Why?

59
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
It's a good idea.

60
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I have to raise the level of the downtown line.

61
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Why?

62
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Which combination do you want to do?

63
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
No, no, no.

64
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I feel refreshed.

65
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Let's do it right away.

66
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Why me?

67
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Why me?

68
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Let's go.

69
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Hurry up.

70
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Why me?

71
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Thank you very much.

72
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Thank you very much.

73
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Please give them a round of applause.

74
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I'm happy, you can be happy with me

75
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:35,000
We are now going to perform the wedding ceremony of the family of Matsumoto and Hamada.

76
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:41,000
First, we would like to introduce their profiles.

77
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
The bride and groom, please stand up.

78
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Shintaro Hitochi was born on September 8, 1938 in Amagasaki City, Hyogo Prefecture.

79
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:02,000
He was a very spoiled child, and he was always with his mother no matter what he did.

80
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:13,000
However, his personality gradually improved after he entered Shioe Elementary School, and he became a member of the broadcasting club after he entered Taisei Middle School.

81
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:25,000
After graduating from Amagasaki Industrial High School with excellent grades, he enrolled at NSC of Yoshimoto Industrial, and here he showed his talent in 12 parts.

82
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:36,000
He started with Japanese TV program Downtown's Gaki no Tsukaiya Arahen and made many other programs hit, and his position became an immoral one.

83
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I heard that your hobby, billiards, is quite a skill.

84
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:54,000
On the other hand, the bride Masako was born on May 11, 1938, in Amagasaki City, just like the priest Hitoshi.

85
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:03,000
It is said that when she was a child, she was a girl with a round face like a boy, but she was also a child with a childlike personality.

86
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:13,000
He was a popular student in the school.

87
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,000
He was a popular student in the school.

88
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:26,000
He was a popular student in the school.

89
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:32,000
After that, they made great success by using the personality of Masari Otoko.

90
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:39,000
They were active in dramas and songs, and also appeared in the drama, The White Poet.

91
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Their meeting is the same as the meeting of Shioe Elementary School.

92
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:51,000
They became friends in the same class, and they were conscious of each other as friends.

93
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:58,000
After that, they will go to different high schools, but they will meet again in 3 years.

94
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Here, the feelings that they have secretly thought of each other became unbearable, and Hitoshi proposed to Masako, and they were able to celebrate the goal in today's goal.

95
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
It's simple, but I introduced them.

96
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I'd like to ask the audience to give a few words of encouragement.

97
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:30,000
First of all, I'd like to ask Mr. Kenji Suga, the producer of the Japanese TV broadcasting company Hensei-kyoku,

98
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:37,000
and the producer of Gaki no Tsukaiya Arahen in Downtown, to give a few words of encouragement.

99
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I met Hitoshi Shinro 10 years ago.

100
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I told him that I wanted to do a new show.

101
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
We met 9 years ago.

102
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:56,000
And then he became a superstar.

103
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I met Shinro for the first time today.

104
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:07,500
I'm very happy that the point of choosing the wife is the same as the heroine.

105
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:18,000
I feel like I can protect Hitoshi as a mother.

106
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Congratulations.

107
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:27,000
Now, we will have the wedding cake.

108
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Please give them a big hand if they put the knife in the right place.

109
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Now, the bride and groom, the wedding cake is here.

110
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Thank you.

111
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Thank you!

112
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Let's celebrate their good luck and make a toast.

113
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Let's pray for the good luck of the Goryo family.

114
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Cheers!

115
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Please come out.

116
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:20,300
living solution

117
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Finally, the class can start

118
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:33,360
Good bye

119
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:41,200
Let us continue

120
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,200
Now, the bride and groom, please enter.

121
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:49,200
I knew it because I was loved by you

122
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,200
I'm in a great mood.

123
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,200
You're noisy.

124
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,200
You're noisy.

125
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,200
That's good.

126
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,200
Thank you very much.

127
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,200
That was good.

128
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,200
That was really good.

129
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,200
That was good.

130
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,200
Happy birthday!

131
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,200
Happy birthday!

132
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,200
It's the night of the sun.

133
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:55,200
We'd like to start with a few words of celebration and a song.

134
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:59,200
First, we have the bride and groom.

135
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,200
They are the younger generation of Yoshimoto Kogyo.

136
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:05,200
They'd like to say a few words of celebration.

137
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:10,200
Masako-san, congratulations on your wedding.

138
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,200
Congratulations!

139
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:19,200
Masako-san, you are always making jokes and making people laugh.

140
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:25,200
I'm sure you make people laugh by making jokes with Masako-san.

141
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:29,200
But at night, you might be making jokes in bed.

142
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:35,200
I'm sorry to say this, but I'd like to tell you an extra story.

143
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:40,200
About a year ago, I was still working overtime.

144
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:46,200
I was told to help.

145
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:50,200
At that time, I heard the marriage proposal.

146
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:56,200
I'm the only one who heard it, so I'd like to reproduce it here.

147
00:14:56,200 --> 00:15:00,200
It was a Chinese restaurant incident.

148
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,200
It's good, isn't it?

149
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,200
It's really good.

150
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,200
This meatball is a popular dish in the neighborhood.

151
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,200
Really? It's really good.

152
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,200
Ah, the last one.

153
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,200
Kisou-san, eat it.

154
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,200
No, you eat it.

155
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,200
No, Kisou-san, eat it.

156
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,200
No, you eat it.

157
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,200
I'm full, so eat it.

158
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,200
No, I want you to eat it.

159
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,200
I want Kisou-san to eat it.

160
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,200
After two hours.

161
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,200
No, you eat it.

162
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,200
No, Kisou-san, eat it.

163
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,200
Let's get married.

164
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,200
Like this.

165
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,200
Like this?

166
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,200
Like this.

167
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,200
I did it!

168
00:15:38,200 --> 00:16:01,560
【 hair一下子】

169
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,560
It's cold.

170
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,560
Is it cold?

171
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,560
Please just like now

172
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:15,560
The flower that bloomed is still blooming

173
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:21,560
But it's still beautiful

174
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,560
Hey!

175
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:26,560
The three of you are humming together

176
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:30,560
I want to make you happy, you're a slumber

177
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:34,560
You can always smile

178
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,560
Don't cry, don't cry, Samba

179
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:41,560
Don't become a bird

180
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:46,560
Ah, that's the way it is

181
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,560
That's the way it is

182
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:54,560
1, 2, Samba, 2, 2, Samba

183
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:59,560
Oh, oh, oh, Samba

184
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,560
I'm taking a picture of you guys.

185
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:04,560
By the way, you guys are not in the picture.

186
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:07,560
Who is thinking?

187
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:15,560
I'm doing a simulation.

188
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,560
Is it OK?

189
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,560
You can go up to the top and take off your clothes.

190
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:23,560
Masako, you're noisy.

191
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,560
I'm sorry.

192
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:30,560
I'll make a face and make a mess of my head again.

193
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:33,560
Hey.

194
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,560
Hey.

195
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:39,560
I'll get angry.

196
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:43,560
Please stop. Everyone is happy, right?

197
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:47,560
Hey, stop using standard language.

198
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,560
I want you to say it.

199
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,560
Thank you very much.

200
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,560
Thank you very much.

201
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,560
Thank you very much.

202
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,560
Thank you very much.

203
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,560
Thank you very much.

204
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,560
Please give him a big round of applause.

205
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,560
Thank you very much.

206
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:45,560
Now, we would like to have a short interview with the bride and groom.

207
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,560
Thank you very much.

208
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:54,560
First, I'd like to hear some words about your real proposal.

209
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:57,560
So, Matsumoto-san, you go first.

210
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:03,560
Well, the first kiss was after the first stage.

211
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:06,560
After the first stage, the first kiss.

212
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:15,560
At that time, I was glad, I was happy, and Masako came to me.

213
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,560
From the front?

214
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:21,560
Yes. Masako is like Yoshimi Tendo right now.

215
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,560
She is very beautiful.

216
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:27,560
She has the smell of Osaka.

217
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:28,560
Yes.

218
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:29,560
She is beautiful.

219
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:36,560
At that time, I said that I would marry her.

220
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:41,560
Next, if you get married, you will have children.

221
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:49,560
I don't know if I can say this in this seat, but I've already won the award.

222
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:03,560
I'd like to hear your favorite food.

223
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:07,560
Well, I can make truffles.

224
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,560
Truffles?

225
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:14,560
I can make truffles.

226
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,560
You can make truffles?

227
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:17,560
Yes, I can.

228
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:19,560
That's right.

229
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,560
It's a trick, isn't it?

230
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:23,560
Yes.

231
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:32,560
Now, let's welcome the bride's junior, Mr. Yamazaki Hosei.

232
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:38,560
Hitochi-kun, Masako-san, congratulations on your marriage.

233
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,560
Isn't she my junior?

234
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:43,560
But, Masako-san, you are...

235
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,560
Masako-san, you are...

236
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:50,560
You are such a charming person,

237
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,560
a really cute girl,

238
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,560
and really...

239
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:57,560
Thank you for raising me.

240
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:03,560
Ah, in Franklin's words, there are these words.

241
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:09,560
Today is worth twice as much as tomorrow.

242
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:19,560
I've become a bit stiff, but thanks to Hitoshi, who has been living his life seriously,

243
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,560
I've been able to...

244
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,560
I've been able to make this seat.

245
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:28,560
Good morning.

246
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,560
Good morning, you!

247
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:31,560
I know.

248
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:37,560
I know that you are seriously thinking about living from now on.

249
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:41,560
And that this is the real start.

250
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:44,560
Why do you know?

251
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:47,560
Why do you know my feelings?

252
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:53,560
Thank you very much for the speech that was sent to WIT.

253
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:56,560
That's what the company said!

254
00:21:56,560 --> 00:22:01,560
You just say what's written in the book.

255
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:04,560
You even read what the host says.

256
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:14,560
As the host of today's show, I would like to extend my gratitude to the guests who have come today.

257
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,560
Thank you.

258
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:27,560
I am very happy that so many people gathered here for us.

259
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:30,560
I am also very grateful to Masako and her friends.

260
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:35,560
I am very happy that we were able to hold a ceremony like this.

261
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:37,560
You are very happy.

262
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,560
You are not in a good mood.

263
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:42,560
But I have something to say to everyone.

264
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:45,560
You are the ones who need to practice.

265
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,560
I'm actually a hole-in-the-wall.

266
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:55,560
A hole-in-the-wall like this is not suitable for any scene.

267
00:22:55,560 --> 00:23:00,560
Thank you very much for today.

268
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:03,560
Thank you very much.

269
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:20,560
That was good, Masako.

270
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,560
Did you get a second round?

271
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:24,560
I've already taken care of the room.

272
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:27,560
I want to take it off.

273
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:29,560
You want to take it off?

274
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:31,560
Yes, I want to take it off.

275
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:32,560
Then I'll take it off too.

276
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,560
I'm going home.

277
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:37,560
What's wrong, Masako?

278
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:39,560
I'm going home. I'm going to be left alone.

279
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:40,560
You're a loser.

280
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:41,560
I'm going home.

281
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:43,560
Everyone's a loser.

282
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,560
I wonder if I was such a crazy kid.
