1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The 100m freestyle softball competition

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
No rest at all

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
The hidden opponent will be given a softball competition

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
The competition will be so intense that the opponent will be knocked out

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
The opponents are Takashi Sasano, Mr.Malik, and Riki Takatou

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Fee-Fee All-Stars

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Are you serious about this?

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Of course!

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm hungry

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
The youngster is attacking from the beginning of the game

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I thought I would be heavier

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
He's aiming for 100 points and shooting and shooting

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
But, because of the veterans, unexpected happenings also happened.

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
You look tired.

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Ko-san, what happened?

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
When I heard the steps, I was like, gukiii.

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
You're not burning up.

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Currently, they have 12 points with 1 out of 2.

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Will they be able to win with a score of 100?

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
What you say to a diving Titanic?

21
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
residue

22
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
but

23
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:38,000
Fifi All Star's every time touc outer space

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,980
the one on spot last clips

25
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,900
DJ Ko

26
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:46,780
Pe melon

27
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:49,780
It's been a long time since I've seen this.

28
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:50,780
That was good.

29
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:52,780
That was a great shot.

30
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:54,780
The pitcher's hand is getting better.

31
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:59,780
The pitcher wants to change the flow.

32
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:06,780
Inomoto is in the first and second place in the runner-up.

33
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:09,780
The next is Komomo.

34
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:11,780
What is that?

35
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:13,780
What is that?

36
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:15,780
That was dangerous

37
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:17,780
That was dangerous

38
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:19,780
Where is it?

39
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:21,780
It's a two outs

40
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,780
It's a three outs

41
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:27,780
He's trying to get the bat out with a three outs chance

42
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,780
I'm going to do it

43
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:31,780
Ready

44
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:33,780
Go

45
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:35,780
Okay

46
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:37,780
Nice

47
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:41,780
Sasano's error and the 14th point

48
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:43,780
Are you okay?

49
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:44,780
14 points!

50
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:46,780
86 points left!

51
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:52,780
The movement I imagined didn't follow my body

52
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:56,780
I was old and I was like a father in the sports world

53
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:58,780
I fell down

54
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:05,780
I couldn't dodge it. I might have tried to take it.

55
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:07,780
It was too early.

56
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:11,780
Oh, I see. I should have dodged it.

57
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:14,780
I couldn't dodge it. I couldn't dodge it.

58
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:17,780
It was a bit frustrating.

59
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:20,780
And Hamada's first hit of the ball...

60
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:22,780
I'll hit it.

61
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:25,780
And Hamada's ball is in front of him

62
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:27,780
Nice!

63
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:29,780
Let's go!

64
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:31,780
Nice!

65
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:33,780
You can do it!

66
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,780
Nice!

67
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:37,780
Nice!

68
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:39,780
Why did you sing?

69
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:41,780
Let's go!

70
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:43,780
Matsumoto

71
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:45,780
Matsumoto, please!

72
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:47,780
There's only one left!

73
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:49,780
Let's go!

74
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:51,780
Matsumoto continues

75
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:53,780
Thank you!

76
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:55,780
Thank you!

77
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:00,780
Hamada wins with the original timing

78
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,780
Thank you!

79
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:05,780
19 points are in

80
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:13,780
As expected, he can go up to 100 points with just one attack

81
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:17,780
That was a bang

82
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:19,780
OK, Komu-san

83
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:21,780
This is bad, really bad

84
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:23,780
It's out

85
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:25,780
It's out

86
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:27,780
It's out, yay

87
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:29,780
Change

88
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:31,780
What's this?

89
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:37,780
Matsumoto is out on the form and it's a 3 out change

90
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:41,780
The first attack is 19 points off

91
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:45,780
He's out of his mind and is on defense

92
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:47,780
But it's enough.

93
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:51,780
Yes, but we have to finish with the three of them.

94
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:52,780
Finish it.

95
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:53,780
Oh no, oh no, oh no.

96
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:54,780
Nice shot.

97
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:55,780
Nice shot.

98
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:56,780
The back of the first floor.

99
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:59,780
The Gaki no Tsukai team is being protected.

100
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:01,780
The picture is being taken.

101
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:03,780
The ball is being thrown.

102
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:08,780
Fifi All Stars, the battle batter is Takashi Sasano.

103
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:10,780
It's okay, it's not Sasano.

104
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:12,780
Zero-one!

105
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:17,780
Hyakki-chan, do your best!

106
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:19,780
Hyakki-chan, do your best!

107
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:21,780
Good, B-chan, good!

108
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:31,780
I see, he can't wait.

109
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:37,780
Good, B-chan, good!

110
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:39,780
I'll give you a warning!

111
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:41,780
1 point for Sasano!

112
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:43,780
1 point for Sasano!

113
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:45,780
1 point for Sasano!

114
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:47,780
1 point for Sasano!

115
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:49,780
Sasano's shot fly is a one-out.

116
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:55,780
The next batter is an Egyptian talent, Fifi.

117
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:59,780
People say I can do anything with my face.

118
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:01,780
I'm fast, right?

119
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:10,780
Egyptian people wearing baseball uniforms are very rare internationally.

120
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:13,780
I think Egyptians will be surprised.

121
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:19,780
It's the first time in thousands of years that Egyptians have worn baseball uniforms.

122
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:24,780
So when I wore it, I thought it would look good on me.

123
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:27,780
I've been thinking about how to show it.

124
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:30,780
Batta's way of holding the ball is different!

125
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:41,780
Batta's grip is off

126
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:43,780
It's a tie!

127
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:45,780
It's a tie!

128
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,780
It's a tie!

129
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:49,780
Nice serve!

130
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:51,780
Nice serve!

131
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:53,780
It's a tie!

132
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:58,780
The batter is Mr. Marik, the super magician.

133
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:00,780
I don't know this.

134
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:02,780
It's scary.

135
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:04,780
Let's see the ball.

136
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:06,780
Marik seems to be good at it.

137
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:08,780
I don't know this.

138
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:11,780
Look at the ball carefully!

139
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:15,780
Good!

140
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:17,780
Don't throw it away!

141
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:19,780
Good, good!

142
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:21,780
It's coming, it's coming.

143
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:25,780
When I was about to shoot, there was still a ball around here.

144
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:27,780
Huh?

145
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:31,780
On the contrary, it's hard to shoot a slow ball.

146
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:34,780
Look carefully!

147
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:35,780
He's so fast!

148
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:40,780
He's so fast!

149
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:43,780
He's so fast!

150
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:48,780
I experienced it for the first time that I couldn't shoot because I was too slow.

151
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:50,780
I could see it.

152
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:52,780
I was definitely here.

153
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:54,780
I was just hitting the target.

154
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:58,780
I was supposed to hit it, but the ball was still here.

155
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:01,780
I can't shoot such a big ball.

156
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:03,780
This is a bit frustrating

157
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:09,780
After the first round, the score is now 81

158
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:12,780
Something strange has happened to the guest team's bench

159
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:15,780
I can't get out at all

160
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:18,780
Let's go over there and ask

161
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:21,780
Maybe the fiber is...

162
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:26,780
The fiber is gone, Hamada is checking the opponent's bench

163
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:47,400
Sasano-san, are you okay? Do you still have any

164
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:50,400
Are you trying to send death to your enemy?

165
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,400
You don't need to be so cruel.

166
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,400
Are you really okay with this?

167
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:58,400
You're going to be like this forever.

168
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:01,400
You're going to be spinning around in the shopping mall.

169
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:06,400
I'm training my body so hard.

170
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:09,400
I'm not going to ride an escalator.

171
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,400
20 times each.

172
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,400
20 times here, too.

173
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,400
20 times.

174
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,400
20 times.

175
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:18,400
And then I did it 20 times.

176
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,400
So I did it 100 times in total.

177
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:23,400
I'm really good at things like this.

178
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,400
I can do it forever.

179
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:31,400
She's still in good health, so she's going to try again.

180
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,400
Good!

181
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,400
Wow!

182
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,400
Wow!

183
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,400
That's great!

184
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,400
That's great!

185
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:40,400
You can run!

186
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,400
She's trying her best.

187
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,400
It's spring.

188
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,400
What was that?

189
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,400
I can't get over it.

190
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,400
It's like he's taking it easy.

191
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:56,400
Right after this, the danger approaches the pitcher, DJ Ko.

192
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:00,400
The batter is the former high school baseball player, Enzo.

193
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,400
It's a high ball!

194
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,400
Show it high.

195
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,400
It's high!

196
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,400
Nice!

197
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,400
Nice!

198
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,400
That was close!

199
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,400
This is good!

200
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,400
It's okay!

201
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,400
That was dangerous, Endo!

202
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:22,400
You can't hit the pitcher's chest!

203
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:25,400
That was dangerous!

204
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:28,400
Why did I have to win that game?

205
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:32,400
Endo was on the screen.

206
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:36,400
If it was a dodgeball, it would have been a big deal.

207
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:39,400
It was a big deal in baseball too.

208
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:44,400
I do exercise. I do walking.

209
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:50,400
I also play with professional table tennis team.

210
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:54,400
I also play with professional bowling player.

211
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,400
Mr. Endo.

212
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,400
And Mr. Tanaka.

213
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:02,400
After Endo, Tanaka also...

214
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,400
The ball is in the net.

215
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,400
Oh no!

216
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,400
Oh no!

217
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,400
Wait!

218
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,400
I told you not to hit the pitcher!

219
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,400
You shouldn't hit the pitcher!

220
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,400
Is that how Kokoriko is?

221
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,400
The two of them are together.

222
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,400
Right?

223
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,400
And he says, sorry.

224
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,400
But he's not sorry.

225
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,400
There's one more!

226
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,400
It's scary when the ball comes.

227
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,400
So even if it's a little bit,

228
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:38,300
I think that if I keep raising the tension of my feelings, I can reduce the fear.

229
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:44,300
I'm a DJ, so I'm always doing that.

230
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,300
I'm always doing it like this.

231
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:52,300
When you enter the second floor, you will be affected by the fatigue of the defense of FIFI All Stars.

232
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:54,300
Oh!

233
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:56,300
So close!

234
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,300
Stop!

235
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,300
Naemachi!

236
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,300
You almost got it!

237
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:04,300
That was close!

238
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:06,300
It's been 35 years since I played softball.

239
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:10,300
My head is...

240
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:14,300
I'm full of energy, but my body can't keep up.

241
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:16,300
Inomo-chan!

242
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:18,300
Oh no!

243
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,300
It's a serve!

244
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:24,300
That was close!

245
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:26,300
That was close!

246
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:29,300
It was so close!

247
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:34,300
When the fly came for the first time, I couldn't see it because of the sun.

248
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:39,300
I lost my confidence and the rest was completely broken.

249
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:43,300
It's coming!

250
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:45,300
It's coming!

251
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,300
It's coming!

252
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:53,300
I was surprised that the shot was shot from many places.

253
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:59,300
My knees and my hips are hurt. My fingers are all over the place.

254
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:01,300
I'm so sick of it.

255
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:06,300
The same goes for the Gakitsuka team.

256
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:13,300
Yoshinobu, who are you?

257
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:15,300
Yoshinobu, who are you?

258
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:17,300
Why are you so slow?

259
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:19,300
You're going to be exposed!

260
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,300
You're going to be exposed!

261
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:32,300
Both the defense and the offense are exhausted

262
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:38,300
The Gakitsuka team has already finished 5 rounds of the game

263
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:42,300
The enemy is getting tired

264
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,300
Are you okay?

265
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:46,300
I'm really tired

266
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:50,300
Tanaka is the batter

267
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:52,300
Look!

268
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,300
Go, go, go!

269
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:58,300
Go, go, go!

270
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:00,300
Go, go, go!

271
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:02,300
Go, go, go!

272
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,300
Go, go, go!

273
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:06,300
Go, go, go!

274
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,300
Don't push yourself too hard!

275
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:10,300
The second goal is a normal one.

276
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:12,300
But it's a running home run.

277
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,300
Let's go!

278
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:21,300
Even though they lost 13 points in this game, they still have 68 points to go

279
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:28,300
FIFI All Stars, who were being pushed, finally counterattacks

280
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:33,300
The batter is Daniel Carl, who has a strong sense of skill

281
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:37,300
Look at the mirror

282
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:42,300
Carl, fight!

283
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:44,300
Fight!

284
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,300
Ahhhh!

285
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:48,300
Error! Error! Error!

286
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:50,300
Tanaka's error!

287
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:54,300
Tanaka's error caused the runner to lose his balance for the first time on this day.

288
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:56,300
Akira, catch it!

289
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:59,300
The next player is the former idol, Mizusawa Aki.

290
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:01,300
The strong player is here!

291
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:03,300
Fight!

292
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:09,300
With the feeling of being in front of the ball, he desperately tries to catch it.

293
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,300
Nice!

294
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:13,300
Nice!

295
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,300
OK, OK!

296
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:21,300
Next, we have 73-year-old actor, Nobuto Okamoto.

297
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:23,300
Here he comes!

298
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:30,300
Oh, scary!

299
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,300
Dangerous!

300
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:34,300
It's raining!

301
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:40,300
His eyes were so blurry and the wind was so cold.

302
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:44,300
His eyes were so blurry and I thought the ball was coming.

303
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:46,300
I thought, is he going to be okay?

304
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:48,300
I thought, can he see clearly?

305
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:02,300
He caught the ball firmly and got a clean hit.

306
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:10,300
Okamoto is in the first place, Daniel is in the third place, and the two runners are in the same place

307
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:12,300
It's here!

308
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,300
This is bad!

309
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:16,300
This is scary!

310
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:18,300
So I'll go this way

311
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:22,300
This is a little scary

312
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:24,300
Let's go see the ball!

313
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,300
Right after this...

314
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:30,300
It's fallen! It's fallen!

315
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:34,300
Why did you fall here?

316
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:36,300
I want to throw up

317
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:44,300
The former Osomori Rikishi, Taka Toriki, did not expect to be hit with a softball

318
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,300
Taka Toriki

319
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,300
Scary

320
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:58,580
Taka Toriki is also a

321
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:00,580
He fell down!

322
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:06,580
He fell down!

323
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:10,580
He fell down!

324
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:12,580
What are you doing?

325
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:14,580
Why did you fall down here?

326
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:16,580
What happened?

327
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:18,580
What happened?

328
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:20,580
His chin is black

329
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:24,580
I couldn't see it

330
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:26,580
I couldn't see it either

331
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:28,580
What happened?

332
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:30,580
My leg hurts!

333
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:32,580
My leg hurts!

334
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:35,580
My chin hurts.

335
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:38,580
After the shot, your chin...

336
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:42,580
My chin hurts.

337
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:43,580
Are you okay?

338
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:44,580
I'm okay.

339
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:45,580
What happened?

340
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:50,580
My leg... I tried to move forward, but I couldn't, and it fell off.

341
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:56,580
I thought I should have practiced a little bit more, but my legs didn't move forward.

342
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:01,580
I couldn't run, so I just held it.

343
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:08,580
It fell from my chin.

344
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:11,580
Was your chin in the frame?

345
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:12,580
Yes, it was.

346
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:14,580
It fell from my chin.

347
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:17,580
I'm glad I didn't hurt it.

348
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:19,580
The result is a draw.

349
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:21,580
It's a draw.

350
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:23,580
It's a draw.

351
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:25,580
It's a change.

352
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:27,580
I was surprised.

353
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:29,580
He didn't come at all.

354
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:31,580
He's a coach.

355
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:33,580
He doesn't come at all.

356
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:41,580
Looking at the three-time All-Star defense, which is not easy to catch,

357
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:43,580
Hamada has a suggestion.

358
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,580
Let's go!

359
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:49,580
Do you want to call it 50 points instead of 100 points?

360
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:50,580
How many points do you have now?

361
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:51,580
32 points

362
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:52,580
It's getting better

363
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:54,580
Please tell us how it is

364
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:55,580
It's getting better

365
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:58,580
You can't say that

366
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:00,580
It's getting better

367
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:03,580
The team is getting better

368
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:06,580
It's not a high score, it's okay if you lose once

369
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:07,580
Is that so?

370
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:08,580
Yes

371
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:09,580
You're strong

372
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:13,580
I only got one

373
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:20,580
After the game, the strongest batter in Gakitsuka, Endo, shows his skills.

374
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:22,580
Here I go.

375
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:27,580
It went in!

376
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:30,580
It went in!

377
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:34,580
It went in!

378
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:38,580
As expected!

379
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:43,580
It's the first home run of the day where the left fencer is changed to a bigger one.

380
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:45,580
It's a new experience.

381
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:46,580
Nice!

382
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:48,580
You just hit one ball!

383
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:52,580
Nice!

384
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:55,580
That was a good one!

385
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:59,580
Fifi All Stars' biggest problem is...

386
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:01,580
It's a miss!

387
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:04,580
It's impossible.

388
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:05,580
It's a miss!

389
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:07,580
Nice cover!

390
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:09,580
The ball comes.

391
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:11,580
Why does the ball come?

392
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:13,580
Because the person in front of you doesn't stop it.

393
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:20,580
When I was practicing, I was able to get a few shots with Fifi-san, so I thought it was easy.

394
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:22,580
But it's different.

395
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:26,580
When the ball comes to the batter, it's scary.

396
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:28,580
I'm really scared of the ball.

397
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:30,580
But today, Yasutaka-shi...

398
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:32,580
You should have moved a little.

399
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:33,580
Yes.

400
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:40,580
Because I'm at home all the time, I'm 100 steps away from walking on my smartphone.

401
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:45,580
The attack of the third round is also very tiring.

402
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:48,580
The game is getting more and more difficult.

403
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:02,580
The third round is over and the score is 44 points difference.

404
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:04,580
The game is getting more and more difficult.

405
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:08,580
Is it okay to end with 50 points difference?

406
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:10,580
What are you going to do, Justin?

407
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:13,580
I can't give a conclusion yet.

408
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:16,580
You can!

409
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:18,580
You can!

410
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:20,580
And you can't say a word to Marikku.

411
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:22,580
Are you having fun?

412
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:25,580
I'm not tired.

413
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:27,580
I knew it!

414
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:29,580
I knew it!

415
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:35,580
So, if they get 50 points, they win.

416
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:39,380
The remaining 6 points are the real goal.

417
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:41,380
He is very motivated.

418
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:43,380
I'm scared.

419
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:45,380
I'm scared.

420
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:49,380
The 50 points are for the kids.

421
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:52,380
The continuous explosion.

422
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:54,380
Come back.

423
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:56,380
The three of you come back.

424
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:58,380
You can do it.

425
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:00,380
Stop.

426
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:02,380
Return the shot.

427
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:06,380
Finally, there is only one point left.

428
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:07,380
Here!

429
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:09,380
OK, it's the last one.

430
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:11,380
Last!

431
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:13,380
Yes!

432
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:15,380
The last one is a home run?

433
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:16,380
It's close!

434
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:17,380
But it's over.

435
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:19,380
50 points!

436
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:24,380
Thank you very much!

437
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:27,380
Thank you very much!

438
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:29,380
Thank you very much.

439
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:31,380
The pitcher was good.

440
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:32,380
It was good.

441
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:34,380
I just threw it to the last.

442
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:36,380
I can't hit it.

443
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:38,380
I don't have experience in pitching.

444
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:44,380
Let's do it again soon.

445
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:48,380
Next time, let's do it with a thick candy.

446
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:50,720
bin Mostly

447
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:17,320
resignation

448
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:23,320
Even if the world is full of conflict

449
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:31,320
I won't give up with a bright smile

450
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:39,320
The power of the Han, and the power of the Pharaoh

451
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:47,120
Today as well, my spirit won't stop

452
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,720
Even though you lost, you still sang high notes

453
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:56,720
I don't know

454
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,720
I don't have time for this

455
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,720
I want you to teach me how to do it

456
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:02,720
I can't eat anymore

457
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,720
The past episode of the show is being broadcast exclusively on Hulu

458
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,720
《Kyuryu Kensaku》
