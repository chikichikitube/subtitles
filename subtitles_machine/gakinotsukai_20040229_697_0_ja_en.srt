1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
It's the 50th anniversary of Shuku Seitan at Gaki no Tsukai Arai!

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
This is the Heipou no Ikiru Michi Quiz!

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Heipou has lived through half a century this year.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
This is the end of his life.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
He has tried many things this time.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I'd like to give you a quiz from those.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Let me introduce the people who answered.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
This is Mr. Hitoshi Matsumoto!

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Is that what a quiz is all about?

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I don't really want to know about Heipou.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
If I could, I'd like to finish it without knowing.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Well, I'm sorry.

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Next to me is Mr. Yosei Yamazaki!

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
The staff said it was really interesting.

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I see.

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm looking forward to it.

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
This is the person who knows Heipou.

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
That's what I was going to say.

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I don't know if it will reach the audience.

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I don't think it will reach the audience at all.

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Thank you for today.

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Next to me is Mr. Shodo Endo!

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Well, it's been a while since I've had a good time.

24
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I don't know anything.

25
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
And finally, Mr. Naoki Tanaka!

26
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I've been doing Gaki for eight years.

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
It's the day I'm least interested in.

28
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Well, let's have the main character appear!

29
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The world's Heipou is here!

30
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
This program is brought to you by five sponsors.

31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,000
The world's Heipou is here!

32
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Mr. Kaga Takeshi!

33
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Let's do a endurance test to see how many seconds you can endure.

34
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:51,000
This man, who is turning 50 this year, doesn't even have a fraction of his posture.

35
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Next, measure your height.

36
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
First of all, please take the height measurement.

37
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
No, you can't put that in.

38
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
No, I don't need that kind of nonsense.

39
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
It's cold!

40
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
By the way, in the profile he wrote himself...

41
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Excuse me, my height is 160cm.

42
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
What is the truth?

43
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
It hurts!

44
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Do it properly!

45
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:34,000
He said it hurt, but when he tried to lift it up a little higher, he saw the true nature of this man.

46
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
It hurts! You can't crush it like that!

47
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Even if you try to deceive him...

48
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
It's 4cm, right?

49
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
No, it's not 4cm. It's 3.8cm.

50
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Here we go!

51
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Here's the question!

52
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:05,000
After this, Heipo will make an excuse for lying about his height.

53
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
What kind of excuse did he make? Please write it down.

54
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
The lie has been revealed!

55
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
What is this?

56
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
What is this?

57
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
What is this?

58
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Hamada-san.

59
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
No, no, it's a parallel tattoo.

60
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Just say it!

61
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
No, no, it's Shingi-kun again.

62
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Please write it down!

63
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
The lie has been revealed!

64
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
What kind of excuse did he make?

65
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
What did he answer?

66
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Matsumoto-san.

67
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Everyone is deceiving me, right?

68
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Like this.

69
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I see.

70
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Yamazaki-san.

71
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
It happens in the morning, right?

72
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I see.

73
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Endo-san.

74
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Until yesterday, it was 160cm.

75
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I see. It happens in the morning, right?

76
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Tanaka-san.

77
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
56cm and 60cm are the same, right?

78
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I didn't see it at all.

79
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
That happened while we were moving the location.

80
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
The height measurement is definitely wrong.

81
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
It's definitely wrong.

82
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
The height measurement?

83
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
The measurement of Onuma is wrong.

84
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
He hit it like this.

85
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
The height measurement is wrong.

86
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
It's definitely wrong.

87
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
What are you talking about?

88
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
It's okay.

89
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
The measurement of Onuma is wrong.

90
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
It can't be corrected by mistake.

91
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
It can't be corrected by mistake.

92
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
The correct answer is that the measurement of Onuma is wrong.

93
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
The height measurement is wrong.

94
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
That's it.

95
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Even now, you still think that Onuma is wrong.

96
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
That's right. Because it's around 160cm.

97
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Without a doubt.

98
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Komazawa Olympic Park.

99
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
This is where Heipo challenges the track.

100
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
He doesn't care about warming up for a high record.

101
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
First, he runs and jumps.

102
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
He challenges the 100cm height.

103
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
He clears it perfectly.

104
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
And the bar is 5cm higher.

105
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
He changes the record.

106
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
He clears Heipo perfectly.

107
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
The next is the 110m hurdle.

108
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Here, a miracle happens to Heipo.

109
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Ready.

110
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Again.

111
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
You don't need that.

112
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
You don't need that.

113
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I didn't use anything.

114
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
You just stood up.

115
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Here's the question.

116
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,000
After this, how many seconds did Heipo run the 110m hurdle?

117
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Please write it down.

118
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Please stop this.

119
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
This is a hard one.

120
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Let's go.

121
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Everyone, please show your answers.

122
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Ready, go.

123
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Amazing.

124
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
34 seconds, 50 seconds, 50 seconds, 1 minute.

125
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Komazawa is the fastest.

126
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I thought it would be anything.

127
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I see.

128
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
50 seconds.

129
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
50 seconds.

130
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
It's the 50th anniversary.

131
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
That's my opinion.

132
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
No, it's not.

133
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
It's not.

134
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
If Heipo runs it.

135
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
What?

136
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I'm sweating.

137
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
You're sweating.

138
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I'm sweating.

139
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Ready, go.

140
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
You're slow.

141
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I see.

142
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
This is good.

143
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
It hurts.

144
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Are you going to retire?

145
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Retire?

146
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
No way.

147
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
No.

148
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
It's not 50 seconds.

149
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
It hurts.

150
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Look.

151
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
It hurts.

152
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
My left leg.

153
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
It hurts.

154
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
It would be bad if I didn't get it.

155
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
That's right.

156
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
It's scary.

157
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
What?

158
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
It's okay.

159
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
What's wrong with you?

160
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
The correct answer is,

161
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
He couldn't run the 100m hurdle.

162
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
We don't know Heipo yet.

163
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
We don't know.

164
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
We don't know.

165
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I think he can do it.

166
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
It's true.

167
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
It's true.

168
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Let's go to the next question.

169
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I'm going to pick up Zaito.

170
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Pick up?

171
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
What do you mean?

172
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I'm going to pick up three girls.

173
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I'm scared.

174
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
In the city?

175
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I'm scared.

176
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Heipo is going to pick up girls in front of Shinjuku Altamae.

177
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:31,000
What kind of technique will Heipo show us?

178
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
However,

179
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,000
It's been 20 minutes since the start.

180
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
There is no sign of a voice.

181
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I don't know what to do now.

182
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I don't care if you talk to the flow.

183
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Which flow?

184
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Which flow?

185
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Which flow?

186
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
This way?

187
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Either way is fine.

188
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
It's hard to do.

189
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Why?

190
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I'm in a situation where I want you to do it.

191
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Yes.

192
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Yes.

193
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I'm sorry.

194
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Really?

195
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I'm going.

196
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Yes.

197
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I'm sorry.

198
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
What are you sorry for?

199
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I'm sorry.

200
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I'm sorry.

201
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Are you waiting for me?

202
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Yes.

203
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Are you waiting for me?

204
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Yes.

205
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I'm sorry.

206
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Heipo is not being treated at all.

207
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
What will happen after this?

208
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Here's the question.

209
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
It's a quick question.

210
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
What happened to Heipo after this?

211
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
What happened?

212
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
What happened?

213
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
What happened?

214
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
What did you do?

215
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Ayame.

216
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I don't think it's a high-turn.

217
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I'm too nervous.

218
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I'm nervous and under pressure.

219
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
That's wrong.

220
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
What is it?

221
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Ayame.

222
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
What did you do when your leg hurt?

223
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
That's wrong.

224
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
What did you do?

225
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I was in pain.

226
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I didn't tell anyone.

227
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I went home.

228
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
That's impossible.

229
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
What is it?

230
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
What is it?

231
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I was drooling.

232
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I don't think it's like that.

233
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I don't think it's like that.

234
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I don't think it's like that.

235
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I don't think it's like that.

236
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
You're drooling.

237
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I'm not drooling.

238
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
You're like a child.

239
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
What will you do?

240
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I was drooling.

241
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
That's right.

242
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Heipo is 40 minutes after the start of the interview.

243
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I'm having a hard time.

244
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
The atmosphere is strange.

245
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Grandma is making a strange call.

246
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
It's strange.

247
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I'm having a hard time.

248
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I can't do it.

249
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
It's not funny.

250
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
It's not funny that I'm doing it so casually.

251
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
That's funny.

252
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Hello.

253
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Are you going home?

254
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Hello.

255
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Do you know what heipo is?

256
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Do you know what heipo is?

257
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Do you know what heipo is?

258
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Have you ever seen it?

259
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
No.

260
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Why?

261
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Did you think it was Nanpa?

262
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
The reaction to the name is completely different.

263
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Even though heipo failed to catch Nanpa,

264
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
If you use the word heipo of the child's use, you will be shocked.

265
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
That's what he said.

266
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
He suddenly changed his strategy.

267
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
He began to attack with the heipo of the child's use.

268
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Hello.

269
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Do you know what heipo is?

270
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Have you ever seen it?

271
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Don't you know me?

272
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Not at all.

273
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Sorry.

274
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Hello.

275
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Do you know what heipo is?

276
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Don't you know?

277
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Have you ever seen it?

278
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Do you know what heipo is?

279
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
He suddenly changed his strategy.

280
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Do you know what heipo is?

281
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Are you angry?

282
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I don't know.

283
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
You haven't seen it, have you?

284
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
He suddenly changed his strategy.

285
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Do you know what heipo is?

286
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Don't you know?

287
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
It's not as interesting as you think.

288
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I don't have anything in me.

289
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
That's why I can't do it.

290
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I don't have any heipo in me.

291
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I don't have anything in me.

292
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I don't have anything in me.

293
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I don't have anything in me.

294
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I don't have anything in me.

295
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I don't have anything in me.

296
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
The answer is, anyway, a lot of mistakes.

297
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
The correct answer is the child's use.

298
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Please understand the heipo.

299
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I really understood.

300
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Are you a man who doesn't understand?

301
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Next question, please.

302
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
From now on,

303
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Is the amusement park a scream machine game?

304
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
We arrived at the Asakusa Hanayashiki.

305
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,000
This is the most at-home amusement park in Japan.

306
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
The heipo of the world is making a noise.

307
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
The staff is pulling me.

308
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I arrived at the attraction I was looking for.

309
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I can't believe it.

310
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
It's a space shot.

311
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I'm scared.

312
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I'm not really okay.

313
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
There's still a roller coaster.

314
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
That's the last thing I can do.

315
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
What is this?

316
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
What is this?

317
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I don't want to go up or down.

318
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I can't believe it's an amusement park.

319
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I can't believe it's an amusement park.

320
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I can't believe it's an amusement park.

321
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
What is this?

322
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
I'm so angry.

323
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
What is this?

324
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Next question, please.

325
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
This is a quick-fire question.

326
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
After this, heipo is going to do something unexpected.

327
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
What did he do?

328
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I don't know.

329
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
It's been 15 to 20 minutes, right?

330
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Finally, the staff cut it off.

331
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
He was hit by a bottle.

332
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
He was hit by a bottle and got on it unexpectedly smoothly.

333
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
On the contrary, it was really cut off, wasn't it?

334
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
It's not a correct answer just because it's cut off.

335
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
What is it?

336
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I reported it to Mr. Sura.

337
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
He's my friend.

338
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
He's cut off by a man who can win.

339
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Is it a child?

340
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
That's right.

341
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,000
It's a lie, isn't it?

342
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Next question, please.

343
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I don't want to do it.

344
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Why are you scaring me?

345
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
That child is scary.

346
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I'm scaring you.

347
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Let me go somewhere.

348
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
What are you doing?

349
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
You don't have to do it.

350
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Child, get out of the way.

351
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:12,000
The correct answer is that he was cut off by a child.

352
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:18,000
By the way, after 20 minutes of heipo,

353
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I don't want to do it anymore.

354
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Then I'll do this.

355
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I'll do this.

356
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I don't want to do it.

357
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I'm not scared.

358
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I'm scared.

359
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I'm scared.

360
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Next question, please.

361
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I'm scared.

362
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I'm scared.

363
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I'm scared.

364
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Help me.

365
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
I'm scared.

366
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
What is it?

367
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Do it again.

368
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I don't want to do it anymore.

369
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
The correct answer is Yama-chan.

370
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
The correct answer is Yama-chan.

371
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
You don't have any words, do you?

372

Quiz.

391
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:49,000

00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:55,000

00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Scary.

401
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Matsumoto was aiming for a sweet habit of the Heipo

402
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
On the other hand, Yamasaki wrote Hamada

403
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
The two of them answered a lot

404
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
By the way, Matsumoto, Yamasaki, and Tanaka

405
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
All three of them are giving the name of the director of Onoma

406
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Who will get the Heipo?

407
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:47,000
What's inside the box?

408
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000

Up and down?

416
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Nothing has started

417
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000

418
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000

419
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000

422
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Nothing came out

423
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Is it moving?

What's this?

432
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
It's a living thing

433
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
