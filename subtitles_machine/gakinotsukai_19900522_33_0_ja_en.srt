1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday dear Hama-chan!

2
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
The first episode of Gagi no Kikai Arahen! Gekidasu Chikichiki Star Bowling!

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Hey, hey, hey!

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
You know, we haven't really done anything that's really, you know, sports-like.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Yes, yes, yes.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
So today, we have a pair.

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
What? What's good about that?

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
You can throw first, so...

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I have nothing to do with that pair of yours.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Idiot.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
You throw first, right?

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Yes.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Well, I'll throw first, so it doesn't really matter which one you throw first, whatever you throw first, and then, you do the processing.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Oh, I see.

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
And then, we have the players who will go against us.

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Yes.

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
The pros.

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
First of all, we have Namiki Pro.

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Hello.

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
He's right in the middle.

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Nice to meet you.

22
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Nice to meet you, too.

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Today, we're going to have a Star Bowling match.

24
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Is that so?

25
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Yes.

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Namiki Pro is wearing a lot of foundation.

27
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
We're two people, so Namiki Pro needs a partner.

28
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
He's good.

29
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
You have one, right?

30
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Yes, I do.

31
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
This is Nitta Pro.

32
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Nitta and I are a pair.

33
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
This is a foundation.

34
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I can't sleep.

35
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
And...

36
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Yes.

37
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
He's going to explain.

38
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I'm calling him again.

39
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Yes.

40
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
He's going to explain.

41
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
This is Sakariko Pro.

42
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Today, he's going to explain.

43
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
He's telling me to be strict, but...

44
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm worried about how to be strict because everyone is so good.

45
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Do you know how to do it?

46
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Yes, I do.

47
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Do you know how to do it?

48
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Yes, I do.

49
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
How is it?

50
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
This pair and this pair.

51
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
It's a beauty pair.

52
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
It's a beauty pair.

53
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Nice to meet you.

54
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Nice to meet you, too.

55
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Now, let's start the Star Bowling match.

56
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Here we go.

57
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Nitta, please look at the form.

58
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
It's amazing.

59
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
It's pretty good, isn't it?

60
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Yes.

61
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Are you going to throw it to the manager now?

62
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
It went to a good place.

63
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Yes.

64
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Amazing.

65
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I'm better than him, aren't I?

66
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Yes, you are.

67
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
You're looking at it the wrong way.

68
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
It's a mistake.

69
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
This program is brought to you by Sunlux.

70
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:07,000
This program is brought to you by Sunlux.

71
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Don't look at the camera.

72
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
But you're looking at it the right way, aren't you?

73
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Yes, I am.

74
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Now, let's see what Hama-chan is going to do.

75
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I've been listening to it for a long time.

76
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
The score is 71 to 57.

77
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I'm counting on you.

78
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I'll catch up with you.

79
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Hey!

80
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Oh, no.

81
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
What's wrong with you?

82
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Is that a real ball?

83
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Oh, no.

84
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I'm sorry.

85
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
It's a real ball.

86
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
You can't do that.

87
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I don't know.

88
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
It went to the middle again.

89
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Nice ball.

90
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Amazing.

91
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
If you're a man, throw it stronger.

92
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:27,000
What is this?

93
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
How is it?

94
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Oh, no.

95
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
There's a difficult one left.

96
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Let's get a strike quickly.

97
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Why?

98
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
It's a good target.

99
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Nice cover.

100
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Oh, no.

101
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Please give him some advice.

102
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
No, I don't need it.

103
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
It's already broken.

104
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Don't leave it.

105
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Oh, no.

106
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Dutty was very good.

107
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
That's how much it's different.

108
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:22,000
The last one was a great strike.

109
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:28,000
That's all for today.

110
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Thank you.

111
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Thank you very much.

112
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I don't think it's very interesting as a viewer.

113
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
But Mr. Mitsuta did a great job today.

114
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
That's right.

115
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
The two of you were very cool.

116
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Mr. Mitsuta's design was very impressive.

117
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
We won the championship.

118
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Mr. Mitsuta and professional Nitta.

119
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Congratulations.

120
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Girls shouldn't leave anything behind.

121
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,000
It doesn't mean that the line here is twisted.

122
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Mr. Mitsuta is here again today.

123
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Hello.

124
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,000
You're on a TV show.

125
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Be quiet.

126
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Are you all local candidates?

127
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I'm sorry.

128
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
It doesn't matter.

129
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Why?

130
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
You have a lot of sauce on your lunch box.

131
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Of course.

132
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Why?

133
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Bring it to me.

134
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
What are you talking about?

135
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I don't know.

136
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Recently, when you take the Shinkansen, you read the newspaper, right?

137
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,000
But when I read the sports newspaper, I don't know what to say.

138
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Why do you play baseball so much now?

139
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Yes.

140
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Professional baseball.

141
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Is baseball getting more popular these days?

142
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Yes, it is.

143
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Why is that?

144
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Because the sun is strong now.

145
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I wonder why comedians don't treat baseball players like that.

146
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
What do you mean?

147
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,000
If there is a funny joke, I'll drink it the next day.

148
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
It's a great joke.

149
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
It's as great as Matsumoto's joke.

150
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Matsumoto's joke is great.

151
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I think it's as great as the home run and the audience cheering.

152
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I think they use their brains.

153
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
They have a lot of skills.

154
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
That's right.

155
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Why do they treat baseball players and comedians differently?

156
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I get annoyed every day.

157
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Every morning, when I read the sports newspaper, I get annoyed.

158
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I get annoyed.

159
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I get annoyed every day.

160
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I don't want you to get annoyed the day before.

161
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I get annoyed when I'm not in the mood.

162
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I get annoyed when I'm not in the mood.

163
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I don't think that's true.

164
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Do you write the content?

165
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Yes.

166
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
In the conversation?

167
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Yes.

168
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
What do you say?

169
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Matsumoto is going to regret it.

170
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I think it's okay.

171
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Why are comedians so low?

172
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
That's how it is in the entertainment world.

173
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I've been working hard.

174
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
A cute girl with a face like an idol.

175
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I just came out and got angry.

176
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
That's right.

177
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
That's right.

178
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I think it's sad.

179
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
She became a big star.

180
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
She doesn't have any skills.

181
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
She's just cute.

182
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:16,000
If she becomes a big star and appears in front of me, I'll get angry.

183
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
That's sad.

184
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
She's saying hello to the audience.

185
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I'm going to be angry with the audience.

186
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
That's sad.

187
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Comedians are not good.

188
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Even baseball players say good things when they hit the home run.

189
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
When I come home from the home run, I'm angry.

190
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
That's why comedians are not good.

191
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I'm angry because you're not funny.

192
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
You don't have to be angry.

193
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I'm not funny when I'm sad.

194
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:09,000
If I get angry, you'll be angry.

195
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,000
It's not good when you laugh at me.

196
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:21,000
But when I say something, it's a big laugh.

197
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
That's right.

198
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I'm helping you.

199
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
But if the audience sees it, I'll get angry.

200
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Why?

201
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I'm sorry.

202
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
That's not true.

203
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
You're a fool.

204
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I'm not a fool.

205
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
That's not true.

206
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:53,000
If I'm reborn, I don't want to be a comedian.

207
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I don't like baseball.

208
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I don't like baseball because of the rules.

209
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
You're trying to change the subject.

210
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Someone decided to hit the home run three times.

211
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I can't accept that.

212
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I don't know if there's anyone who hits the home run four times.

213
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I don't know if there's anyone who hits the home run four times.

214
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Hit the home run three times.

215
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I don't know if there's anyone who hits the home run three times.

216
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Why do you accept it?

217
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I can't accept what people think.

218
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:46,000
You can't do anything.

219
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
You were doing a bowling experience.

220
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I don't like that.

221
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,000
You don't like it.

222
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I don't like it.

223
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Why are you smiling?

224
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I was saying that.

225
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
It doesn't mean anything.

226
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I said it because I was fast.

227
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I can't do anything because I said it.

228
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I can't do anything because I said it.

229
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:27,000
It's a training for people who need it.

230
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
It's a training for people who need it.

231
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
It's useless in real life.

232
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
It's useless in real life.

233
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Have you ever been a guest next door?

234
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I don't have it, and I don't have to tell you that.

235
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I don't need it.

236
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I don't need it.

237
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I don't need it.

238
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I don't have to tell you that.

239
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I don't have it.

240
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
It's a training for people who need it.

241
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
It's a training for people who need it.

242
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Excuse me.

243
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Is there anyone who eats oysters?

244
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I'll ask the person next door.

245
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
You talk for a long time.

246
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I'll ask the person next door.

247
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I'll ask the person next door.

248
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Please wait here.

249
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I'll ask the person next door.

250
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I'll ask the person next door.

251
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I'm hungry.

252
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Mr. Matsubara came out.

253
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
What kind of person is he?

254
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
He's a fat person.

255
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I have a guest.

256
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
What is it?

257
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I'm eating oysters.

258
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
That's good.

259
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Would you like to eat with the guest?

260
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I'll be told.

261
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I'll be called.

262
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I'll be called.

263
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Then the guest who came first will be excited.

264
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Then the guest who came first will be excited.

265
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Hey, Akagi.

266
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Please come out.

267
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
What is it?

268
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
What's your name?

269
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
My name is Kobayashi.

270
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
How old are you?

271
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I'm 21 years old.

272
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Do you have a boyfriend?

273
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I have a boyfriend.

274
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I just heard it.

275
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I have a boyfriend.

276
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
That's right.

277
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I'm sorry to hear that.

278
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I've been showing off the most until now.

279
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I usually hide it.

280
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I have a lot of friends.

281
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Is that so?

282
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Please cherish your love.

283
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Thank you very much for today.

284
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
It's rare to be so clear.

285
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Let's go to the postcard.

286
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I really like down-down.

287
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Especially Hama-chan.

288
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
He's cool.

289
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Is that so?

290
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Please listen to the story below.

291
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
The program is wrong, but you can laugh.

292
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I'm on a regular Monday.

293
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I'm sure I'll meet you and take a picture.

294
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I pretended to go to school on Monday.

295
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I left the house and took the train.

296
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
I should have taken the Shinkansen.

297
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I live in the countryside.

298
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I didn't know where Alta was.

299
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I couldn't find Alta.

300
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I couldn't find Alta.

301
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
That's why I don't give up.

302
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I took out my savings.

303
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I took out my savings.

304
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I took out my savings.

305
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I couldn't meet Hama-chan.

306
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I couldn't meet Hama-chan.

307
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I didn't know where Alta was.

308
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Please read it normally.

309
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
When I came home, the teacher came.

310
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I found out that I was absent from school.

311
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I had a fight with my parents.

312
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
It was terrible.

313
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
When I went to school the next day, the teacher called me.

314
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
He asked me which was more important, school or downtown.

315
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
When I said downtown, he asked me if I looked down on me.

316
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
He told me to stop going to school.

317
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I just told him the truth.

318
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I'm living a dark life now.

319
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Please give me an old man.

320
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
He told you to stop.

321
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I don't know.

322
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Please give me an old man.

323
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
You're homeless, aren't you?

324
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
You're happy, aren't you?

325
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,000
You've come this far.

326
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Should I send you to him?

327
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I thought about it.

328
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
But there's something like this.

329
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Kuniko Nakai from Yokosuka.

330
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
She's 22 years old.

331
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
She wanted an old man.

332
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,000
She said she was cold.

333
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
She's so pitiful.

334
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
She's cold.

335
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
If she does that, I can't help but get angry.

336
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I heard that the TV show talent wants an old man, too.

337
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
They say that.

338
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
They say that Yukari Morikawa is coming.

339
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
That, too.

340
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
That's why I'm going to do it after I see him.

341
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I see.

342
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
The talent is going to book a seat.

343
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Come and see.

344
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Sit in the audience seat and give it to her after the recording.

345
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
If she wants it, come to the venue.

346
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Don't you want to see it together?

347
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I don't.

348
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
If I see it, I'll give it to her.

349
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I'll give it to you.

350
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:31,000
You are making sacrifices in various ways.

351
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:37,000
It's normal, but it's cold.

352
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
It's difficult.

353
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I don't know which one to choose.

354
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I don't have it.

355
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I don't have two.

356
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
You guys are laughing too much.

357
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,000
You guys are going too far.

358
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I don't have two.

359
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I choose this one.

360
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
It looks good on you.

361
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
You are from Niigata.

362
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:13,000
You don't even go to school.

363
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I'll give it to Minoru.

364
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I choose this one.

365
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I choose this one.

366
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Ichikawa Reiko.

367
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
The ultimate choice.

368
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Is it written here?

369
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Please put it here.

370
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
The ultimate choice.

371
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Which one do you choose to quit?

372
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
You can laugh.

373
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,000
You are a child.

374
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
This is the ultimate choice.

375
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Which one do you choose to quit?

376
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:56,000
You are a child.

377
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Let me tell you.

378
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Which one do you choose to quit?

379
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I choose this one.

380
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Which one do you choose to quit?

381
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Children.

382
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,000
If you are a child, you can do what you want.

383
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Tell me if it's good.

384
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
It's half past ten.

385
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
It's early.

386
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
It's early.

387
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Jamon is next to the big star Junichiro.

388
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I'm watching the newspaper. There's a group of teenagers behind me.

389
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Oh, really?

390
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Yeah.

391
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I'm going in there.

392
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Excuse me.

393
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I can't talk at all.

394
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
You're late.

395
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
That's not true.

396
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
What are you looking at?

397
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
That's not true.

398
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:48,000
You're laughing so hard before the show.

399
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Look at the audience here.

400
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Hey!

401
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Excuse me!

402
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Hey!

403
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
You're not going to say anything.

404
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
This is...

405
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
This is not something we decide.

406
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Oh, my.

407
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
It's that.

408
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
The show is the most important thing.

409
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
We both want to continue.

410
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
But this is...

411
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
This is...

412
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Wait a minute.

413
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Let's move on.

414
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Let's see.

415
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
If you were told to hit one of them, who would it be?

416
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Kiyoshi Nishikawa or Katsura-san?

417
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:29,000
You're late!

418
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,000
How about this?

419
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I'll let you say it.

420
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
So, this one or this one?

421
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Which one?

422
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Let's do it on the count of three.

423
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Wait a minute.

424
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
You're definitely going to do it.

425
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
I'm going to do it.

426
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
So, this one or this one?

427
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,000
I'm definitely going to do it.

428
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Don't betray me like that.

429
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
One, two, three.

430
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
I'm definitely going to betray you.

431
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Let's make it a two-shot.

432
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
I can't let you frame out like that.

433
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:12,000
One, two, three.

434
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Let's just say one more.

435
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Four or five years ago,

436
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
at the Hyokin Yobi High School in Fuji,

437
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,000
when Downtown came out as a regular,

438
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
when Kiyoka Nijiko-san came as a guest,

439
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
it was about a kiss.

440
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
There were two victims.

441
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I think one of them was Mach-chan.

442
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
What do you think?

443
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
That's exactly right.

444
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
That's true.

445
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Kiyoka Nijiko-san kissed him.

446
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
That big mouth.

447
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
That person was amazing.

448
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Really.

449
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Was he a guest?

450
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Well, I still can't forget the feeling of his lips.

451
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:59,000
It was like his skin was rotten.

452
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
That's true.

453
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
It was like a marshmallow.

454
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
That's true.

455
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,000
It was like a marshmallow on his face.

456
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
That's right.

457
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
After I finished filming,

458
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:20,000
I cried in the bathroom.

459
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
You were tricked.

460
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Really.

461
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,000
It was like a shower.

462
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Can you act now?

463
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
That's right.

464
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
I'll start with what I have to do.

465
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Today?

466
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
The other day, I did the chameleon costume.

467
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Yes, yes, yes.

468
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
I said I wanted it,

469
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
so I'm wearing this much.

470
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
So, can you take it off?

471
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Thank you.

472
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
There are many things in it.

473
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
I want the wings.

474
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I see.

475
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
I heard there were many helmets.

476
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
There are no helmets.

477
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
No way.

478
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
There are only the bow and the body.

479
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
No, no, no, no.

480
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Only the body.

481
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
The body is big.

482
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:11,000
It's a 12-dollar soap.

483
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
I've never said that.

484
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,000
It's a 12-dollar soap.

485
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
That's too much.

486
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Let's go with the bow.

487
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
I'll wrap it up and send it to you.

488
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
This is Ayako Tanigawa, 15 years old.

489
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
I'll send it to her.

490
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
I'll write a letter,

491
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
and I'll answer all your questions.

492
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Please send them to me.

493
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
I'll be waiting for you.

494
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
I'll be waiting for you next week.

495
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Goodbye.

496
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
I'll be waiting for you.
