1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
On the day of the recording, there was a sudden change in the atmosphere.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Hama-chan got sick and collapsed.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
So we decided not to record today.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
We decided to make a short film.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
It's hard to talk alone.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Yamazaki...

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I'll do my best.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I was going to do the cleaning in Yamazaki.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
It took only 7 minutes.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
That's a lie.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
It took 30 minutes.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Yamazaki is interesting.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I've been doing it for 7 years.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
What are you talking about?

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
The part of the bat that was suddenly cut by the radio was removed.

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
The radio staff couldn't handle it.

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
What are you talking about?

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I'm sorry.

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'll do it properly in the new year.

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
It was on TV.

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I was surprised.

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Well...

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
We don't have time, so let's play.

24
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Let's go play.

25
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Let's go to Amani.

26
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
We don't have time.

27
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Let's go to Amani.

28
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Everyone is going to play.

29
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Excuse me.

30
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Hama-chan, are you okay?

31
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Okamoto-san is calling me again.

32
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Please come soon.

33
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
It's a lawful way of talking.

34
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
If it's about Hama-chan, I'll hear it on the phone, so it's okay.

35
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I don't care about that.

36
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I don't care about that.

37
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Hama-san is lying down.

38
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I know that.

39
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
It's important that Okamoto-san doesn't come.

40
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Please come.

41
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Please come quickly.

42
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
We don't have time.

43
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I'm sorry.

44
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Let's all work hard together.

45
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
That's what we're going to do today.

46
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
He's going crazy.

47
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Let's go.

48
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I don't care about that.

49
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I don't care about that.

50
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
It's annoying.

51
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
An emergency.

52
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Manager Okamoto is angry again.

53
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Please come soon.

54
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Okamoto suddenly calls out without any intention.

55
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I'm tired of the picture.

56
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I'll be there soon.

57
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I'm tired of it.

58
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I'm tired of it.

59
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
What time is it?

60
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I'm tired of it.

61
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I'm tired of it.

62
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I'm tired of it.

63
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I'm not going to ask you for anything.

64
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I'm going to ask you to bring me there.

65
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
It's still bright.

66
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I'm going to play.

67
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Let's go to Joy Police.

68
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
No, no, no.

69
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I'll be there soon.

70
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
No, no, no.

71
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Please.

72
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
No, no, no.

73
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Let's go to Joy Police.

74
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
No, no, no.

75
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Please come soon.

76
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I'm here.

77
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I'm here.

78
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Suddenly, they are chatting.

79
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Okamoto is waiting for them.

80
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
They are in Odaiba, a trendy spot.

81
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
What will happen?

82
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I'm in a good place.

83
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
It's beautiful.

84
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I'm here.

85
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Where are you?

86
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
What are you doing?

87
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I went straight ahead.

88
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I'm here.

89
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
You are late.

90
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I'm going to stop recording today.

91
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Why?

92
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Hamada is not feeling well.

93
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
We are not together.

94
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
We will stop recording.

95
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
We will stop recording.

96
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
What are you doing?

97
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I'm a manager.

98
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I'm a child care worker.

99
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
What?

100
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
You are not a child care worker.

101
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
No, no.

102
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
You are just talking.

103
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
No, no.

104
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
You can't do anything if I'm here.

105
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
We don't know what's going on.

106
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,000
You guys are doing too much.

107
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
No, no.

108
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I see.

109
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I see.

110
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
What is this?

111
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
What is this?

112
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
This is funny.

113
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
You guys are doing too much.

114
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Yes, yes.

115
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Recently, Isomata.

116
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
People around me are asking me.

117
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
What?

118
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Isomata is funny.

119
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Are you stupid?

120
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
He is funny.

121
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
He is funny.

122
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
What?

123
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Mr. Hamada.

124
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Isomata.

125
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Yes.

126
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Yes.

127
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Yes.

128
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
What is this?

129
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:53,000
This is funny.

130
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
He is funny.

131
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
You guys are doing too much.

132
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Recently, Isomata.

133
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
People around me are asking me.

134
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
What?

135
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Mr. Okamoto is funny.

136
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Are you stupid?

137
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Yes.

138
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
If I'm here, you guys are here too.

139
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
What?

140
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
No.

141
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
But.

142
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Why are you here?

143
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
You don't need to be so serious.

144
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
What?

145
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Don't you have any problems with your breath?

146
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Don't you have any problems with your breath?

147
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
What?

148
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Don't you have any problems with your breath?

149
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Why is this guy funny?

150
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
He was funny.

151
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I'm going to drink this.

152
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Wow!

153
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Amazing!

154
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Good, good, good!

155
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Wow!

156
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
This is the best!

157
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
This is amazing!

158
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Wow!

159
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Ah!

160
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Hey!

161
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Hey!

162
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Are you drunk?

163
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
This is so boring.

164
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
It was good.

165
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
It was good.

166
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
It was good.

167
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I'll show you.

168
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
It was good.

169
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
What was good?

170
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
It was good.

171
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
It was good.

172
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
It was good.

173
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
What is this?

174
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
What?

175
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Is this a iron bag?

176
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I'm going to drink this.

177
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I'm going home.

178
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I'm going to drink this.

179
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I'm going to drink this.

180
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I'm going home.

181
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I'm going to drink this.

182
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Is that Isomata?

183
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Isomata.

184
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
What is this?

185
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
What is this?

186
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Mr. Okamoto is so cool.

187
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
This is as it is.

188
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
This is as it is.

189
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
50,000 bottles.

190
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
50,000 bottles?

191
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
From now on.

192
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
But!

193
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I don't drink like Isomata.

194
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I can't help it.

195
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I'm drinking.

196
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
The amount is different.

197
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
The way to drink is different.

198
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I'll show you now.

199
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
50,000 bottles.

200
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I'm going.

201
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
What is this?

202
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
This is amazing.

203
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
This is amazing.

204
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I'm drinking this all the time.

205
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I'm going home.

206
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Gakimitsu is lined up beautifully like the summit of Banri.

207
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Okamoto's ambition to spread the dream bridge to the stage.

208
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
What is the challenge using Gakimitsu?

209
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
This is amazing.

210
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I'll do this.

211
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I don't know what to do.

212
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I saw it.

213
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I can't say anything.

214
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Okamoto, are you ready?

215
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Yes.

216
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Okamoto, are you ready?

217
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Start!

218
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
It's heavy.

219
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I didn't drink all of it.

220
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Did you understand in one shot?

221
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I didn't drink all of it.

222
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I only drank a little.

223
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
My body hurts.

224
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I want to dance.

225
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I can't walk.

226
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I can't walk.

227
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I'll dance.

228
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I'll dance.

229
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
It's spicy.

230
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Don't say it's spicy.

231
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I'll dance all the way.

232
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I can't dance.

233
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I can't dance.

234
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
What is that?

235
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Okamoto.

236
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
What are you doing?

237
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I don't know.

238
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Why?

239
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I don't know.

240
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I don't know.

241
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I don't know what you're doing.

242
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
That's the face of the viewer.

243
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
That's the face of the viewer.

244
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I don't know.

245
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I don't know.

246
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I can't dance.

247
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I can't dance.

248
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I can't dance.

249
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
It's a triangle jump.

250
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
It's a triangle jump.

251
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
That's amazing.

252
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Why do you think it's that?

253
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Why do you think it's that?

254
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I can't dance.

255
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I can't dance.

256
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Take it off.

257
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Take it off.

258
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Take it off.

259
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Take it off.

260
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Take it off.

261
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I'll wait for you at the goal.

262
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I'll wait for you at the goal.

263
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Are you really waiting?

264
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I'm waiting.

265
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I'm waiting on the way.

266
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
You should go back 100 meters.

267
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I ran a lot.

268
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
You ran a lot.

269
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Around here?

270
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Around here?

271
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
From where the carabiner is.

272
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I don't know.

273
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
It's cold.

274
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
It's cold.

275
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
It's cold.

276
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
It's cold.

277
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
It's cold.

278
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
It's cold.

279
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I'm going home.

280
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Thank you.

281
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Thank you.

282
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I'm going home.

283
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I'm going home.

284
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Ladies and gentlemen.

285
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:40,000
The main squeeze of the airplane will be about to take off.

286
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:54,000
What kind of reaction should I make when I walk down the street and see my girlfriend naked?

287
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
What are you talking about?

288
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Are you from Kanagawa prefecture?

289
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I happened to walk down the street and saw my girlfriend naked.

290
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
What should I do?

291
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I'm 17 years old.

292
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I'm a sticker.

293
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I'm a sticker.

294
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I'm a sticker.

295
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I'm a sticker.

296
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Have you ever done it?

297
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I have.

298
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I have.

299
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I don't.

300
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I'm kind to the earth.

301
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I'm kind to the earth.

302
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Which is more serious, a cigarette or a cigarette butt?

303
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I think it's a cigarette butt.

304
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Why do you say that?

305
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:50,000
You don't have to think about the cigarette butt.

306
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:56,000
You don't have to think about the cigarette butt.

307
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I don't need it.

308
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
If you throw it away.

309
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I don't throw it away.

310
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Where do you throw it?

311
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I throw it on the street.

312
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I throw it on the street.

313
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I throw it on the street.

314
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I throw it on the street.

315
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I've done it in the bathroom in the apartment.

316
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Oh, my God.

317
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I'm in the bathroom.

318
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
You're in the living room.

319
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I'm in the living room.

320
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I'm in the bathroom.

321
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
You don't go straight.

322
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
You don't go straight.

323
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
You don't go straight.

324
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I'm in the bathroom.

325
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I'm in the bathroom.

326
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
This is how it is in the 21st century.

327
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,000
It was broadcast on April 21, 1996.

328
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:02,000
The other day, I was about to sell my beloved car, and as soon as I started looking for a new car, it was a non-trouble car, but it broke down.

329
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Is this a message from God telling me not to sell it? Or have my feelings been revealed to the car?

330
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:16,000
This is definitely a living thing, a car. This is strange.

331
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
You're making a strange face.

332
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
This is strange.

333
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Why are you making a face?

334
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Friends from middle school are nice.

335
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Someone come here!

336
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I think so, too.

337
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Well, I'll help you with that.

338
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Well, that's what I'm saying.

339
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,000
You know, cars are like lovers.

340
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Really?

341
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,000
If you try to buy a new one, something will definitely happen.

342
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Most people are like that.

343
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Haven't you ever felt that?

344
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
For example, what do you mean? Everyone is like that.

345
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
For example, your hair is growing and you can't put it together.

346
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I thought it was annoying, so I thought I'd go to the hair salon tomorrow, but when I woke up the next day, it was pretty clean.

347
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Today, it's easy.

348
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
There is. There really is.

349
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
The hair is telling you not to cut it.

350
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I see.

351
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Don't sell the car.

352
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Yamazaki said something.

353
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Really?

354
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,000
He was in the car, and he was going to the hair salon tomorrow.

355
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,000
He was riding a dirty Rolls-Royce until then.

356
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I said, I'm sorry.

357
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I said, I'm sorry that I'm going to be your friend from tomorrow.

358
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
He suddenly got angry.

359
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Really?

360
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Yes.

361
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
That's a coincidence.

362
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I had a lot of regrets.

363
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
What?

364
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I had a lot of regrets.

365
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Really?

366
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Yes.

367
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Tell me.

368
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
What?

369
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Tell me what happened.

370
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
What happened?

371
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Three days ago, I was riding a car and I was about to turn around and try to wink.

372
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
That's a mistake.

373
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I raised my hand.

374
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I raised my hand.

375
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
The weather was so nice.

376
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
That's a bad habit.

377
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I said, I'm sorry.

378
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
That's a bad habit.

379
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
That's right.

380
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
That's a bad habit.

381
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
That's a bad habit.

382
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
That's a bad habit.

383
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
There is. There really is.

384
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Even machines are living things.

385
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Is that so?

386
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
There is. There really is.

387
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I'm the one who says to take care of things.

388
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Does this mean that your feelings have been conveyed?

389
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Yes.

390
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Even for women.

391
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
If you think about throwing it away, you'll see a good place.

392
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:00,000
You're saying a lot of good things right now.

393
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
But before that, I said, should I throw it away?

394
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
That's also a negative point.

395
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
A broadcast of April 28, 1996.

396
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:15,000
What's inside the sun tower designed by Okamoto Taro?

397
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Do you know about the sun tower?

398
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I think I climbed it.

399
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
What?

400
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I climbed the sun tower with stairs.

401
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Who told you to do that?

402
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
No, no, no.

403
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I was doing it in elementary school.

404
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
There are stairs inside.

405
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Did you climb the stairs?

406
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I didn't.

407
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Let me see.

408
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
You were just listening indirectly.

409
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
No, no, no.

410
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:42,000
There were things like the Mitsubishi Pavilion and the Fuji-Pan Robot Museum.

411
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
The inside was like this.

412
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
What?

413
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,000
It was designed to give children dreams.

414
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:54,000
The inside of the sun tower is internal organs.

415
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,000
What is that?

416
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
What is this?

417
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I don't know what it is.

418
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
It's internal organs.

419
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
What?

420
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
It's not a living thing.

421
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
It's not a living thing.

422
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
What?

423
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
It's not a living thing.

424
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Why is it internal organs?

425
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Why?

426
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
What?

427
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
It's not the inside. It's stairs.

428
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
It's not stairs. It's internal organs.

429
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Why?

430
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,000
You were moving in the past, right?

431
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I'm still moving. I'm not moving.

432
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
You were moving in the past.

433
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
When was it in the past?

434
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
It was in the past, so it was before the bombing started.

435
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I built it because the bombing started.

436
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:49,000
It came because the bombing started.

437
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Where did it come from? I built it.

438
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I don't know where it came from.

439
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,000
If you don't know, you don't know where it came from.

440
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,000
You don't know where it came from.

441
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
This is alive.

442
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
It's alive.

443
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
It's not alive.

444
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
I didn't do it yesterday.

445
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
You said it was concrete.

446
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
No.

447
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
It came when the bombing started.

448
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
It's not alive. You don't have legs.

449
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,500
It's like this, right?

450
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:25,000
Originally, you walk like this.

451
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,000
Why are you wearing such long pants?

452
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:35,000
Why are you wearing such long pants?

453
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,500
That's your hobby, isn't it?

454
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,000
I'll do it for you.

455
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Because it's a pair of boots.

456
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:45,000
Boots are fine, but why are you wearing a pair of pants?

457
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Because it's a pair of boots.
