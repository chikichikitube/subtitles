1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Gakuya is in a peaceful atmosphere. However, he is nowhere to be seen.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I'm already swollen.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I'm not swollen.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I don't think so.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Masubo-san, Masubo-san.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'm sorry.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Okamoto-san suddenly appeared in front of the staff.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I'm sorry.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I'm really sorry.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Are you angry?

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Of course.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
You're angry, right?

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I don't care about that.

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
So I'm not going because I was called.

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Today, Yamazaki is going to Shibagi.

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Let's go.

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
What should I do?

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
You dropped it from your waist.

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I'm a talent.

20
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
That's right.

21
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Until now, he has been dancing in the dark of the night.

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Sometimes he sticks his neck out with a huge blade.

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Sometimes he flies in the sky for bananas.

24
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
And last time, he was under the sky of Selvian Blue in Okinawa.

25
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
He is the strongest man in the entertainment world.

26
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
He is the manager of the company.

27
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
The staff of Downtown Wika arrived at a river in the outskirts of Okinawa.

28
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
This is really good.

29
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Come here.

30
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I'm selling it.

31
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Did he have such a hairstyle?

32
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
What is it?

33
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
What is it?

34
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
It's been a long time since I left Okinawa.

35
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Why don't you tell me anything?

36
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
You don't tell me.

37
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
What is it?

38
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I've been waiting all the time.

39
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
But it's over 20, right?

40
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
It's over 20, right?

41
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
It's over 20.

42
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Why don't you tell me the number?

43
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
You tell me the number.

44
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I don't want to tell you.

45
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I don't want to tell you.

46
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
If you tell me that, I don't know what to do.

47
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I have something I've been wanting to do for a long time.

48
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Do you have something?

49
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Yes.

50
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I have something.

51
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I'm sorry.

52
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Mr. Okamatsu.

53
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Mr. Okamatsu.

54
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Mr. Okamatsu.

55
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Mr. Okamatsu.

56
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Mr. Okamatsu.

57
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Are you serious?

58
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I'm serious.

59
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I'm serious.

60
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Stop it.

61
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Stop it.

62
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Mr. Okamatsu.

63
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Stop it.

64
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I'm begging you.

65
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I don't have any enemies.

66
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I'm begging you.

67
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Your voice.

68
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
It was a serious voice.

69
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I've been wanting to do this for a long time.

70
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Is that so?

71
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
What are you doing?

72
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
What are you doing?

73
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
What?

74
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
What are you doing?

75
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I'll show you.

76
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
What are you doing?

77
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
What are you doing?

78
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Did you see that?

79
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
What?

80
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I'm Inoki.

81
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
This is Muhammad Ali.

82
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Yes.

83
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Right?

84
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I'll fight.

85
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Tohkon Furiko Okamoto Bombaye.

86
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
What?

87
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Tohkon Furiko Okamoto Bombaye.

88
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Manager Okamoto.

89
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Tohkon Furiko Okamoto Bombaye.

90
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I'll fight Okamoto Tohkon Bombaye.

91
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Tohkon Furiko Okamoto Bombaye, right?

92
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
It's the same.

93
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
It's a bit different.

94
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
It's like that.

95
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I know.

96
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:19,000
This program is brought to you by these sponsors.

97
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
What are you doing?

98
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
What are you doing?

99
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
You're amazing.

100
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I want to see it.

101
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I want to see it.

102
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Antonio Inoki.

103
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Okamoto is the strongest pro-wrestler in the world.

104
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
This time, Okamoto was caught by three 30-meter high cranes.

105
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Inoki's eternal rival, Muhammad Ali, who was waiting on the other side, was released like Furiko.

106
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
And the moment he punched, he changed into Inoki.

107
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Okamoto.

108
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
The enemy is over there.

109
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Really?

110
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Don't come to the red place.

111
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
You look like you're angry.

112
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Please let me punch you in the neck.

113
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I'll punch you.

114
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Hey.

115
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
It's you.

116
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I'm sorry.

117
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Are you angry?

118
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I'm angry.

119
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Hey.

120
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
What did you see?

121
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I didn't see it.

122
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I didn't see it.

123
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I saw it.

124
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Everyone saw it.

125
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I'm sorry. I made a mistake.

126
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
What did you see?

127
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I made a mistake.

128
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
What did you see?

129
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I'm sorry.

130
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Wait a minute.

131
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I'm sorry.

132
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I'm sorry.

133
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I don't know.

134
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I see.

135
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
The highest point is 20.

136
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
What?

137
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
It's 30.

138
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
It's 30.

139
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I didn't know you liked cranes so much.

140
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Okamoto.

141
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Okamoto.

142
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Okamoto.

143
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
What?

144
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Are you ready?

145
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Yes.

146
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Are you ready?

147
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Let's go.

148
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Open it.

149
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Okamoto.

150
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
It's time to stop.

151
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
What are you going to do?

152
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I'm thinking.

153
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Are you going to stop?

154
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I'm sorry.

155
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
What are you going to do?

156
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I'm getting scared.

157
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I'm getting scared, too.

158
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
What?

159
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Wait a minute.

160
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Wait a minute.

161
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
You've been talking about cranes.

162
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
What are you doing?

163
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
It's high.

164
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
What?

165
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Wait a minute.

166
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I'm really scared.

167
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
What?

168
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I'm really scared.

169
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
You're scared, aren't you?

170
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I can see the bottom clearly.

171
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Okamoto.

172
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
It's OK now.

173
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
It's OK.

174
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
The setting is complete.

175
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Wait a minute.

176
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Let's go to Okamoto Mountain.

177
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,000
5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

178
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Start.

179
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Bungy.

180
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Bungy.

181
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Bungy.

182
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Bungy.

183
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Bungy.

184
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Bungy.

185
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Bungy.

186
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Bungy.

187
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Bungy.

188
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Bungy.

189
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Bungy.

190
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Bungy.

191
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Okamoto.

192
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Bungy.

193
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Okamoto.

194
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I'm sorry, but I couldn't get the camera.

195
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Okamoto.

196
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
You're the one who got it.

197
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I couldn't get it.

198
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I'm really sorry.

199
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I'm counting on you.

200
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I'm really sorry.

201
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
You took out your underwear, didn't you?

202
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
What?

203
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
What?

204
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Why are you like this?

205
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
You look like a girl in middle school.

206
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I'm sorry.

207
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Please lift it up.

208
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Now, the audience is half and half.

209
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Bungy.

210
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Bungy.

211
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Bungy.

212
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Bungy.

213
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Bungy.

214
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Bungy.

215
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
You know, you're going to go down like this.

216
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
It's really scary.

217
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
It's scary.

218
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
It's scary.

219
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
It's scary.

220
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
It's scary.

221
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
It's scary.

222
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
It's scary.

223
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
It's scary.

224
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
It's scary.

225
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
It's scary.

226
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Okamoto, go down.

227
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
5

228
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
4

229
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
3

230
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
2

231
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
1

232
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Start.

233
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
It's really scary.

234
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
It's really scary.

235
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Okamoto, go down.

236
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
It's really scary.

237
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
It's scary.

238
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Okamoto.

239
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
It's the face when a dog poops.

240
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
It's a little funny.

241
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I'm sad.

242
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
When you first came here, you got eyes, right?

243
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Yes, I did.

244
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I saw you a lot.

245
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Okamoto-san, we'll let you go home now.

246
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
But thank you very much.

247
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Thank you very much.

248
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Thank you for your hard work.

249
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
It's too early.

250
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Okamoto-san, you won't do it five more times after I go home, right?

251
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I won't do it.

252
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Okamoto-san, you won't do it five more times after I go home, right?

253
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Okamoto-san, you won't do it five more times after I go home, right?

254
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
The men...

255
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Oh, really?

256
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
The men in front of you...

257
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
The men in front of you...

258
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
The men in front of you...

259
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
The men in front of you...

260
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
The men in front of you...

261
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
The men in front of you...

262
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I'm really sorry about everyone today.

263
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I'm really, really tired.

264
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Really.

265
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Yesterday, I went home in the morning.

266
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I went home in the morning and...

267
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I thought I should go to bed.

268
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
What's that?

269
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I'm like, da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da!

270
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Ah.

271
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
It's a construction.

272
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
What do you call that?

273
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
That's the thing!

274
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Da-da-da!

275
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
It's that thing, right?

276
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
That's the old man's.

277
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
The old man's?

278
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Well, it's not owned by the company.

279
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
The old man doesn't get angry at all.

280
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
The old man doesn't get angry at all.

281
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
The old man is a good old man.

282
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
No, the old man is doing it.

283
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
But he's just doing it.

284
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
But the old man is switching it on.

285
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
But the old man did it yesterday.

286
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Have you ever talked?

287
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
It's 9 o'clock in the morning.

288
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
That's the time for the old man to work.

289
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Everyone is working at 9 o'clock in the morning.

290
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
You guys are so annoying.

291
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
It can't be helped.

292
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Right?

293
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I'm fine even if I don't get enough sleep.

294
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
But if I do a show like this,

295
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
with my head in a daze,

296
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
in the end, it's going to bother the viewers.

297
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
His nagging is not very useful.

298
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,000
It would be better if you let me sleep and work well.

299
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
It would be good for Japan.

300
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Well, I'm fine with that.

301
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
What are you digging?

302
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
There was a piece of string in my pocket.

303
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I'm worried about it.

304
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Someday, I'll be thrown away like that.

305
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
What are you talking about?

306
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I'll be thrown away like trash.

307
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Are you a woman?

308
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
No, it's really hard.

309
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I'll do my best.

310
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
But it's just...

311
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Most of the time,

312
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I'm at work.

313
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
You're talking about yourself again.

314
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Most of the time,

315
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
with my head in a daze,

316
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
without any meetings,

317
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
the two of us are talking.

318
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
When I hear that,

319
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
it's a miracle.

320
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
When I think about it,

321
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I can't think normally.

322
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Your voice is getting louder.

323
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Right?

324
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
It's your proud face.

325
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
What's wrong?

326
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I'm scared because I can do it.

327
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Stop it.

328
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I'll do my best.

329
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I'll do my best.

330
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I didn't shave my beard.

331
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
That's fine.

332
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I've gained a lot of weight lately.

333
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
You're...

334
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
You're hiding

335
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
my secret.

336
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
You're revealing it!

337
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
You're revealing it too much.

338
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Don't touch me.

339
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I'm telling you what I saw.

340
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Who are you telling that to?

341
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I'm curious.

342
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
It's fine.

343
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Come on in.

344
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
That was funny.

345
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
After this,

346
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
come with me.

347
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I'm sorry.

348
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I can't believe it.

349
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I was surprised when I saw the picture.

350
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
The poster was cut.

351
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I was walking in the alley.

352
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I was wondering what was going on.

353
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I went out and saw

354
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
a poster of Maekawa Kiyoshi.

355
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
He was sticking his face

356
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
to the poster.

357
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I was wondering what was going on.

358
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I thought it was fine.

359
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I went into the alley again.

360
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
When I went back,

361
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I saw Maekawa Kiyoshi again.

362
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
That was funny.

363
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Your wife must have been old.

364
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
She must have been ugly.

365
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
If I was really

366
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
going to get married,

367
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
I would choose someone like that.

368
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I'm serious.

369
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Marriage is not about appearance.

370
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
It's about staying together.

371
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
What do you mean by staying together?

372
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Your father is weird.

373
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
He's already gone.

374
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
He's already gone down.

375
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
He's trying to go back.

376
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
He's trying to go back to his father.

377
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
If you put a CCD on your neck,

378
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
it will be like this.

379
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
It won't look like this.

380
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
It won't look like this.

381
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I think it's fine.

382
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Your wife will take good care of you.

383
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I know what you mean.

384
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Your wife will take good care of you.

385
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
It's hard to find a wife who doesn't get married.

386
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
It's not like that.

387
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
It's not like that.

388
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
It's not like that.

389
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
It's not like that.

390
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
It would be nice if you could be a heroine.

391
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
You can't do that.

392
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I'll do it properly.

393
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
What will you do?

394
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I'll do everything from start to end.

395
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I'll do this and that.

396
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Let me do it.

397
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Why are you doing that?

398
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Are you trying to cry?

399
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
No.

400
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Why am I the one who's trying to cry?

401
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
You're so stubborn.

402
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
You're the one who's trying to cry.

403
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
No.

404
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
You're like a monk.

405
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I'm like this.

406
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
If you two fight, I'll go to you.

407
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Even if you cry,

408
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I don't want you to cry.

409
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I don't want you to cry.

410
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Why?

411
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Why am I the one who's trying to cry?

412
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Why am I the one who's trying to cry?

413
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I like people who cry.

414
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I like people who cry.

415
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I like people who cry.

416
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
You don't have any connections.

417
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
There are many diet rules.

418
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
There are many diet rules.

419
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
The Matsumoto diet

420
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
is to lose 17 kg in 3 days.

421
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I heard that.

422
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
What are you going to do?

423
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Normally,

424
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
if you write it in a book,

425
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
it's easy to sell.

426
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
It's easy to make money.

427
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
I don't want to make money dieting.

428
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I don't want to make money dieting.

429
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I don't want to make money dieting.

430
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Can you clap for me?

431
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
You're tired.

432
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I don't want to make money

433
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
by doing that.

434
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,000
I'm fat.

435
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
They're telling me to do the big lunch.

436
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
They're telling me to do the big lunch.

437
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I told you how to lose 17 kg in 3 days.

438
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I told you how to lose 17 kg in 3 days.

439
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I don't want to make money.

440
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I don't want to make money dieting.

441
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Do you?

442
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
At home,

443
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
you have a knife.

444
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I have a knife.

445
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
If I had one,

446
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
What?

447
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Can you do that?

448
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
What do I do?

449
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Can you be a model?

450
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Sure.

451
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
You can use a knife.

452
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
You go like this.

453
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
And you cut all the edges.

454
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
You cut it?

455
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
You cut it.

456
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
How deep?

457
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
About 1cm deep.

458
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Make it deep.

459
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
How deep?

460
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
About 1cm deep.

461
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
You go around it.

462
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
And you grab it like this.

463
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
If you go like this,

464
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
you can pull it out from the spine.

465
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
How do you pull it out?

466
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Wait a minute.

467
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
If you pull it out,

468
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
does that mean you don't need it?

469
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
What?

470
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I don't understand what you're saying.

471
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
What happens if you pull it out?

472
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
If you pull it out, it stays as it is.

473
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Where does it stay?

474
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Where does it stay?

475
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
If you put it in a box, it stays in a box.

476
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
No, no, no.

477
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
From here,

478
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
the spine is connected, right?

479
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Yes, yes.

480
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Where does it stay?

481
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Where does it stay?

482
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:11,000
If you put it in a box, it stays in a box.

483
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Where does it stay?

484
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I don't know.

485
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
I don't know even if you ask me.

486
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
It's already over.

487
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
When you pull it out,

488
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
what's over?

489
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
It's from now on.

490
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Why is it from now on?

491
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Rather, it's from now on.

492
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Why?

493
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
That's weird.

494
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
It's weird.

495
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
It's weird.

496
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
I think there are only two weird points.

497
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,000
It's weird that you pull it out like this.

498
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Then why didn't you tell me at that time?

499
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I want to ask you the rest of the story.

500
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Then you're in the same boat.

501
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
What?

502
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Who is that man in the soup spa?

503
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Who is it?

504
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,000
I'm the most angry man in the world right now.

505
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
What kind of guy?

506
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Do you want to have a soup spa?

507
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
I'll tell you clearly.

508
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
He's very narcissistic.

509
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Maybe.

510
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Why are you so angry?

511
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Do you want to have a soup spa?

512
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
You're always angry.

513
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
You always say,

514
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
let's have a soup spa.

515
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Why are you doing this?

516
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I don't understand the meaning of that.

517
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
What is a soup spa?

518
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
In the car,

519
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
soup spa.

520
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
He's very cool.

521
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
It's rare.

522
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
I don't know if he's a model.

523
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I don't know if he's a model.

524
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Recently, when he comes out, he goes home.

525
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
When he comes back, he comes out again.

526
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
It happens.

527
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I don't like it even if it's like this.

528
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
When he comes back, it's just around here.

529
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
It happens a lot.

530
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
It's about to happen tomorrow.

531
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
It's about to happen tomorrow.

532
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
If you're going to use it like that,

533
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
I really don't use it.

534
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I only use it once.

535
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
I only use it once.

536
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
It's a little better than that.

537
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Why?

538
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Because you get angry and go home.

539
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Because you get angry and go home.

540
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
But even if I say,

541
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
let's have a commercial,

542
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
a windmill will come.

543
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Why do you want a windmill?

544
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Why do you want a windmill?

545
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
A commercial for a book store.

546
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,000
What?

547
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
You'll get angry if you go to a commercial.

548
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
I won't get angry.

549
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
You'll be late, you'll be early. You shouldn't get angry on the set.

550
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:00,000
You're the one who says that, so I won't be a bad guy anymore.

551
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
You're the one who's bad.

552
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Oh, really?

553
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,000
You're the one who's always got an iron rod.

554
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Is that really a rumor?

555
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
No, it's not me. It's downtown.

556
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
What are you talking about?

557
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
The other day, Mr. Takeda, from GX.

558
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Mr. Takeda, Mr. Tetsuya.

559
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Mr. Tetsuya came, didn't he?

560
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Yes, yes, yes.

561
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Well, downtown is...

562
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
What?

563
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:35,000
He's always got a stick in his hand when he's playing golf.

564
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
What?

565
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Why is that?

566
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Well, the staff is hitting him.

567
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
He's got a stick in his hand.

568
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Well...

569
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Why is it so low?

570
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:54,000
It's your hexagon, so it hurts.

571
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
I don't have it.

572
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
It's my circle, so it hurts.

573
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:16,000
In the end, they're both bad guys.
