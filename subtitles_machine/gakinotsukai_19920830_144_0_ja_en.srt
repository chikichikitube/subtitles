1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Watch this!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Watch this!

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
This is the first time we have a kid's show!

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Chiki Chiki GENERATION!

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Are you really that good?

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
There are a lot of GENERATION members in the entertainment world.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Are you really that good?

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
You're hiding it, but you're actually that good, right?

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
We want people to see that.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Like Okama?

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Yes, Okama.

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Okama this time...

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I should have said Okama.

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Do you know a lot of them?

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Well...

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Don't say it.

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
First, we have Mr. Kenji Nagira!

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Hello!

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm sure you know a lot of GENERATION members.

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
There are a lot of GENERATION members who have secrets they can't tell, right?

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Yes.

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'll do my best.

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Next, we have Mr. Tenmei Kano!

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Hello.

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Tenmei, you know a lot of things, right?

26
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
A little bit.

27
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
This time, we have Mr. Matsumoto!

28
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Hello!

29
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Well, I'm good at seeing things through.

30
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm sure you know a lot of things.

31
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Today, we want people to see things through.

32
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
The first question is...

33
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
This!

34
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The actress who seems to be very good at it.

35
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
You're pretty good at it, aren't you?

36
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
You have a lot of skills, don't you?

37
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
That's what the actress said.

38
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
You're fast, Tenmei.

39
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm interviewing 40 men.

40
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
These are high school students, college students, and salaried men.

41
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Mr. Nagira, what's your answer?

42
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Wait a minute.

43
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
What are you doing in the middle of the show?

44
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
This is Mr. Nagira's answer.

45
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Did something happen?

46
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
It's okay.

47
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
This is...

48
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
It's a simple question, isn't it?

49
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Mr. Nagira, what's your answer?

50
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I don't have a lot of skills.

51
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
You have a lot of skills, don't you?

52
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Tenmei's answer!

53
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I've come to a ridiculous place.

54
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Do you think Mr. Oikubo is good at it?

55
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I'm sure he's good at it.

56
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Actually, I really wanted to do it.

57
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Do you want to do it, too?

58
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I don't have a lot of skills.

59
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Do you have a lot of skills?

60
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I don't have a lot of skills.

61
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I'm...

62
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I'm a leader.

63
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
That's amazing.

64
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I'm a switch-hitter.

65
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Now that we've got the correct answer, let's go to the VTR.

66
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Let's go!

67
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Natsuki Okamoto.

68
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Kanako Higuchi.

69
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Rumiko Koyanagi.

70
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Yuko Asano.

71
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Rumiko Koyanagi.

72
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Shion Iwashita.

73
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Shima Iwashita.

74
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Yoko Minamino.

75
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Rumiko Koyanagi.

76
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Taya Sugimoto.

77
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Minako Tanaka.

78
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Keiko Saito.

79
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Shima Iwashita.

80
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Taya Sugimoto.

81
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Natsuki Okamoto.

82
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Rumiko Koyanagi.

83
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Yukio Toake.

84
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Rumiko Koyanagi.

85
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Rumiko Koyanagi.

86
00:03:36,000 --> 00:04:00,000
The leader of the

87
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:28,000
VTR.

88
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Komotaro Zamurai?

89
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
What do you mean by Komotaro Zamurai?

90
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I don't think Komotaro Zamurai is the VTR.

91
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I know that!

92
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Here, read it.

93
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
A moment of blankness.

94
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
What?

95
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I shouldn't have said that.

96
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Does it look like that?

97
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
That's what I read.

98
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
There's no way it's that strong.

99
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Masamune-kun!

100
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Masayuki.

101
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Masara-ken!

102
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I see.

103
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Isn't that person in the back?

104
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
What could it be?

105
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I think it's getting a little dark.

106
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Let's just say it's the VTR.

107
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Here we go!

108
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Matcha?

109
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Matcha.

110
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Tamori?

111
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Ryu Oshiba-san.

112
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Ryu Oshiba?

113
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Toshi-chan.

114
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Hana-chan.

115
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Matcha.

116
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Hama-chan.

117
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Motofu Yuki?

118
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Tamori-san.

119
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Ryu Oshiba?

120
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Ryu Oshiba.

121
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Tamori-san.

122
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Tamori-san.

123
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Ah, it's Tamori-san.

124
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
The VTR winner is Tamori-san!

125
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Everyone, out!

126
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Tamori-san is in first place.

127
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Everyone feels that way because he's in the show.

128
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
That's why he's in third place.

129
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Masamune-kun is in third place.

130
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Why is that?

131
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Why is that?

132
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Kato Chia-san.

133
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Toshi-chan.

134
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I don't think he's in third place.

135
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
That's why he's in third place.

136
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
He's been in third place for a long time.

137
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
He has a long history.

138
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
That's why he's in third place.

139
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Let's go.

140
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
The last question!

141
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
The last question is this!

142
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
A celebrity who looks like he's pooping!

143
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
You poop a lot when you poop!

144
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
What do you think?

145
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Please write it down!

146
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
What kind of sound does the world make?

147
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Mine is correct.

148
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Let's hear it!

149
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
What kind of sound does the world make?

150
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I know what it is!

151
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
A female actress, Mori Mitsuko-san,

152
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
doesn't look like she's pooping.

153
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
It's because she's been in the show for a long time.

154
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Tenmei-san.

155
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
It's common sense.

156
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Morio-san.

157
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
He looks like he's going to poop a lot.

158
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I can tell.

159
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Masamune-kun.

160
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Wink?

161
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Which one is it?

162
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Which one of them looks like he's going to poop a lot?

163
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Machiro-san, stop putting them together.

164
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
The answer is this!

165
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Nagira Kenichi.

166
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Niko Takeshi.

167
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Wada Akiko-san.

168
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Hamano-san.

169
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Nishikawa Norio.

170
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Hama-chan.

171
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Danpu Matsumoto.

172
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Akiko.

173
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Tamori.

174
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Matcha.

175
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Danpu Matsumoto-san.

176
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Tsurutaro.

177
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Takada Junji.

178
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Nishikawa Norio.

179
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Matcha.

180
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Nishikawa Norio.

181
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Matsumoto-san.

182
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Nishikawa Norio.

183
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Unexpectedly, it's Matcha.

184
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Hamada-san.

185
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
It's Matcha.

186
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
He's going to poop a lot!

187
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
It's Matsumoto-san!

188
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
By the way, first place is Matsumoto-kun,

189
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
second place is Nishikawa Norio-san.

190
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
And fifth place is...

191
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Tokoro-san, Nagira-san, me,

192
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
and Mori Kumiko-san.

193
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Mori Kumiko-san.

194
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Mori Kumiko-san.

195
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Mori Kumiko-san.

196
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
No way!

197
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
And Yoshida-san is on the left and I'm on the right.

198
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Today, I'm talking to the two boys from Kumigaki.

199
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
It's me!

200
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
When is this broadcast?

201
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
It's on the 30th.

202
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Ah!

203
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
So, the 24-hour television is over.

204
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
You know,

205
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
the 24-hour television,

206
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
the voice of love saves the earth.

207
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
If the 24-hour television is over,

208
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
then later...

209
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
You can't say that in the town.

210
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I was going to say it normally.

211
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I was surprised because you said it in such a place.

212
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
This is after it's over.

213
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
What?

214
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
So, after the 24-hour television is over,

215
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
the voice of love saves the earth.

216
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Yes, that's right.

217
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
It's amazing.

218
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
What?

219
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
It's amazing.

220
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
You said it as you planned.

221
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
My eyes are open.

222
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Why?

223
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Are you crying?

224
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I don't understand.

225
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I don't understand.

226
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I'm crying.

227
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
You said it before that.

228
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Why are you crying now?

229
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
But I want to do it a week ago.

230
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I'm already crying.

231
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Liar!

232
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I don't want to cry.

233
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I don't want to cry.

234
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I don't understand.

235
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I don't understand.

236
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
You know,

237
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
especially you,

238
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
you always look like

239
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
you are in a bad mood.

240
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
But you, Hamada,

241
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
you cry easily.

242
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
You cry easily.

243
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
You are a fool.

244
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
You too.

245
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
He is a fool.

246
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Wait a minute.

247
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
He is a fool when he talks.

248
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
It's a title.

249
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
He is a fool.

250
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
It's a title.

251
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
It's a big story.

252
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
It's a big story.

253
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
When we had a concert,

254
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
when we had a concert for the first time,

255
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
we just sang a song.

256
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
That's all.

257
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
It wasn't a disbanding concert.

258
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
It was just a normal concert.

259
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Let me tell you.

260
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
When the ending song was over,

261
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
you cried like this.

262
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
No, no, no.

263
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
That was

264
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
when I saw you

265
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
when I was about to sing the last song.

266
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,000
You were like this.

267
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
When I saw your face,

268
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I was like this.

269
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
You were crying like this.

270
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
You were crying like this.

271
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
You.

272
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
You have to say it properly.

273
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
When I cried,

274
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I was like this.

275
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
You were like this.

276
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
You were crying like this.

277
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
But when you cried,

278
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
and I cried,

279
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
for a while,

280
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I felt like I was relieved.

281
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
This guy.

282
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
When this guy came,

283
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
he was crying like this.

284
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
When I said,

285
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
thank you for your hard work,

286
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:26,000
he was pooping right away.

287
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
At that time,

288
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I wondered what a disbanding concert was like.

289
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I thought so.

290
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I admit that.

291
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
But I don't know if you're going to destroy it in 24 hours.

292
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Like the old Triathlon.

293
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
We're the only ones laughing.

294
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
We did a program with Shinsuke, right?

295
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
We did.

296
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
There's a triathlon, right?

297
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
There's a triathlon in Miyakojima.

298
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
There was.

299
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
From our program,

300
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
one of our young members

301
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,000
recruited a middle-aged man with a car.

302
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
That's the guy who appeared in Triathlon.

303
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
The two guys in the car

304
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
trained for a long time.

305
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
The training was broadcast for half an hour.

306
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
The training scene was broadcast,

307
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
and it was followed by the documentary.

308
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
That's right.

309
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Right?

310
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
It's the same as Mr. Ike.

311
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Mr. Ike.

312
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Mr. Ike said,

313
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
do your best.

314
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Mr. Ike swam all the time.

315
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Swam and switched to a bicycle.

316
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
This time it's a marathon.

317
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Full marathon.

318
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
32.195 km.

319
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
We swam all the time.

320
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
And Mr. Ike...

321
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
What?

322
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
He came in.

323
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
To the last goal.

324
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
It was the finale of half an hour.

325
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I'm sorry.

326
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
If it had been a few hours later,

327
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
it would have been out.

328
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
That's right.

329
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
And Mr. Ike.

330
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Mr. Ike.

331
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Mr. Ike came.

332
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Mr. Ike came running from the other side.

333
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
This is the goal.

334
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
It's taping.

335
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
If you cut the tape,

336
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
it's already a goal.

337
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
There are a lot of other people crying.

338
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Mr. Ike.

339
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Everyone is cheering.

340
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Hamada is also together.

341
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Mr. Ike, this way, this way.

342
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Mr. Ike, do your best.

343
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I cut the tape on my back.

344
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:18,000
What did you do for half an hour?

345
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Then I went back to the hotel and pooped.

346
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I'm scared.

347
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
But maybe 24 hours.

348
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
What about that?

349
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
If everyone takes it to me.

350
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
What?

351
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I'll get it too.

352
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Well, that's okay.

353
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I wonder if I'll get it.

354
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I don't have a fax machine.

355
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I've had it before.

356
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I took a phone call.

357
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Agnes was talking on the phone.

358
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Agnes, where are you?

359
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I've been in Japan for more than 20 years.

360
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I'm still in Katakuta.

361
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Agnes is a cowardly name.

362
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Why?

363
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I want to call her out, but I can't.

364
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Agnes.

365
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I think it's a little cowardly.

366
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
What did you say?

367
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Do we have a place to receive it?

368
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I think so.

369
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I'm waiting at Bodokan.

370
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
That's right.

371
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I'm waiting at Bodokan.

372
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I shake hands with her.

373
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Thank you.

374
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I'll be honest with you.

375
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
There are a lot of handshakes.

376
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I'll be honest with you.

377
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
It's creepy.

378
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
That's right.

379
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I don't want to hold her hand.

380
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
It's scary.

381
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
She's sticky.

382
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
We're the only ones who wear gloves.

383
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
People who wear gloves will know.

384
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
It's creepy.

385
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,000
People who wear gloves will know.

386
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
It's creepy.

387
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
That's why I have gloves.

388
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:03,000
People who wear gloves will know.

389
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
This is the end of the sleeves.

390
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
People who wear gloves will know.

391
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
It looks like a long sleeve.

392
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
At least I have a dress.

393
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Why?

394
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Why do you have to change your clothes according to your gloves?

395
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I'm going to drink a little wine.

396
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I'm wearing a dress.

397
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I'm wearing a T-shirt with a size of 74.

398
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
It's strange to wear gloves like this.

399
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I'm wearing a T-shirt with a size of 74.

400
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:35,000
It's strange to wear gloves like this.

401
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,000
If we have a show like this, I want to make it.

402
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I've been thinking about that.

403
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
There is a program that only people who have seen the show can understand.

404
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
After all, I don't think it's good to joke around like that,

405
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,000
in the midst of a charity program like this.

406
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
You said something like,

407
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I can't work 24 hours a day,

408
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
so I can't do it.

409
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I don't feel like that on a charity program like this.

410
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
You're really going to kill me, aren't you?

411
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Even if you kill me, even if you kill me,

412
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I won't do it.

413
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Because on a charity program like this,

414
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
you're going to kill me, aren't you?

415
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
You're wrong.

416
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
The manager above me came to me first.

417
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
He said,

418
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I can't do this much.

419
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
How old are you?

420
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
How old are you?

421
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
How old are you?

422
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Oh, I see.

423
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
But I'm not that old.

424
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Really?

425
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
But this time, I'm going to do it properly.

426
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
That's right.

427
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:48,000
In the middle of this, I'm going to eat gum and become Kase Taishu.

428
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I'm a little upset about that commercial.

429
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
No, no.

430
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
If you think about it, you're already back.

431
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I'm already back.

432
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
That's right.

433
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
That's right.

434
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
That's not me.

435
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
When I was back,

436
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
When I was back,

437
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I didn't think about anything.

438
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I was doing what I was told to do.

439
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I saw the airing.

440
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
What?

441
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Do you know when I'm back?

442
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I'm desperate to eat more.

443
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
That's a good idea.

444
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
It's really a martial art.

445
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
It's really a martial art.

446
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
That's...

447
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
That's really rude.

448
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
That's not a little...

449
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
It's a little bad, isn't it?

450
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
It's a little bad, isn't it?

451
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Well, that's...

452
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I want to become Kase Taishu.

453
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,000
If I can, I want to see it for about a day.

454
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Really?

455
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Yes.

456
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
If you become Kase Taishu,

457
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
You often say you're a man, don't you?

458
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
They do whatever they want.

459
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Is that true?

460
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
If you go with that kind of look,

461
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I think it's going to be like that.

462
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
First of all, there's a breakaway.

463
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Isn't it refreshing?

464
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Your face is...

465
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Isn't it fresh?

466
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Breakaway?

467
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
After all, it's a breakaway.

468
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Why is it like this?

469
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:10,000
It must have stopped at this point.

470
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
It's a terrible story.

471
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
It's a terrible story.

472
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
After all, we don't know.

473
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
180?

474
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
There's about 180.

475
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
There's more.

476
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
But it's just a story here.

477
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
It's not just a story here.

478
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
It's a serious story.

479
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
A man who is over 180.

480
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Something's wrong.

481
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I'm sorry.

482
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Really.

483
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
That's how you say it.

484
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
If you think hard about something,

485
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
It won't grow that much.

486
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
If you think normally, you don't think about anything.

487
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
That's a beautiful thing.

488
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
The light is back.

489
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I have a question for you.

490
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,000
When you're breathing, sometimes from your nose.

491
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
What the hell is this?

492
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
That's true.

493
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
That's true.

494
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Normally.

495
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
There are times when I'm breathing normally.

496
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
And then I think I'm breathing right now.

497
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
There are times when I'm breathing.

498
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I've done it many times.

499
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Thank you.

500
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I wonder why.

501
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
This is probably...

502
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
When you add it to a million power.

503
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Who?

504
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Who?

505
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
You.

506
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Why didn't you add it to a million power?

507
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
For what?

508
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
When the energy.

509
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
When it reaches a million power.

510
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Who are you?

511
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Energy is a million power.

512
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,000
What do you mean?

513
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
My arms are moving.

514
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
I can't move here.

515
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I'll ask you.

516
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
When it reaches a million power.

517
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I'm a normal human being.

518
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
You're normal human beings, too.

519
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
When the energy reaches a million power.

520
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
When it reaches a million power.

521
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
There's a signal.

522
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
A signal?

523
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:08,000
You're charging now.

524
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I haven't been charged for a long time.

525
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
That's because you've been working too hard.

526
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I haven't received any signal recently.

527
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
That's because you're taking out the energy.

528
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Sometimes.

529
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
That's right.

530
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Because I'm taking out the energy.

531
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
That's right.

532
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
I see.

533
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
It's the same as a electrical device.

534
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,000
When you charge it, the red light turns green in a few hours.

535
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
It's the same as that green light.

536
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
It's a warning.

537
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
You're telling me that my arms are a million power.

538
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
You're telling me that my arms are a million power.

539
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
It's full right now.

540
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
But when I'm tired from the cold.

541
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I sometimes say,

542
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
I sometimes say,

543
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Sometimes.

544
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
It's not like you're making the same sound.

545
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
That's energy.

546
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
That's energy.

547
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I've been charged.

548
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Listen to what happened in Osaka a little while ago.

549
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,000
When I took a taxi in Osaka, they gave me tissue paper.

550
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
I thought Osaka was a terrible city.

551
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
And the next day, I took a different taxi.

552
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
And then they gave me ume jintan.

553
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Why do they give you so many things in Osaka taxi?

554
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
That's right.

555
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
That's right.

556
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
What about Osaka?

557
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Osaka taxi service.

558
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
The driver's attitude is the same.

559
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
The service is alive.

560
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
The service is amazing.

561
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
It's alive.

562
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:36,000
As you can see, they gave me tissue paper, ume jintan, green jintan.

563
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
That's right.

564
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
And...

565
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
And...

566
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
But they gave me a lot of things.

567
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
That area is really alive.

568
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Tokyo is tough.

569
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
But who said that?

570
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Takahashi-san or someone else said that.

571
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
That's right.

572
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:56,000
In the past, the service was a problem.

573
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
In the middle of the night,

574
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,000
I felt really sick.

575
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I couldn't breathe.

576
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
I was so sick that I thought I was going to die.

577
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:11,000
And it was too much to call an ambulance.

578
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
It was embarrassing to call an ambulance in the middle of the night.

579
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
So I called a taxi.

580
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
I got in the taxi.

581
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
I was so sick that I thought I was going to die.

582
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
At that time, the taxi driver said,

583
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Takahashi-san, please.
