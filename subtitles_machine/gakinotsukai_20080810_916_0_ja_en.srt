1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Next time, at the Gaki no Tsukai Ara!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Even if you sleep or wake up, it's Gaino-uchi Gainin Ibiki Announcement!

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The winner is...

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
It's Kowa!

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Yes!

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
It's Kowa!

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Yes!

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Shut up!

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Shut up!

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I can't do this anymore!

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
This is terrible!

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
The 5 people who are at the peak of the Ibuki Gainin world.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Will there be any other Ibuki Gainin that will follow him?

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:57,000
In this program, we will be asking for more Ibuki Gainin, and will be doing a survey of 300 Gainin.

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Then, 14 new voice actors appeared.

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
What kind of voice acting are they going to do?

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
They took a month to film their performance.

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
The tape they recorded was recorded in 500 copies.

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm not going to do voice acting.

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Then, 6 voice actors were selected and sent to the studio.

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
What kind of sound will they make?

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
It's amazing, isn't it?

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
For the first time, they appear in the movie.

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
But they are sleeping.

25
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Let's go.

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Let's see! The first entertainer is this person!

27
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
The entertainer with a good chance.

28
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
The entertainer who pulls the blood of the Eastern Japan.

29
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Why do you have a nan?

30
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I'm a little relieved.

31
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,000
You're not Indian, but it doesn't matter at all.

32
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
But Indians don't have anything to worry about.

33
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Sorry, this is the limit.

34
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
What kind of sound does the castle make?

35
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
He immediately visits Chance's house.

36
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Don't say Chance.

37
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Ah, good morning.

38
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Good morning.

39
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Chance-kun.

40
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I don't know if I can make a sound or not.

41
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Good morning.

42
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Good night.

43
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
After a day as usual, Chance goes to sleep.

44
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
There's no such thing?

45
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
There's no such thing?

46
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Oh, really?

47
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
At least get a towel.

48
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I think a bath towel is fine.

49
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I think it's easier to sleep on the bedside table.

50
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I think it's slanted.

51
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I haven't slept yet.

52
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
It's so bad.

53
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I'm not used to the TV.

54
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
When will the situation change?

55
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
It seems that he can't fall asleep

56
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Excuse me, can you turn off the lights?

57
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
It's too bright

58
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
You can talk

59
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
He listens to the chance and turns off the lights

60
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
It's a chance!

61
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Then, a change appears immediately.

62
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Oh, it's coming!

63
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
This is a good sign.

64
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
This is amazing.

65
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Amazing!

66
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Oh my god!

67
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
What is this?

68
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Who is this?

69
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
It's an old man!

70
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Thank you for the chance!

71
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Don't write it! Don't write it!

72
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Don't write it!

73
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
You wrote a lot!

74
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
You have something at home!

75
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
That's right.

76
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
You have something!

77
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I don't have anything at home.

78
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,000
And the sound of the chance is reaching its peak.

79
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,420
He's heavy today...

80
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:15,620
That was

81
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:32,900
not like a real change.

82
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:31,820
Liamo

83
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:33,820
What?

84
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,820
What is this?

85
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:39,820
Don't go!

86
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:45,820
The sound of the chance is like the animal's whining.

87
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,820
You are really good.

88
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,820
You are amazing, Chance.

89
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,820
The apartment was about to be kicked out.

90
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,820
It was too noisy.

91
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:57,820
The people in this apartment are noisy too.

92
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:59,820
The other ones are noisy too.

93
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:01,820
I was like this when I was in the dormitory.

94
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,820
The female student said,

95
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:05,820
I'm sick of it.

96
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:06,820
I was like this.

97
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:08,820
Can you be quiet for a moment?

98
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:13,820
Including the parents,

99
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:14,820
we had a meeting.

100
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:18,820
The medicine to suppress the stomachache was also taken.

101
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,820
You should have refused.

102
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,820
You were taken?

103
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:25,820
You should have cleaned your nose.

104
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:27,820
I'm sorry.

105
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,820
I'm sorry.

106
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:35,820
The next artist is Takada Corporation's Oya-ki.

107
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:39,820
On stage, he's always in good shape.

108
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:41,820
This man's Ibi-ki.

109
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:43,820
I did it!

110
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:47,820
I did it!

111
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:53,820
I did it!

112
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:55,820
I did it!

113
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:57,820
I did it!

114
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:59,820
It was so big!

115
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:01,820
Takada Corporation

116
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,820
The sound of Oyaki-kun

117
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:05,820
I think we are similar

118
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,820
How was it?

119
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:09,820
Oyaki-kun

120
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:11,820
It's really bad.

121
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:13,820
This is Akane-chan's.

122
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:19,820
This is a key.

123
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:21,820
I didn't do it.

124
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:23,820
It's definitely not.

125
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:29,820
Because he can't sleep, he turns off the lights and shoots.

126
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:33,820
What is that?

127
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,820
The pillow

128
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:50,820
The voice of the father is quiet, but the volume is not so loud

129
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:54,820
But after this, the sound of the father-in-law changed.

130
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:05,820
It hurts!

131
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:06,820
It hurts!

132
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:07,820
It hurts!

133
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:11,820
This breathing is long.

134
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:12,820
It hurts.

135
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:18,820
It's really long.

136
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:20,820
It's going to spit out.

137
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:22,820
It's going to spit out.

138
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:29,820
I almost died.

139
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:38,820
I'm going to have a sore throat.

140
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,820
It's going to spit out.

141
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,820
Are you okay?

142
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:47,820
It's scary.

143
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:48,820
It looks so painful.

144
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:52,820
My stomach is about to explode.

145
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:54,820
I'm dying.

146
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:58,820
It's so painful.

147
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:00,820
I don't want to drink from the side.

148
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:04,820
It's so painful.

149
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:08,820
The dog of the father-in-law is long and painful.

150
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:09,820
I see.

151
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:12,820
The sound is not that loud.

152
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:13,820
It's long.

153
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:14,820
It's long.

154
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,820
That's the most different kind of smell.

155
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:17,820
That's right.

156
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,820
Do you know the difference?

157
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:23,820
I've been in a show before.

158
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,820
As far as I know,

159
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:27,820
I only know that my body stinks.

160
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:29,820
You're the worst.

161
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:34,820
When I have a bad breath, I can't stand the smell.

162
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:38,820
Once, I had a fart in the train on the way.

163
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:39,820
It was too smelly.

164
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:45,820
The smell of the thing you spit out is so strong that I don't know what to call it.

165
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:50,820
Since I'm a woman, I might call it the smell of the back of my ass.

166
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:57,820
But the smell of the back of your ass is because you're a woman.

167
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:59,420
Could it be that Jin?

168
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:01,420
How do you know, Jin!?

169
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:02,720
affiliated with JYP

170
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:03,720
complicated jokes

171
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,120
about Akapin

172
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,320
S character of faucet

173
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,620
acting cool

174
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,520
perch on the hidden под

175
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:10,520
Shaking water

176
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:12,520
Vorac funeral

177
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:16,320
Hey Hibiki-chan

178
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,620
partner

179
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:19,520
Ac endpoint

180
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:24,720
From now, H사가 Danoko will kill you

181
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,720
It's totally different from your image of V.

182
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,720
It's totally different.

183
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,720
The character is still not determined.

184
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,720
It's not determined yet.

185
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,720
It's not determined yet.

186
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,720
What kind of smell is the red pepper?

187
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,720
It's totally different.

188
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,720
Hello.

189
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,720
It's a boy.

190
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,940
game

191
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:06,080
What a good night

192
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:14,920
When think in teary silent dream, artist moves

193
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,960
racist still drawn deep sleep

194
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:24,960
And then...

195
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,960
What's that?

196
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,960
What's that?

197
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,960
What's that?

198
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:44,460
Eh?

199
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:45,960
What is it?

200
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,960
Scary, scary, it's a little scary.

201
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:49,960
What is it?

202
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:52,960
It's scary, scary, it's showing.

203
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:48,800
Ah, it's showing the

204
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:00,960
It's showing it completely.

205
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,960
This is bad.

206
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:07,960
I was saying..

207
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:11,960
I'm gonna complete the task..

208
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,960
etin..

209
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,960
What are you even saying?

210
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,960
What on earth are you talking about?

211
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,960
The end.

212
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,960
The end.

213
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,960
Zoma-hon.

214
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:45,960
The red pepper is a very difficult person to talk to.

215
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,960
I got it.

216
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,960
You said Zoma Hon!

217
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:54,960
You said it clearly!

218
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,960
You said you had a dream of Zoma Hon.

219
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:02,960
I think Zoma Hon is now the second generation of my father-in-law, Takeshi's fan.

220
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:06,960
He is the second generation of my father-in-law.

221
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,960
Oh, I've seen it.

222
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:14,960
In front of the Lord, if you get a good beating and get a little money, you'll be excited.

223
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,960
But in front of us, he sleeps in the back of the studio.

224
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:20,960
He's been so busy, so I think that's why he's sleeping.

225
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,960
What is this?

226
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,960
This is...

227
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:27,960
I usually sell cosmetics.

228
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:28,960
By your part-time job?

229
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:29,960
By my part-time job.

230
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:30,960
In Machimoto Keio.

231
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:31,960
This is a good one.

232
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:32,960
Ah, this is good.

233
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,960
It's a very good one.

234
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,960
Look, look, I'm fixing it.

235
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,960
Stop doing that.

236
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:44,960
The voice actor of Hirae no Hibiki, Hirae Shunsuke

237
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:50,960
The voice actor of Hirae no Hibiki, who can be easily fooled by the voice actor of Hirae no Hibiki

238
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,960
This is my boyfriend

239
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:57,960
This is a hidden camera

240
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,960
I don't know him

241
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,960
You know him well

242
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:05,960
I once had a job at a hotel

243
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:08,960
I happened to be in the same room with him.

244
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,960
I told the manager who changed the room for me,

245
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,960
He said, please stay with me.

246
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,960
At that time, the room was noisy.

247
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:18,960
I thought I should sleep on the bed of the unit bus.

248
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,960
Why do I care so much about my partner?

249
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:26,960
It's strange that the room is the same.

250
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:30,960
You are a little early.

251
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,960
I thought it was over.

252
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:39,960
What kind of smell will Dorian's Hirae draw?

253
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:47,960
I drew a girl's outfit.

254
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:51,960
It's a girl's outfit.

255
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,960
It's a raw look.

256
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,960
I don't want to show my armpit.

257
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,960
What's with those pants?

258
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:02,960
What's with that pattern?

259
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,960
You're a hot punk.

260
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,960
It's the money of a big family.

261
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,960
Here it comes.

262
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:19,460
The

263
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:30,960
This is a super turn.

264
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:33,460
It's amazing.

265
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:41,460
If you continue to shoot, a sign of fatness has appeared on the back.

266
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:42,460
What is that?

267
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:44,460
Does it stop?

268
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:47,460
It doesn't stop.

269
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:48,460
Wow!

270
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:50,460
Eh?

271
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:51,460
I don't breathe that much.

272
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:53,460
It's stopped.

273
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:57,460
Wow!

274
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:59,460
You're really doing it!

275
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:01,460
Eh?

276
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:06,460
Wow!

277
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:08,460
That was close!

278
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:09,460
That was close!

279
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:10,460
About one minute.

280
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:11,460
Welcome back!

281
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:13,460
That was close!

282
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:14,460
That was close!

283
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:19,460
What else is this symptom?

284
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:20,460
What's wrong?

285
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:27,460
Ah, it's a toothache.

286
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:35,460
What's wrong with you?

287
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:37,460
I'm dying!

288
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:43,460
Will the one who is alone be able to breathe without any breathing?

289
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:46,460
In his case, he's double.

290
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:47,460
He's double.

291
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:49,460
He's a little bit of a mess.

292
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:51,460
I don't like that.

293
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:55,460
But if you wake up, you'll have symptoms of pain in your jaw.

294
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:57,460
I wonder how much pain I'll have.

295
00:16:57,460 --> 00:17:02,460
When I think back, I've been taken off my jaw once.

296
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:05,460
When I was in junior high, I used to say it in a big voice, but...

297
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:07,460
I was bullied.

298
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:10,460
I don't say it like this.

299
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:12,460
What are you coming up with?

300
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:15,460
There was a pattern that I didn't say.

301
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:18,460
There was a pattern.

302
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:21,460
Ibiki Gainin, Den Kacchan.

303
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:27,460
With a strong visual, I can see the Ibiki that the Gainin of Iyashikei can't.

304
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:29,460
3, 2, 1, go!

305
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:38,460
It's Dekka-chan!

306
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:40,460
Hello!

307
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,460
Well, Dekka-chan is here.

308
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:45,460
Dekka-chan, you were hospitalized recently.

309
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:47,460
There were a lot of things, right?

310
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:48,460
That's right.

311
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:52,460
Well, I don't have that much money, so I was hospitalized in a 6-person room.

312
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:57,460
The other five were all old men and they all snored.

313
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:59,460
I thought it was really noisy.

314
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:02,460
But somehow I fell asleep and woke up.

315
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:04,460
Then the manager said,

316
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:09,460
Dekka-chan, we're moving to a private room.

317
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:12,460
I was snoring and moved to a private room.

318
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:14,460
I asked why we were moving.

319
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:18,460
The moment I fell asleep, I heard there were five nurse calls.

320
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:20,460
Seriously?

321
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:22,460
It's all good!

322
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:28,460
What kind of sound will Dekka-chan make?

323
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:35,460
It's scary

324
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:38,460
It's Ronan's

325
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:40,460
I don't know.

326
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:42,460
I don't know about the last time I was a loner.

327
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:58,460
The start is slow.

328
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:03,460
It's a bit big.

329
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:08,460
Wow, this is...

330
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:13,460
Hey, don't hold down the nurse's call.

331
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:18,460
Did it stop?

332
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:19,460
What are you doing?

333
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:21,460
It's dirty.

334
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:23,460
What are you doing?

335
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:24,460
It's dirty.

336
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:26,460
What are you doing?

337
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:28,460
Victory?

338
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:38,460
After this, something unexpected happens to Dekika-chan's body.

339
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:47,460
It's over. It's over.

340
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:48,460
Oh no.

341
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:50,460
What happened?

342
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:55,460
I don't know that!

343
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:58,460
I don't know that!

344
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:02,460
Why are you doing that?

345
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:05,460
I think it's already done

346
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:10,460
The pain is gone, and the snorting sound of Zecca-chan is even deeper

347
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:16,460
Wow, it's a monster!

348
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:18,460
Uuuuugh!

349
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:20,460
This is...

350
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:22,460
If you sleep on the side, this is...

351
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:24,460
This is...

352
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:26,460
Uuuuugh!

353
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:28,460
I'll press the button.

354
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:36,460
Is Rekka-chan's voice really that loud?

355
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:44,460
Even if it's the other side of the sound, it can't be helped.

356
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:48,460
No, I can't hear you.

357
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:54,460
Kurowato, the Ibitio has come back.

358
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:59,460
Ibitio's Onigiri has arrived.

359
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:07,460
It hasn't gotten better since then, right?

360
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:08,460
That's right.

361
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:11,460
You said that Matsumoto-san and you went on a trip again.

362
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:21,460
So, Yamazaki-san and Matsumoto-san stayed in the same room, and I stayed in the private room.

363
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:25,460
Was that private room the Deluxe Suite Room?

364
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:27,460
See, it's like this.

365
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:33,460
It's interesting when you talk about it.

366
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:34,460
That's right.

367
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:39,460
His specialty is to talk about what happened.

368
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:41,460
I'm sorry.

369
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:46,460
Please watch the precious sound of the rice ball.

370
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:52,460
It's past 1 o'clock in the evening.

371
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:54,460
The rice ball is sleeping quietly.

372
00:21:55,460 --> 00:22:00,460
Then, in 30 minutes from the end, a change appears.

373
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:01,660
The spray would be released.

374
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:15,200
The wheezing will be fordi of the sound, called the sound

375
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:19,680
of her nodding off.

376
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,680
It's like a ghost.

377
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,680
This is the feeling of being spoiled.

378
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,680
Are you a monster?

379
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,680
Monster, Monster.

380
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:46,680
What is this?

381
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:47,680
I'm sorry.

382
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,680
I'm sorry.

383
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,680
I'm sorry.

384
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,680
want to drop purchase

385
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:17,640
I just wanna see!

386
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,840
It is just basically like a training

387
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:34,840
This VTR is still better.

388
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:37,840
There are more times when it's normal.

389
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,840
Ahhhhhhh!

390
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,840
Really good.

391
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,840
Really good.

392
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,840
Normally.

393
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,840
Ahhhhhhh!

394
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,840
It's a good thing.

395
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:53,840
The final winner is the rice ball.

396
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,840
Go, go!

397
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,840
Ryotome Jamboree, it's good.

398
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:58,840
Everyone come here!

399
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:01,840
The show of using children is currently on air on Japanese TV!

400
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:07,840
We have prepared various ways to make you come, and we are waiting for your visit!

401
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,840
What is this?
