1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
In the first episode of Gaki no Tsukai, we have the manager of Chikizuki, Mr. Dantan, Mr. Isomata.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Mr. Isomata again?

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Yes, that's right.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Mr. Isomata is the star of Gaki no Tsukai.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Despite his wild side, he has a kind heart. What will he show us today?

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Today, we're going to talk about cooking. Usually, when I watch shows like this, I don't feel like they're delicious.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I see.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
That's why the main topic is important.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
This is the most important topic.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
That's right.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
This main topic is, you shouldn't be in a warm living environment.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I see.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
That's what we're going to talk about today.

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I see.

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Let's get started.

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Nice to meet you.

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm wearing makeup today.

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Are you wearing makeup?

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
He's wearing makeup in front of the mirror.

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Why is that?

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm changing my mood.

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
This program is brought to you by the following sponsors.

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
First, we'll challenge the title call.

24
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Do your best.

25
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Let's go.

26
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Ready, action.

27
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Isomata Takumono, Oishinbo Manzai.

28
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Why are you doing that?

29
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
The sauce is in front of me.

30
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
What if I put my hand on it?

31
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
You'll put your hand on it?

32
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Yes.

33
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
You're the assistant director.

34
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Let's do that.

35
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
The cameraman can do it.

36
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
The cameraman can't do it.

37
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
The cameraman can't do it.

38
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I can only hear your voice.

39
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Ready, action.

40
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Isomata Takumono, Oishinbo Manzai.

41
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
It's cold.

42
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
It's cold.

43
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
It's cold.

44
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Okay.

45
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
That was okay.

46
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Okay.

47
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I'll take the cold one.

48
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Isomata, the food is ready.

49
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
It's time to eat.

50
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Where are you looking?

51
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I'm here.

52
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
You bastard.

53
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Let's eat.

54
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Welcome.

55
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I'm the chef, Kumagai.

56
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I'm the manager, Isomata.

57
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Nice to meet you.

58
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Nice to meet you.

59
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Let's eat.

60
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
This is my first time eating this.

61
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:55,000
First of all, he tastes the world's delicacy, truffle.

62
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
This tastes a little hard to describe.

63
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
What?

64
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I've been waiting for this for a long time.

65
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I don't know what to do.

66
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Let's eat.

67
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Next is the escargot croquette.

68
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
How is it?

69
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I've never eaten escargot before.

70
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:47,000
It has potatoes in it, so it tastes like croquette the most.

71
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I made it with the image of croquette.

72
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
It's croquette.

73
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I've never tasted escargot before, so I don't know what it tastes like, but it tastes like it's been erased.

74
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Let's eat.

75
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Let's eat.

76
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
The main dish is red wine.

77
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
This is really delicious.

78
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:33,000
How do you express how delicious it is?

79
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I'll repeat what I said earlier.

80
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,000
It's easy to get familiar with the fact that it doesn't taste like French food.

81
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
It's delicious.

82
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
But this is French food.

83
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
This gourmet program has been completed.

84
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
It's mid-March, and it's getting warmer and warmer.

85
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Good evening, I'm the manager, Isomata.

86
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I was invited to such a spring atmosphere today.

87
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I would like to eat delicious traditional French food like escargot in Yoyogi.

88
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Let's go.

89
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Welcome. I'm the chef, Kumanai.

90
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I'm the manager, Isomata.

91
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Nice to meet you.

92
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Today's entree is called a vegetarian salad.

93
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,000
It's a salad with foie gras, truffles, and duck.

94
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
It's pretty cold.

95
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Is it cold?

96
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Yes.

97
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:11,000
It's a little cold, and it's only warm.

98
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:22,000
It's the first time I've had it, but it's not much different from chicken.

99
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
This is escargot croquette.

100
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Croquette?

101
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Yes.

102
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
The one on the far left is escargot.

103
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
This one?

104
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Yes.

105
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I'll give it to you.

106
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
It doesn't really taste like escargot, does it?

107
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
No, it doesn't.

108
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Today's main dish is red wine with beef with bones and bulgogi.

109
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Where did you learn to be a chef?

110
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I lived in France for a while.

111
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Really?

112
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Yes.

113
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I don't really like or dislike anything, but it doesn't taste good.

114
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I don't really want to eat it again.

115
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Cut!

116
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Eat it!

117
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
That person has finally stood up to Isomato's insolence.

118
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
He moved the stage from French to Chinese cuisine for a location tour.

119
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Yamachan Shuren and Oishinbo Banzai will be on the air in the second half of the program.

120
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Ready, go!

121
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Hello.

122
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Good evening.

123
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
You're a bit late today.

124
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
What's the matter?

125
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Huh?

126
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
What's the matter?

127
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,000
You're a human being, so you must have something to say.

128
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Nothing.

129
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I'm afraid of heights.

130
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Really?

131
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I don't like heights.

132
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I really don't like heights.

133
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
You skydived, didn't you?

134
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
What?

135
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
You skydived, didn't you?

136
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I didn't do it.

137
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I didn't do it.

138
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I can't do it.

139
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I can't do it no matter how many steps I take.

140
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
You skydived.

141
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
That's right.

142
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I was about to fly, but you got caught in the string.

143
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I said, I don't like it anymore.

144
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I saw a gentle side of you.

145
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
What?

146
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Well, well, well.

147
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
But if you go that far, you have to do it.

148
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
You have to do it, too.

149
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
No, I didn't do it.

150
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I don't like things I don't like.

151
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I'm good at things I'm good at.

152
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Someone said that.

153
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Anyway.

154
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I don't like things I don't like.

155
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I'm taking you to a punishment game, so you can't say you don't like it there.

156
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
No, I'll say it.

157
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I don't like it.

158
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
You're dirty.

159
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
That's not good.

160
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
You have to do it.

161
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I don't like that kind of thinking.

162
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
What?

163
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
It's bitter.

164
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I don't like it, but I have to do it.

165
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Where did you come from?

166
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I don't like it, but I have to do it.

167
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I don't like that person, but I have to go out with her.

168
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I can't do that.

169
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
No one said that.

170
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
If you don't like it, you can go out with her.

171
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
That's a strange example.

172
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Kiss me.

173
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
What?

174
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
What is it?

175
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
It's easy to do it.

176
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
That's not it.

177
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
If you do it like this, you can't do it like this.

178
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Where are you looking at?

179
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
If you do it like this, you can't do it like this.

180
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
We all decided that.

181
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
What are you doing?

182
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I'm talking to everyone.

183
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Men are scary.

184
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Why?

185
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Men are scary.

186
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Why?

187
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
When you're with a girl,

188
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I don't know if the girl feels that way,

189
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
but when I'm with her, I look at her.

190
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
That's because you have a good father, right?

191
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I don't know if I have a good father,

192
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
so I look for a man.

193
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
At that time, I have scary eyes.

194
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I know that I'm doing it myself,

195
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
but I don't know at that time.

196
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I don't know if it's true.

197
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
That's too much.

198
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
It's really scary.

199
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I have scary eyes all the time.

200
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I don't think so.

201
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
You're looking at her casually, right?

202
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Yes.

203
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I'm saying,

204
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
It was too late.

205
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I'm looking at her like this.

206
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Long, long.

207
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
My legs and my father.

208
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Long, long.

209
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I'm going to get caught.

210
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I'm going to get caught.

211
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I haven't noticed the woman.

212
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
It's long.

213
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I shouldn't look at her like that.

214
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I'm looking at her like this.

215
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
That's funny.

216
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I don't think there's a woman.

217
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I don't think there's a woman.

218
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I don't think a woman can look at me like that.

219
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
You mean like this?

220
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Yes.

221
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I'm not waiting for that.

222
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
No way.

223
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Men are scary.

224
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
It would be nice if there was a woman.

225
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I'm saying,

226
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
The bell rang.

227
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
That's too much.

228
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
You shouldn't focus on the bell.

229
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
What's this?

230
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
You'll get caught.

231
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
If that's the case, let's look at her.

232
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
As a man, I've never experienced a woman looking at me like that.

233
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I see.

234
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
But what about women?

235
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I don't know.

236
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
But your father will definitely look at you.

237
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I guess.

238
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I don't know how much he's looking at you.

239
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,000
But if you wear a skirt like this and sit down like you're drinking,

240
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
he'll definitely look at you.

241
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
He'll look at me, right?

242
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I don't like the way he looks at you.

243
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Your father will listen to you.

244
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Even when you're talking.

245
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
But he'll obviously look at you.

246
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
He'll be like,

247
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
What are you talking about?

248
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
He'll be like, what are you doing?

249
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
And he'll look at the menu and go like this.

250
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
He'll be focusing on the other side and go like this.

251
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Really.

252
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
That's dirty.

253
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
And then he'll come out like a horn.

254
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
He'll come out like this.

255
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
You're making a bad face.

256
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Men are scary.

257
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
You really have to watch out for women.

258
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I have a question for Matsumoto-san, who's also the leader of the sexy group.

259
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Yes, yes.

260
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Just like a flower has its own flower language,

261
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
sushi also has its own sushi language.

262
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
What kind of language does sushi have?

263
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
That's all there is to it.

264
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I've never heard of sushi language.

265
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
That's why we don't say it.

266
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Do you know what a flower language is?

267
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
There's something like that.

268
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
What about the tulip flower language?

269
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I don't know that.

270
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
What is that?

271
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Why did you come here today?

272
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
You don't even know that.

273
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
If that's the main thing, I'll go look it up myself.

274
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
What did you come here for?

275
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
My...

276
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Language.

277
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Of course there's a language.

278
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
What month were you born?

279
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
May.

280
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
May, right?

281
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
That means...

282
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Shrimp, right?

283
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
That's just one of your favorite dishes.

284
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
No, no. I was born sushi.

285
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I'm tuna sushi.

286
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Huh?

287
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I was born sushi.

288
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I was born sushi.

289
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I was born sushi.

290
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I'm shrimp.

291
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
You should at least know that.

292
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
My sushi was shrimp.

293
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
It was shrimp.

294
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Wait, wait. You were born in September, right?

295
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
September.

296
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
What sushi were you born in?

297
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Oh, Maki.

298
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Maki.

299
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Maki?

300
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Maki.

301
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Maki sushi?

302
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Maki sushi.

303
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
That's not very good.

304
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Well, that's not a problem.

305
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I taught you the main thing.

306
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
What is it?

307
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I don't understand.

308
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I told you to teach me the sushi language.

309
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
You want to hear that?

310
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Oh, really?

311
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Yes.

312
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
That's fine.

313
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
So I'm shrimp, right?

314
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Yes, yes, yes.

315
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
You should at least know the sushi language of shrimp.

316
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I'm Maki.

317
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I know.

318
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
So first, teach me the sushi language of shrimp.

319
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Oh, that's fine.

320
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Yes.

321
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
So tell me why you're panting.

322
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
If you're panting here, I wouldn't be able to tell you.

323
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Yes.

324
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Are you sure?

325
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Yes, I am.

326
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
So hurry up and tell me.

327
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
That's right.

328
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
You were born in May.

329
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
That's why I'm telling you.

330
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Do you know that?

331
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I know.

332
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
You were born in May.

333
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Yes.

334
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Oh, okay.

335
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
So hurry up.

336
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Why?

337
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
What do you mean hurry up?

338
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
What should I do?

339
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
What should I do?

340
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
You should have come.

341
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I went, so what?

342
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
You were born in May, right?

343
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Yes.

344
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Hurry up.

345
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Okay, okay.

346
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Thank you.

347
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
What are you eating?

348
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
What are you eating?

349
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
It's a fu.

350
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Hey.

351
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
What?

352
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Tell me the sushi language of shrimp.

353
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Okay, I'll tell you.

354
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:09,000
You should have woken up in the morning.

355
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I woke up.

356
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I woke up, so I'm here.

357
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
What are you doing?

358
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
What?

359
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
What are you doing?

360
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
You should have woken up in the morning.

361
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
What about the roll?

362
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
What are you talking about?

363
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I have my own sushi language.

364
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
So tell me that.

365
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
You were born in September.

366
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I want to know.

367
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
You were born in September.

368
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
What about the roll?

369
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
You guys are out of rolls.

370
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I am shrimp.

371
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I should have woken up in the morning.

372
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
You...

373
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
You should have woken up, Matsuo.

374
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
You should have woken up, Matsuo.

375
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
You should have woken up, Matsuo.

376
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
The sushi language of roll.

377
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
You were born in September?

378
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Are you talking about that?

379
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Can you tell September is the previous and the second period?

380
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
It's my turn.

381
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I was born in September.

382
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
So I'm the previous period.

383
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
It's okay.

384
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
The previous period is okay.

385
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Who taught you that?

386
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
The fat one, right?

387
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
It's divided into the fat roll and the thin roll

388
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
The previous one was the fat roll

389
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Then the fat one

390
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
The fat one, right?

391
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Kawajan is...

392
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
What is this?

393
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
What is Kawajan?

394
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
What is Kawajan?

395
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I want you to remember my words

396
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
That's why you should say it

397
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I'm so angry

398
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
You're angry?

399
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
If you say that, you'll have to say it from January to December

400
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
It's fine

401
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Right?

402
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Is there anyone from January?

403
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Yes

404
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
This is a rose

405
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
What?

406
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
A rose sushi?

407
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
The current one is a rose sushi

408
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
It's not a big deal

409
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Yes, a rose sushi

410
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
A sushi word

411
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
It's fine if you gather

412
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
What is this?

413
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
It's like you're throwing it away

414
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
At this pace

415
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
You can't even make fun of 12 of them

416
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
It's obvious that you won't do it

417
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Aoka, this is the end

418
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Do you know anyone from January?

419
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
A rose sushi

420
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
This guy is annoying

421
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
It's fine if you gather

422
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Anyone from February?

423
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
There are already a few

424
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
What about February?

425
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Kanpyo

426
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Kanpyo maki

427
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
It's Kanpyo maki

428
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
It's Kanpyo maki, so please remember it

429
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
What about the sushi word?

430
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
It's fine if you don't have it

431
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
What are you talking about?

432
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
That's how you feel about Kanpyo maki

433
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Right?

434
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:21,000
It's fine if you don't have it

435
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
There are 10 more

436
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
That's how it is

437
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
What do you mean by that?

438
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
There are many things

439
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Is there anyone you want to ask?

440
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
What month?

441
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
December

442
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
It's the end of the year

443
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
It's the end of the year

444
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
What about the sushi word?

445
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
What about December?

446
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
I was surprised

447
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I thought it was fine

448
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
I see

449
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
It's the end of the year

450
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
It's a joke

451
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
It's gone

452
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
It's gone

453
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
It's gone since January

454
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I see

455
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
It's gone since December

456
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I thought it was too much

457
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
It's the end of the year

458
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
It's the end of the year

459
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
It's fine if you don't have it

460
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
It's fine if you don't have it

461
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
It's fine if you don't have it

462
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
It's fine if you don't have it

463
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
This is a question for Dandy Matsumoto

464
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Thank you

465
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
If you do this, it's the end

466
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Please tell us the 6 things your dad does

467
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
There are many

468
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Really?

469
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
It won't work

470
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
I don't think so

471
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
It's the best 6

472
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
I see

473
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
What's the 6th?

474
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
The 6th is

475
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Writing your name on your underwear

476
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
That's not your dad's fault

477
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
It's your mom's fault

478
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
You write your dad

479
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
It's the end of the year

480
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
It's your mom's fault

481
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Then it's the 7th

482
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
What?

483
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Then it's the 7th

484
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Then it's the 6th

485
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
What?

486
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
The 6th

487
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
What do you think it is?

488
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
There are thousands of them

489
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
What do you think your dad is?

490
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
My dad...

491
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
When he wears socks, he does this

492
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
He does this

493
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
That's stupid

494
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
It's stupid, but tell us the order

495
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
It has nothing to do with my dad

496
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
I see

497
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
What is it?

498
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
What is it?

499
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Tell us the top

500
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
The top?

501
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
The top is

502
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
When he gets angry

503
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Hey!

504
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
That's stupid

505
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
This is pretty bad

506
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
When he gets angry

507
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
That kind of dad

508
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
What's the 5th?

509
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
The 5th is

510
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
The 5th is

511
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
The 5th is

512
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
When he gets angry

513
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
It's not that different from before

514
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
It's all about movement

515
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
What's the 3rd?

516
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
The 4th

517
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
When he hits

518
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
How do you make this funny?

519
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
I don't know

520
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Stop it!

521
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Yamasaki Hosei's Oishinbo

522
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Oishinbo Banzai!

523
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
The last dish

524
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
It's Beijing Koya

525
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Beijing Koya

526
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
It's called Beijing Duck

527
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Beijing Duck?

528
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
It's black

529
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
It's because of the rain

530
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
The rain?

531
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
When?

532
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
When?

533
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Beijing Duck

534
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
It's a luxurious dish

535
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
It's a luxurious dish

536
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
It's a luxurious dish

537
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
It's a luxurious dish

538
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Beijing Duck

539
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Beijing Duck

540
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Now

541
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
I'd like you to eat the Beijing Duck

542
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
It's for you

543
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
I'll give you an example

544
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Sometimes

545
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
When you're drunk

546
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
You walk home on the train

547
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
When you're not on the train

548
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
At that time

549
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
You remember

550
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:37,000
I don't know what to say
