1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,720
die

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:05,720
them

3
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,280
ah

4
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:31,280
In Okinawa, let's buy a lot of Chikitsuki at Gaki no Tsukai in the second time!

5
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,280
You got 10,000 yen just now, right?

6
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,280
Yes, yes, yes.

7
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:40,280
With this 10,000 yen, you can get 10kg.

8
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:41,280
Oh, I see.

9
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,280
You can buy it later and put it on the weight.

10
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,280
Well, compared to Tokyo, Fukuoka is cheaper, isn't it?

11
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,280
Well, yes.

12
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,280
You may be able to shop more than before.

13
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,280
Yes, yes.

14
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:49,280
Where are you going?

15
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,280
Well, there is only this shopping street.

16
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:55,280
So I'm not going to the other side.

17
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,280
I'm going in the same way.

18
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,280
What?

19
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:00,280
Because there is only this shopping street.

20
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,280
No, there is only this shopping street.

21
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,280
You don't do anything here.

22
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,280
20,000 yen.

23
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,280
It's amazing. Listen to it.

24
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:25,280
It doesn't matter what it is.

25
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,280
I'll play it, so you dance.

26
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,280
Hey, dance.

27
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,280
What am I doing?

28
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:42,280
This is it.

29
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,280
This is it.

30
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,280
This is it.

31
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,280
Wow.

32
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,280
This is the dance.

33
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,280
This is bad.

34
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,280
No, no, no.

35
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,280
Do you take this?

36
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,280
Yes.

37
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,280
This is bad.

38
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,280
I don't know if I'll get caught.

39
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,280
Look.

40
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,280
This is bad.

41
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:18,280
This is bad.

42
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,280
Mom, wrap it with this.

43
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,280
What?

44
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,280
Wrap it with this lid.

45
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,280
If I do this, it will collapse.

46
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,280
It's okay.

47
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,280
It may collapse.

48
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:47,280
It's heavy.

49
00:02:47,280 --> 00:03:08,280
It's heavy.

50
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,280
Grandma, come on.

51
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:15,280
It seems to be Okinawa.

52
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,280
It seems to be Okinawa.

53
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:26,280
If I give it to all the staff, it may weigh about 5kg.

54
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,280
Well, then.

55
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,280
Yes.

56
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,280
What each of you bought is 10kg?

57
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,280
I think so.

58
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,280
Let's find out.

59
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,280
Yes.

60
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,280
This, this.

61
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,280
Ah.

62
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,280
Try it out there.

63
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,280
Ah.

64
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,280
Ah.

65
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,280
Well, then.

66
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,280
Try it out there.

67
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,280
Crab.

68
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,280
This is a bite of black sugar.

69
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,280
It's funny.

70
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:05,280
This was laughed at by the staff and Haraka.

71
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,280
This is a joke.

72
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,280
It's funny.

73
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,280
How many did you buy?

74
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,280
This is one.

75
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,280
This is a joke.

76
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,280
That's good.

77
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,280
That's good.

78
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,280
This is.

79
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,280
What is this?

80
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,280
What is this?

81
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,280
A pig's face.

82
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,280
Do this.

83
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,280
Do this in front of your face.

84
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,280
I don't like it.

85
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,280
I hate it.

86
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,280
What?

87
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,280
Stop it, you idiot.

88
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,280
Don't call me brother.

89
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,280
Wow, it's good.

90
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,280
I was told that you were good at it, so I bought it.

91
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,280
You are the last.

92
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,280
What?

93
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,280
The last?

94
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,280
Do you want to drink this with everyone?

95
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,280
What is that?

96
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,280
Then you should measure it.

97
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,280
It's not a big deal.

98
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,280
3.5 kg.

99
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,280
No way.

100
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,280
It's 4 kg.

101
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,280
It's not.

102
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,280
3.5 kg.

103
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,280
8 kg.

104
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,280
8 kg.

105
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,280
It's good.

106
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,280
You idiot.

107
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,280
It's increasing.

108
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,280
It's increasing.

109
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,280
What kind of calculation is that?

110
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,280
What?

111
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,280
At this point, it's 7.5 kg.

112
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,280
If you add 3 kg, how much will it be?

113
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,280
I didn't say that anyone could add 3 kg.

114
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,280
Really?

115
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,280
I don't know.

116
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,280
I don't know if it's used in Okinawa.

117
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,280
I don't know if it's used in Osaka.

118
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,280
Then add all the juice.

119
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,280
It's just right to add all the juice.

120
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,280
Add it here.

121
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,280
Wait a minute.

122
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,280
Do you hate me?

123
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,280
Put it here.

124
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,280
What are you going to do?

125
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,280
Put it in here.

126
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,280
Where are you going?

127
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,280
Hey.

128
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,280
Hey.

129
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,280
I give up the game.

130
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:39,280
This is my victory.

131
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,280
You're annoying.

132
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,280
You're annoying.

133
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,280
You're annoying.

134
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,280
You killed me.

135
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,280
You're annoying.

136
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:52,280
You're annoying.

137
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,280
I just turned on the lights in the back.

138
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,280
What kind of idea is that?

139
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,280
I was really worried.

140
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,280
Everyone was coming.

141
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,280
What if there was no reaction?

142
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,280
I was wondering if there would be a reaction.

143
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,280
Everyone was talking like a fool.

144
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,280
Well.

145
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:13,280
I'm the one who came.

146
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,280
I'm the one who came.

147
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,280
We've been to Okinawa a lot.

148
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,280
That's right.

149
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,280
We've been to Okinawa a lot.

150
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,280
This is the fourth or fifth time.

151
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,280
When I first came, I was deceived by Okinawa.

152
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,280
Why?

153
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,280
I went there first.

154
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,280
I went to Haimurubu Island.

155
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,280
I went to Akko.

156
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:39,280
When I first went to Akko, I had to buy souvenirs.

157
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,280
I didn't know what to buy.

158
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,280
I asked the local people.

159
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,280
Are you local?

160
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,280
I asked the local people.

161
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:53,280
After all, when I came to Okinawa, this was the only thing I had.

162
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,280
You were introduced to me.

163
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,280
I was introduced to you.

164
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,280
I thought about it.

165
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,280
What is it?

166
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,280
When I went back to Japan.

167
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,280
You're not good.

168
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,280
You're not good.

169
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:08,280
You're angry.

170
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:11,280
When I went back to Osaka.

171
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,280
I gave it to him.

172
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,280
He didn't like it.

173
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,280
The local people said,

174
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,280
This is amazing.

175
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,280
He said, This is delicious.

176
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,280
Did you eat it?

177
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,280
That's right.

178
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,280
What did you give him?

179
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,280
Chinsuko.

180
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,280
That's not good.

181
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,280
Do you like it?

182
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,280
That's not good.

183
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,280
That's not good.

184
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,280
Is that true?

185
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,280
I gave him that.

186
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,280
That's right.

187
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,280
Orion beer is delicious.

188
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,280
Beer is delicious.

189
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,280
Beer is really delicious.

190
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,280
I went to Okuma.

191
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,280
That's right.

192
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,280
I was only two people.

193
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,280
That's right.

194
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,280
The manager didn't use anything.

195
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,280
That's right.

196
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:59,280
We were left alone.

197
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,280
That's right.

198
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,280
It was hard.

199
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,280
That's right.

200
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:08,280
At that time, we became a couple.

201
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,280
What are you talking about?

202
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:17,280
When he got married, I was frustrated.

203
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:22,280
You were sleeping at that time.

204
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,280
What are you talking about?

205
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,280
That's right.

206
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,280
What about Okinawa?

207
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,280
We live in Okinawa.

208
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:33,280
What do you think about being invited to Tokyo or Osaka?

209
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,280
What do you think?

210
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,280
I don't like it.

211
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,280
I don't like it.

212
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,280
But I understand.

213
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:44,280
Have you ever been to Osaka or Tokyo?

214
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,280
That's right.

215
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,280
What do you think?

216
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:49,280
Have you ever been to Osaka?

217
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,280
I have been to Osaka.

218
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,280
What do you think of Osaka?

219
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,280
What do you think of the city of Osaka?

220
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:58,280
What do you think of the city of Osaka?

221
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,280
It doesn't change much.

222
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,280
Don't lie to me.

223
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:07,280
Osaka is famous for Dengana and Mangana.

224
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,280
That's right.

225
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:11,280
When I was walking on the street, it was Dengana and Mangana.

226
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,280
What is Dengana?

227
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,280
What is Mangana?

228
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:18,280
I have been walking on Kokusai Street.

229
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:25,280
This street is called Chochune.

230
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:31,280
That's the word only Mr. Gushiken uses.

231
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,280
Is that so?

232
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,280
Everyone says that.

233
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:38,280
Chochune! Chochune!

234
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,280
That's strange.

235
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:43,280
I have to go to the hotel.

236
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:46,280
I don't know which way to take a taxi.

237
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:49,280
I asked the staff at the hotel where I should go.

238
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,280
He said Chochune.

239
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,280
That's true.

240
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,280
Don't lie to me.

241
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,280
That's true.

242
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,280
He said Chochune.

243
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,280
I said it.

244
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:01,280
He said Chochune.

245
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,280
Please teach me how to say it.

246
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:05,280
I don't understand.

247
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,280
What?

248
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:13,280
Is this your program?

249
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:17,280
I don't know.

250
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,280
Can you talk?

251
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,280
You can't talk.

252
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,280
Please teach me.

253
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,280
Please remember.

254
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:28,280
Young people don't use the phrase.

255
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,280
That may be true.

256
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:36,280
The old man is angry.

257
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:40,280
What? What? What? Tell me.

258
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:44,280
Shirasundo!

259
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,280
What?

260
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,280
Shirasundo!

261
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,280
I don't understand at all.

262
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,280
What? Again.

263
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,280
Shirasundo!

264
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,280
Shirasundo.

265
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,280
What? What? What?

266
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,280
Shirasundo.

267
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,280
What?

268
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,280
Shirasundo.

269
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,280
Shirasundo?

270
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,280
I don't understand.

271
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,280
Shirasundo!

272
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:08,280
Shirasundo.

273
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:15,280
How do you say that? Shirasundo!

274
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,280
I don't think so.

275
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:21,280
In my image, there's a young wife,

276
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:24,280
and the husband comes home from work.

277
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,280
Ah, I'm tired.

278
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:32,280
Today is a little... Shirasundo.

279
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:35,280
That's just the way it is.

280
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,280
You don't have to say Shirasundo all the time.

281
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:40,280
I can't do it straight.

282
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,280
That's not what I'm saying.

283
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:46,280
Why do you always say Shirasundo when your husband comes home from work?

284
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:48,280
That's not it.

285
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,280
But the way I say it is different, right?

286
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,280
I'm a little angry.

287
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,280
I use it when I'm angry.

288
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,280
Is there anything else?

289
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,280
What?

290
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,280
Don't laugh.

291
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,280
What?

292
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:03,280
Kusumaya.

293
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:06,280
What? Kusumaya?

294
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:09,280
What?

295
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,280
Kusumaya?

296
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,280
What?

297
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,280
Kusumaya?

298
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,280
Kusumaya!

299
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:16,280
Kusumaya?

300
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:18,280
Don't talk to yourself!

301
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,280
Kusumaya.

302
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,280
Do you say Kusumaya?

303
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:22,280
Kusumaya.

304
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:26,280
Ah, Kusumaya!

305
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,280
No, no, no, no, no.

306
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,280
That's not it.

307
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,280
I don't think so.

308
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,280
I don't think so.

309
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,280
What is it?

310
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,280
You know, the feeling of baseball.

311
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:39,280
That's not what you're saying!

312
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,280
No, no, no, no.

313
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,280
That's not it?

314
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,280
That's not what you're saying!

315
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:50,280
But you're a bad guy too, Kusumaya.

316
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:53,280
That's not it.

317
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,280
That's not it.

318
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,280
Kusumaya.

319
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:59,280
Kusumaya.

320
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:02,280
That's not it.

321
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:05,280
Itadakimasu!

322
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:08,280
Itadakimasu is fine!

323
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:14,280
Kusumaya!

324
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,280
Don't talk to yourself!

325
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:18,280
Ah!

326
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:20,280
What?

327
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,280
Are you crying? Are you angry?

328
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,280
It's not time to eat.

329
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:26,280
It's not time to eat.

330
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:31,280
Poop!

331
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,280
What?

332
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,280
Poop?

333
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,280
Poop cat!

334
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,280
Poop cat!

335
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,280
Poop cat!

336
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,280
What?

337
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:45,280
What's a poop cat?

338
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:49,280
You're all looking down on me!

339
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,280
What?

340
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:53,280
Are you saying that I'm all dirty?

341
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,280
That's not it!

342
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:57,280
Then don't get angry!

343
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,280
I'm listening!

344
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:01,280
Why are you getting angry?

345
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,280
That's not it?

346
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:05,280
But you said it was poop.

347
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:08,280
You're all pooping!

348
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,280
Kusumaya.

349
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:14,280
Kusumaya!

350
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:17,280
That's amazing!

351
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:19,280
Seriously!

352
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:22,280
You're all pooping!

353
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:25,280
You're saying Kusumaya!

354
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:30,280
The people who are doing it are...

355
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:35,280
Sensei Naenae is doing Kusumaya!

356
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:38,280
Let's introduce the postcards.

357
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,280
Please bring the postcards.

358
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,280
Here.

359
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,280
In the middle.

360
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:47,280
What?

361
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:51,280
This is the queen of Awamori in Okinawa.

362
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:55,280
The queen of Awamori?

363
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:57,280
Awamori is a drink, right?

364
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,280
Yes.

365
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,280
Did you do a lot of things there?

366
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,280
A campaign.

367
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,280
A campaign.

368
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,280
You became the queen?

369
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,280
Yes.

370
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:05,280
That's amazing!

371
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,280
What's your name?

372
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,280
I'm Kuniyoshi Yuko.

373
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,280
Kuniyoshi Yuko?

374
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,280
Yes.

375
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,280
How old are you?

376
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,280
I'm 21.

377
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,280
21?

378
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,280
What are you doing now?

379
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,280
I'm a junior high school student.

380
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,280
A junior high school student?

381
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,280
Yes.

382
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:21,280
Do you do Kusumaya?

383
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,280
You're a star!

384
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:26,280
How many times a day do you do it?

385
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:31,280
Thank you.

386
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,280
This person is from Chiba.

387
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:36,280
Tanaka...

388
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,280
Bibari-san?

389
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,280
Mikari-san.

390
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,280
Mikari-san.

391
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,280
Mikari-san.

392
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:44,280
Lately, there are a lot of boys who come to learn the piano.

393
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,280
They're piano teachers.

394
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:51,280
Do you have any hobbies that you wanted to do when you were little?

395
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,280
A hobby?

396
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:53,280
A hobby.

397
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,280
I didn't do it.

398
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:58,280
But I did karate.

399
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,280
Really?

400
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,280
Even now, I'm confident in this.

401
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,280
What is it?

402
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:06,280
It's Go-kyu.

403
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:17,280
But this is a very strict style, so even Go-kyu is like a normal karate.

404
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:23,280
You have such beautiful fingers.

405
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,280
So I don't have a chance.

406
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:35,280
So even if you try to touch my body, you can't touch me.

407
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,280
I can't lose.

408
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:39,280
When the martial arts club dodges...

409
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,280
I can't dodge.

410
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:43,280
You're like a crane.

411
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,280
I can dodge sideways.

412
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:48,280
I'm Daniel-san.

413
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:54,280
What are you doing?

414
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,280
I was careless earlier.

415
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,280
Really?

416
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:00,280
Earlier, I came to Okinawa and my head was in a daze.

417
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,280
This time, it's okay.

418
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,280
You can't touch me anymore.

419
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:14,280
It's true.

420
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,280
When are you going to stop?

421
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:18,280
I can't make a comment.

422
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,280
If I was doing it too.

423
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:23,280
I didn't do it at all.

424
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,280
You didn't do it.

425
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:29,280
What is popular in Okinawa?

426
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,280
There is a special dance in Okinawa.

427
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:35,280
Everyone can do it, right?

428
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,280
I can do it.

429
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,280
I can't do it.

430
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:42,280
Everyone can do it.

431
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:45,280
I was told to do it when I came here.

432
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:48,280
Everyone can do it, right?

433
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:51,280
I can't do it when I'm an old woman.

434
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,280
The wrist is amazing.

435
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:59,280
It's like a grandmother's wrist.

436
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:03,280
It's like a grandmother's wrist.

437
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,280
I watch it every week.

438
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:08,280
By the way, I have a part-time job now.

439
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:11,280
Did you have a part-time job when you were a student?

440
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:15,280
If you did, what kind of part-time job did you do?

441
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,280
When I was a student?

442
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:20,280
We did a newspaper delivery together.

443
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,280
We did a newspaper delivery together.

444
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,280
This is...

445
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,280
There was.

446
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,280
Was it the Ryukyu newspaper?

447
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,280
No.

448
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:30,280
Why did you come all the way from Osaka?

449
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:34,280
Every day.

450
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:37,280
No, it was in the evening.

451
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:40,280
It was when I was in junior high school.

452
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:43,280
I've been working since junior high school.

453
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,280
I did a lot of things.

454
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,280
Really?

455
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,280
When I started thinking, there was no key.

456
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,280
I did it for the time being.

457
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,280
Newspaper delivery.

458
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,280
Waiter.

459
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:57,280
Central market.

460
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:01,280
And newspaper delivery.

461
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,280
Waiter.

462
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,280
Central market.

463
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,280
It's a little different.

464
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,280
Newspaper delivery.

465
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,280
It's a little different.

466
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:11,280
It's a little different.

467
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,280
Hello.

468
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:14,280
Hello.

469
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:17,280
I went to the market in the afternoon.

470
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,280
I saw a lot of strange things.

471
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:24,280
There are a lot of things that you can't buy in Osaka.

472
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,280
That's right.

473
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,280
There was.

474
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,280
I bought a lot of things in Tokyo.

475
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:30,280
I went to Okinawa.

476
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,280
That's good.

477
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,280
That's good.

478
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:36,280
Why are you tired?

479
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:39,280
Also, the children in Okinawa are doing well.

480
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,280
That's right.

481
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:43,280
We would like to call in the audience.

482
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,280
The audience is...

483
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:46,280
We would like to call in the audience.

484
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:51,280
Mr. Matsumoto from Anagasaki.

485
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,280
It's you.

486
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:58,280
Mr. Hanagata from Okinawa is waiting for you at the booth.

487
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:03,280
Last week, Mr. Matsumoto was waiting for you at the booth.

488
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,280
That's funny.

489
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,280
Mr. Matsumoto from Okinawa.

490
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:09,280
Don't repeat it.

491
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,280
Mr. Matsumoto from Anagasaki.

492
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:16,280
Mr. Matsumoto from Anagasaki.

493
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:20,280
Mr. Hanagata from Okinawa is waiting for you at the booth.

494
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,280
He's waiting for you.

495
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:25,280
Please come to the booth on the second floor.

496
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,280
That's it.

497
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,280
I see.

498
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:31,280
I went to play.

499
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,280
I wasn't caught.

500
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:36,280
I wanted to see the scenery behind me.

501
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,280
I see.

502
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,280
I can't see it if it's dark.

503
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,280
I was looking desperately.

504
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,280
That's right.

505
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:44,280
I was found, but I couldn't see it.

506
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,280
That's why I did this.

507
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,280
I see.

508
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,280
I'm here.

509
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,280
That's all.

510
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:53,280
I don't think there will be any more endings.

511
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:57,280
I'll be in Okinawa again next week.

512
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,280
I'm looking forward to it.

513
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,280
As usual,

514
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,280
I'm looking for a postcard tomorrow.

515
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,280
The address is here.

516
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:08,280
I'm waiting for your postcards.

517
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:11,280
That's all for today.

518
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,280
Goodbye.

519
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:16,280
No, no, no, no, no.

520
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,280
It's hard.

521
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:20,280
A little more.

522
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,280
I'm tired of everything.

523
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:34,280
But I didn't lose a little.

524
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:37,280
I'm tired of everything.

525
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,280
I'm tired of everything.

526
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,280
I'm tired of everything.

527
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,280
Thank you very much.

528
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,280
I hope you'll continue to support us.

529
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,280
I hope you'll continue to support us.

530
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,280
I don't have anything like this.

531
00:22:50,280 --> 00:23:03,280
Thank you very much.
