1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,740
The idol group of 150 hours left directed by Takeshi Yamamoto

2
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:12,000
On the 200 hours

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,620
Takahashi Yamamoto

4
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,080
So...

5
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:26,380
We don't need to waste any more time using Kennedy today, right?

6
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:27,980
It's just one week since we last talked to you.

7
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:28,880
One week just passed?

8
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,880
Last week was also like that, right?

9
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:31,880
Yes, it was like that.

10
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:34,880
The last time, Kin-chan...

11
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,880
You saw everything about Captain Kazuo today.

12
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:37,880
That's right.

13
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:40,880
The other day, I got a phone call.

14
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,880
You made a phone call in Okinawa.

15
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:43,880
The last time, it was Arasuji.

16
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:46,880
Arasuji made a phone call in Okinawa.

17
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,880
You came in with a lot of things to say.

18
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:52,880
And while you were doing that, you went out onto the veranda.

19
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:53,880
And then...

20
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,880
You should have said it sooner!

21
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:58,880
And then you finally passed.

22
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,880
We went to the main event.

23
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:03,880
How many points did you get?

24
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:04,880
What happened?

25
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:05,880
That's a big deal.

26
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:06,880
You saw everything.

27
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:07,880
That's right.

28
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:10,880
It's been a while since you dressed up as Jiro-san...

29
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,880
Ah, not Jiro-san, Kin-chan.

30
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,880
I wanted to see Kin-chan, so I went.

31
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,880
I wanted to see Kin-chan, so I went.

32
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,880
And now you're calling me Jiro-san!

33
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,880
I went to see Kin-chan.

34
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:27,880
It's been a while since you and Kin-chan...

35
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,880
How do you say it?

36
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,880
Free talk.

37
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:34,880
It's such a good thing.

38
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,880
Let's take a look.

39
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:37,880
Please look at the monitor.

40
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:38,880
Here you go.

41
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,880
I told you to look at it.

42
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,880
Did you hear that?

43
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,880
It was all a lie.

44
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,880
It's divided into two parts.

45
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:52,880
Into two parts?

46
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,880
Let's start with the first part.

47
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,880
From the edge.

48
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,880
From the edge.

49
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:12,880
I'm scared.

50
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,880
Let's go to the center.

51
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:15,880
Let's go to the center.

52
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:19,880
Wait a minute.

53
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,880
Let's go to the center.

54
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,880
Matsumoto-san, come on.

55
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:29,880
That's Kin-chan.

56
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:30,880
That's right.

57
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,880
I can't see Matsumoto-san at all.

58
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,880
I'll turn it white in the back.

59
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,880
Is that so?

60
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,880
Thank you for your hard work.

61
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,880
Thank you for your hard work.

62
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,880
Are you okay?

63
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,880
I did my best.

64
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,880
I'll bet on tomorrow.

65
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:48,880
Thank you for your hard work.

66
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:49,880
What did you say?

67
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,880
Thank you for your hard work.

68
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:56,880
Thank you for your hard work.

69
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,880
That's Kin-chan.

70
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:22,880
This time, it's rare to challenge a talent with an ordinary person.

71
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:30,880
Will there be a work that only responds to this cheering?

72
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:33,880
I'm looking forward to it.

73
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:42,880
Good morning.

74
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:43,880
Good morning.

75
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:48,880
Good morning.

76
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,880
I've reached a million subscribers.

77
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:57,880
Thank you for your hard work.

78
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:12,880
I'm nervous before the show.

79
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:22,880
I'm nervous before the show.

80
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,880
I'm nervous before the show.

81
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:39,880
I'm nervous before the show.

82
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,880
Don't you need this?

83
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,880
If I don't have this, I can't run away.

84
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,880
I can only see the line.

85
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,880
You!

86
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,880
You're a slippery woman.

87
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:53,880
Go home.

88
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:54,880
Go home.

89
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:56,880
Go out quickly.

90
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:58,880
Hey!

91
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,880
I'm doing my best.

92
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:05,880
What's this?

93
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,880
You don't have a single pencil.

94
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,880
I'm going.

95
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,880
First of all,

96
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,880
We were the last.

97
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,880
At that time, I didn't have much confidence.

98
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,880
I thought it would be impossible.

99
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,880
What do you mean?

100
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:37,880
If it's more than 15 points, it's a success.

101
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,880
If it's less than 15 points, it's a failure.

102
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,880
I thought it would be impossible.

103
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:46,880
I thought it would be 7 or 8 points.

104
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:53,880
The only judge was Mr. Kanpei.

105
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:56,880
He was the only judge.

106
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:02,880
Mr. Kanpei is like a disciple of us.

107
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,880
I taught him how to write.

108
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,880
I taught him how to write.

109
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,880
That's right.

110
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,880
Mr. Kanpei was there.

111
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,880
He didn't see it because he was nervous.

112
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,880
There was a lamp in front of him.

113
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,880
He didn't see who was the judge.

114
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,880
Who was there?

115
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:24,880
Mr. Masanobu Takashima.

116
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:30,880
Mr. Yamamoto.

117
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,880
Mr. Yukio Aoshima.

118
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,880
Mr. Yumiko Fujita.

119
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,880
The actress.

120
00:06:37,880 --> 00:07:04,880
There are only people who don't understand.

121
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,880
Let's take a look.

122
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,880
You can't just forget the sound.

123
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:16,880
You can't just forget the sound.

124
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,880
Do it yourself.

125
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:24,880
I can't do anything if I do it myself.

126
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:44,880
I'll do it.

127
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,880
This is the last work.

128
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:50,880
This is the last work.

129
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:54,880
This program is the same as the general audience.

130
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:57,880
Please take a look.

131
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,880
And I passed.

132
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,880
Actually, I came last time.

133
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:04,880
I was angry because there was one more work.

134
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:07,880
I passed this time.

135
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:11,880
There may be judges and friends.

136
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:17,880
Please give me a high score.

137
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,880
Let's go.

138
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:23,880
He looks very nervous.

139
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:26,880
He is also the 40th.

140
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:29,880
I'm nervous.

141
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:34,880
Let's go.

142
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,880
No. 40 passed.

143
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,880
What happened?

144
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,880
What is the score of the judges?

145
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,880
What?

146
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,880
I'm sorry.

147
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,880
I'm glad.

148
00:08:55,880 --> 00:09:00,880
Please give me a high score.

149
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:01,880
Are you doing it alone?

150
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:02,880
Yes.

151
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,880
I'm doing it alone.

152
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,880
Did you make it alone?

153
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:06,880
No.

154
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:07,880
What?

155
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:08,880
No.

156
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,880
Who made it?

157
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:10,880
Yes.

158
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,880
Did you make it alone?

159
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,880
Yes.

160
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,880
Please give me a high score.

161
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,880
I made it.

162
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,880
Don't fall.

163
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,880
Congratulations.

164
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,880
I'm glad.

165
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:34,880
I passed.

166
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,880
But I can't win.

167
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:37,880
You want to win, right?

168
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:38,880
Yes.

169
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,880
Please give me a high score.

170
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,880
Yes.

171
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,880
Why are you looking up?

172
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:46,880
Please.

173
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:50,880
Don't step on my foot.

174
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:51,880
No.

175
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:52,880
Don't step on my foot.

176
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,880
No.

177
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,880
No.

178
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:00,880
I have plenty of time.

179
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,880
I made it.

180
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,880
I made it.

181
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,880
I passed.

182
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:17,880
Please help your partner.

183
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:20,880
I passed.

184
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,880
I passed.

185
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:33,880
You don't have to put on makeup like this.

186
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:36,880
You did a good job.

187
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,880
I have three makeups.

188
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,880
Toshi still has three.

189
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,880
I did my best.

190
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:44,880
Thank you very much.

191
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,880
Look at the judges.

192
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,880
Mr. Kanpei.

193
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:49,880
You put on two makeups.

194
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:50,880
Yes.

195
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:51,880
I didn't do it.

196
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,880
I did it.

197
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,880
Mr. Aoshima and Mr. Takao.

198
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:58,880
Everyone is looking at you.

199
00:10:58,880 --> 00:10:59,880
No.

200
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:00,880
You are making fun of me.

201
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,880
The director is noisy.

202
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:04,880
Thank you very much.

203
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,880
You have a good idea.

204
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:10,880
You are using your strength.

205
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:11,880
Thank you very much.

206
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:12,880
You are not losing strength.

207
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:13,880
Yes.

208
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:14,880
You are using your body.

209
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,880
I can feel it.

210
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,880
I felt the same way when I was judging.

211
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,880
I did it.

212
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,880
I'm doing it with my brain.

213
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,880
There was no music room.

214
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:26,880
Yes.

215
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,880
I said it all the time.

216
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:33,880
I said that there was no music room because I wasn't a guest.

217
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,880
I watched it again.

218
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,880
I'm glad.

219
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:40,880
I applied for the audition.

220
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,880
I passed the audition with everyone.

221
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,880
I will talk to you.

222
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,880
I have a wonderful friend.

223
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,880
I'm angry.

224
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,880
I'm very angry.

225
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,880
I'm very happy.

226
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,880
I'm embarrassed.

227
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,880
I'm very happy.

228
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,880
If I had one point, I would like to give it to you.

229
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,880
It's wonderful.

230
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:09,880
But don't give me 1 million yen.

231
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,880
It will be expensive.

232
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:18,880
Congratulations.

233
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,880
I passed the audition.

234
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:25,880
I'm very happy.

235
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:30,880
I'm very happy.

236
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,880
I'm very happy.

237
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:39,880
I'm going to win the 3rd place.

238
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:42,880
I can't see it.

239
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,880
I'm going to win the 3rd place.

240
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:48,880
It's in here.

241
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,880
I think it's in the 2nd place.

242
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,880
Announcement of the 3rd place.

243
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,880
3rd place.

244
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:58,880
No. 35 Waka Hana.

245
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:02,880
Congratulations.

246
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,880
That means, Kin-chan.

247
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:08,880
There are two more.

248
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,880
Are you going to win?

249
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:14,880
I was surprised when the next door came out.

250
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,880
There are two more.

251
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,880
I'm going to win the 3rd place.

252
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,880
I'm going to win the 3rd place.

253
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:29,880
No. 9 Polaroid.

254
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,880
There are two more.

255
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:35,880
That means, Kin-chan.

256
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,880
This is the last.

257
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:40,880
Thank you very much.

258
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,880
Let's hear the announcement.

259
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:48,880
Who will be the winner?

260
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:54,880
Announcement of the winner.

261
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:59,880
No. 13 Hanako.

262
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:07,880
The winner is Hanako.

263
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:12,880
There are people who lost the championship.

264
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,880
Finally, I realized it.

265
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:19,880
Thank you very much.

266
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:22,880
There are two more.

267
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,880
There are two more.

268
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:25,880
Thank you very much.

269
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:28,880
I'm going to win the 3rd place.

270
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,880
I'm going to win the 3rd place.

271
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:34,880
I'm going to win the 3rd place.

272
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:40,880
He is a bit of a joke.

273
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,880
Thank you very much.

274
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,880
Are you going home?

275
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,880
Go home.

276
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:59,880
Thank you very much.

277
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:18,880
There are people who lost the championship.

278
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,880
That's it.

279
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:30,880
This time, the level was higher than usual.

280
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,880
That's why it was bad when I came out.

281
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:41,880
The three or four people who won the championship were amazing.

282
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,880
I'm going to win the championship.

283
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:48,880
Why didn't you team up with him?

284
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:52,880
Why didn't you team up with him?

285
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,880
It was amazing.

286
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,880
I got 19 points.

287
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,880
It was good.

288
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,880
Give it to me.

289
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:07,880
I have a medal.

290
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:13,880
This is a medal.

291
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:16,880
This is amazing.

292
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:20,880
This is KIN-CHAN's signature.

293
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:21,880
It's hard to get.

294
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:25,880
It says line 40.

295
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:28,880
I have this.

296
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,880
Why did you bring this?

297
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:31,880
It's a gift.

298
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:35,880
This is a gift from our staff.

299
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:38,880
This is a gift from the commander.

300
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:39,880
I'm sorry.

301
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:48,880
This is the medal you were wearing.

302
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:53,880
You were pooping in brown before.

303
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:58,880
I don't know if I re-painted it.

304
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,880
I got 19 points.

305
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,880
I didn't win the championship.

306
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:06,880
I got 19 points.

307
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:11,880
I didn't win the championship.

308
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:18,880
I didn't wear the medal before I won the championship.

309
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,880
I won the championship once.

310
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,880
I don't know who won the championship.

311
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:28,880
If it was FUJITA, I'd forgive him.

312
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:29,880
AOSHIMA-CHAN...

313
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,880
CHAN!

314
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:32,880
AOSHIMA-CHAN!

315
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:37,880
I think he's wearing it because it was a good chance.

316
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:40,880
I'll check the video.

317
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,880
You'll see who didn't wear it.

318
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,880
The one who didn't wear it.

319
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,880
That guy!

320
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:50,880
There was no one who got 20 points.

321
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,880
That's right.

322
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:52,880
There was no one.

323
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,880
I don't know if I got 20 points.

324
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,880
I got some awards.

325
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:00,880
I didn't get any awards.

326
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,880
It's all because of FUJITA YUMIKO.

327
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,880
What are you going to do next time?

328
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,880
Next time...

329
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:11,880
How many times are you going to compete?

330
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,880
As I said before...

331
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,880
I'm going to do a bird-human contest.

332
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,880
Really?

333
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,880
I was surprised.

334
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,880
Why are you going to do a bird-human contest?

335
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,880
You didn't do that last time.

336
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:24,880
Why?

337
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,880
Why?

338
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,880
You're going to fly from 10 meters away.

339
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,880
You're going to die.

340
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,880
You're KIN-CHAN flying in the sky.

341
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:37,880
What?

342
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:40,880
Do I have to do KIN-CHAN's make-up again?

343
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:41,880
Are you stupid?

344
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,880
That's not it.

345
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:46,880
That's too much.

346
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,880
Next time, do JIROU-SAN.

347
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:49,880
I'll do it.

348
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,880
I'll do it.

349
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,880
You should do it.

350
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,880
You're going to die.

351
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,880
I was flying in the sky the other day.

352
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:03,880
Which do you think is more difficult, skydiving or this?

353
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:06,880
Me!

354
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:07,880
Are you stupid?

355
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,880
How difficult is this?

356
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:14,880
You're going to die if you say it's hard.

357
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:15,880
I'm really scared.

358
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,880
You're not scared.

359
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,880
That height.

360
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,880
You can only fly this high.

361
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,880
I don't understand you.

362
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,880
I don't understand you at all.

363
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,880
It was amazing.

364
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:31,880
When I went to the top, my mouth was dry.

365
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,880
That's me.

366
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,880
I really understand you.

367
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,880
Are you stupid?

368
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:40,880
Next time, we're not going to do bird-human.

369
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,880
What is it?

370
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:43,880
One letter.

371
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:44,880
Are you going to do it?

372
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,880
I'm going to do this.

373
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:50,880
I'm going to call the people who are watching this on TV.

374
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:51,880
Let's do it together.

375
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,880
I was going to do it together.

376
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,880
What are you two doing?

377
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,880
You can't see it, right?

378
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:04,880
What are you two doing?

379
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,880
I don't want to do this.

380
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,880
What are you two doing?

381
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,880
What are you two doing?

382
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,880
What is it?

383
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,880
You're saying strange things.

384
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:21,880
If it's hard to see, I'll get you a big pair of sunglasses.

385
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,880
It's hot.

386
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:26,880
If the weather is good, let's burn it.

387
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:27,880
It's hot.

388
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,880
My throat is dry.

389
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:32,880
Let's do a simulation.

390
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,880
It's on the show, right?

391
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,880
The one-letter one.

392
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:37,880
Are you going to do that?

393
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:38,880
I'm going to do that.

394
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:39,880
I'm going to do that.

395
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:40,880
And before that...

396
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:41,880
Practice.

397
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:44,880
Let's practice.

398
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:45,880
Let's try it.

399
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,880
Have you decided what to do?

400
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:48,880
I've decided.

401
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:49,880
What?

402
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:50,880
What are you going to do?

403
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:51,880
This is one-letter.

404
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,880
Let's play a lot.

405
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,880
In a different sense.

406
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:56,880
In a different sense.

407
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,880
Let's gather everyone.

408
00:20:58,880 --> 00:20:59,880
Let's go somewhere.

409
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:00,880
What are you going to do?

410
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,880
Everyone is a goldfish.

411
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,880
That's right.

412
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,880
Everyone is dressed like a goldfish.

413
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,880
About 1,000 people.

414
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:09,880
While doing this.

415
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:14,880
I'm going to walk around the river.

416
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:15,880
What are you going to do?

417
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:16,880
Are you going to take it from above?

418
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,880
I'm going to take it from above.

419
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:20,880
It's disgusting.

420
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,880
It's disgusting.

421
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:26,880
When I'm walking, the soccer ball comes flying.

422
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,880
About 1,000 people will kick it.

423
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:35,880
About 10,000 foreigners will come running.

424
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,880
Jogging.

425
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:45,880
When I shout, I'm a goldfish.

426
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,880
That's good.

427
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,880
That sounds interesting.

428
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:53,880
I'm going to beat up the guest, Kato Masaru.

429
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,880
There was a scene where I beat him up.

430
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,880
You are my student.

431
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:02,880
I'm going to beat him up with 5,000 people.

432
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,880
I'm going to break.

433
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:09,880
Let's do that before the show.

434
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:10,880
That's right.

435
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,880
Let's do it.

436
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,880
It doesn't matter if you're a goldfish or not.

437
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:18,880
Is there anyone who wants to be a goldfish?

438
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,880
There is.

439
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,880
There is.

440
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,880
It's not cool.

441
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,880
Really?

442
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,880
Please.

443
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:33,880
If you have short hair, please grow it out.

444
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:36,880
I can't do that.

445
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,880
I have something to bring.

446
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:43,880
A mouse-colored jacket.

447
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:49,880
And a thick tie.

448
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:52,880
I'm going to bring this.

449
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,880
I'm counting on you.

450
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,880
If you have time, practice like this.

451
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:01,880
Next, let's interview you.

452
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,880
Make an appearance.

453
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:06,880
I actually looked up a word.

454
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,880
It's a lot.

455
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,880
And it wasn't goldfish but thunder seal.

456
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:15,880
Thunder seal was very terrible.

457
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,880
I don't care about that story.

458
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:22,880
I'm not too sure.

459
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,880
It was fun.

460
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,880
That's enough!

461
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:28,880
How many people do you think I'll need to hire?

462
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,880
I don't know.

463
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:34,880
I'll see you next time.

464
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:35,880
Bye!

465
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:59,880
This program was brought to you by these sponsors.
