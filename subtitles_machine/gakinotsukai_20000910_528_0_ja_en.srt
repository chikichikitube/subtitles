1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Tadakata!

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
It's been a while since I've seen...

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
What is this?

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
My voice is getting hoarse.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
What is this?

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
It's been a while since I've seen Akasaka...

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Bwa...

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
It's been a while since I've seen Akasaka...

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I don't like this guy.

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I don't want people to laugh at me for saying things that I don't mean to say.

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I'm laughing at you.

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
It's like a theater in Akasaka.

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Oh, that's right.

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
The dressing room is upstairs.

15
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Yes.

16
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
But it's like it's coming down.

17
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
It's coming down from the top.

18
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
It's coming up on it's own.

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
This program is brought to you by these sponsors.

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I'm a bit tanned, right?

21
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
You went to the court?

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I went to the court.

23
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
It's summer vacation.

24
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
It was a summer vacation. But on the first night, when I was sleeping at the hotel,

25
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I remembered that Saipan was really famous.

26
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Ah, the ghost.

27
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I remembered that and was really scared.

28
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
From the second day, I went to hug Yamazaki.

29
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I was really scared.

30
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Don't lie to me like that.

31
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I didn't mean to hug him, but we slept together in Yamazaki's room.

32
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I was a little scared.

33
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
How many times did you hook up with her?

34
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I didn't hook up with her. Because Saipan wasn't there.

35
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
She wasn't there.

36
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
It was just my family.

37
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
It was true.

38
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
My acquaintance found you.

39
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Ah, in Saipan?

40
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Yes.

41
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
What was the situation like?

42
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I went into her room and saw her.

43
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
She wasn't there.

44
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
You must be lying.

45
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Don't lie to me like that.

46
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I heard it.

47
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Don't lie to me like that.

48
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Don't lie to me like that.

49
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I've been lying to you for a long time.

50
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
You're married and have children.

51
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
You shouldn't lie to me like that.

52
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I don't know if you're saying this because you're single.

53
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
But if you're single, you'll have a lot of dreams in the future.

54
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
You'll meet a lot of people in the future.

55
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
You'll crush them all.

56
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
No.

57
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
If I'm found out, will there be someone like that?

58
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
What?

59
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
It's not that I won't be found out.

60
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
It's not that I won't be found out.

61
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I don't want to be found out by this guy.

62
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
It's not that I won't be found out.

63
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
You understand, right?

64
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I'm the one who has a lot of dreams in the future.

65
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
It's not that I won't be found out by this guy.

66
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
It's not that I won't be found out by this guy.

67
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
You're a fool.

68
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
So why don't you want to be found out?

69
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
That's because...

70
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I'm not single.

71
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I don't want to be found out.

72
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I don't want to be found out.

73
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
You should have told me honestly.

74
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
That's right.

75
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
What is this?

76
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Let's say there's someone who's about to get caught.

77
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
It's just an example.

78
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
You don't need an example.

79
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
If there's someone who's about to get caught,

80
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
and they ask,

81
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Are you playing in the court?

82
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
And you say, I don't want to.

83
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
What will happen to my love?

84
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
What will happen to my love?

85
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I want to tell you that.

86
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
That's right.

87
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
There's no way that your partner will crush your love.

88
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
That's right.

89
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,000
You're a person who needs to help me with my love.

90
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
And if my love goes well,

91
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I'll work harder.

92
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I'll work harder.

93
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I'll work harder.

94
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I'll work harder.

95
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
If you're a jockey,

96
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
you'll have to kick my ass.

97
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
If you do that to my love,

98
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I'll be flustered.

99
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I'll be like, that's enough.

100
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I'll be like, do you want to go abroad?

101
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Do you want to go abroad?

102
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I'm sorry.

103
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I shouldn't have said that.

104
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
That's not true.

105
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
That's not true at all.

106
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Why are you laughing?

107
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I'm sorry.

108
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
That's not true at all.

109
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Why is that?

110
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
If I knew about your relationship with your girlfriend,

111
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I would have said,

112
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
thank you very much.

113
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
And I would have called the staff.

114
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Hey, cut that part out.

115
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
What?

116
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I don't have a staff member.

117
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I want to do anything for you.

118
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
So please go home and watch the show this Sunday.

119
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
The things I've said so far,

120
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I'll cut a little bit of it.

121
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
That's just a matter of time.

122
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
It's the opening line today.

123
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I don't want to say too much.

124
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Who is that?

125
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
A friend from high school.

126
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
A man?

127
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Yes, a man.

128
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,000
That man saw me taking a woman into my room?

129
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Yes, he did.

130
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:30,000
It's connected.

131
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
It's connected.

132
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
It's connected.

133
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
The trial will come out after all.

134
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
What?

135
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I don't know.

136
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
You guys went in normally.

137
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Did you see me doing this?

138
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I think you saw me going in from behind.

139
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
It's completely connected.

140
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
It's scary.

141
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
The trial is scary.

142
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I don't know if it's like that.

143
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I don't know.

144
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I was scared.

145
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I went to the casino.

146
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Have you ever been to the casino from the trial?

147
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
No.

148
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
It takes 50 minutes by boat.

149
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Really?

150
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Yes.

151
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I was in a bad mood, so I went to the casino.

152
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
It takes 5 or 10 minutes by boat.

153
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
You have money.

154
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
What are you talking about?

155
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
It's not like that.

156
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
You have money.

157
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
You have money.

158
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
You have money.

159
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
It's a dirty casino.

160
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
A casino?

161
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
No.

162
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
It's like gambling.

163
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
It's like gambling.

164
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
That's fine.

165
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:53,000
The pilot was an old lady with a bow and arrow.

166
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Old lady?

167
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
It's really scary.

168
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
It's just a bow and arrow.

169
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
It's true.

170
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
My hands are covered in blood.

171
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
The old lady's bow and arrow is interesting.

172
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
A black man took me there.

173
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I thought he would ride with me.

174
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
But the old lady was riding with me.

175
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I thought he was a candidate.

176
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I thought he was a candidate.

177
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,000
When I got on the boat, I was like a fool.

178
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,000
The old lady was riding with me.

179
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:45,000
My hands were covered in blood.

180
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
The old lady's bow and arrow is interesting.

181
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
It was really scary.

182
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
When I got on the boat, I was waiting for a taxi.

183
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I was waiting for a taxi at the airport.

184
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
The old lady was waiting for a taxi at the airport.

185
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I was waiting for a taxi at the airport.

186
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I took out an aluminum foil from my bag.

187
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I ate something.

188
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
It was really scary.

189
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I didn't think I would die because of this old lady.

190
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
But she was a great old lady.

191
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
She was a great old lady.

192
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
It was really scary.

193
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
But there was nothing.

194
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I'm glad there was nothing.

195
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
How long were you there?

196
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
About three days.

197
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
About three days?

198
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Yes.

199
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
There were a lot of Japanese people, right?

200
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
There weren't many Japanese people.

201
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Tourists?

202
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Tourists?

203
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Tourists?

204
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
There were a lot of tourists, right?

205
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Tourists?

206
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:36,000
What do you want me to say?

207
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Can I say something?

208
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:48,000
But can I speak as I am?

209
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,000
The audience is small and I can't say anything.

210
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I can't say anything.

211
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I can't say anything.

212
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
If I speak as I am, it's not interesting.

213
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
It's not fun.

214
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I'm serious.

215
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Are you kidding me?

216
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Don't be so cocky just because I took you to my room.

217
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
What do you mean?

218
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Oh, I did it!

219
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Everyone, look at this.

220
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
My sweat.

221
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I'm standing on my knees, aren't I?

222
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
My sweat.

223
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Don't be so cocky just because I took you to my room.

224
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
My sweat.

225
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Wait a minute, is that all?

226
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Really?

227
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
What?

228
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Really?

229
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
What's with that face?

230
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Dirty. You're dirty.

231
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
If I had to rephrase it, you're dirty.

232
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
It hasn't changed.

233
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
It hasn't changed at all.

234
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I'm going to take a dump.

235
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I'm sure you're getting better at editing.

236
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
You're going to pee?

237
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Isn't that obvious?

238
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
How are you going to pee?

239
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
When I took a dump, I peed!

240
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
If that's not good enough,

241
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
When I took a dump, I peed!

242
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
When I took a dump, I peed!

243
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I don't understand a thing you're saying.

244
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Even someone who hasn't been trained properly would understand.

245
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Once again, I have a question for Mr. Matsumoto.

246
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
What would you do if someone took your bag?

247
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:01,000
What would you do if someone took your mount?

248
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I see, I see.

249
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I don't know how many of you know what a mount is.

250
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
They say that if you take a mount, it's the best thing for you.

251
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
If you take a mount, you can't do anything from the bottom.

252
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
You can't do anything.

253
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:22,000
That's right. You can't take my mount.

254
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I'll let you take it.

255
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
What should I do?

256
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Please take the mount.

257
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
What is this?

258
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Let me take it.

259
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Let me take it.

260
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Let me get on top of it.

261
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Let me get on top of it.

262
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Please take the mount.

263
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Can I just cross my legs like this?

264
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
There's something like this.

265
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Like this.

266
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Like this.

267
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
How did you take it?

268
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
This isn't a mount.

269
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
There are people who misunderstand this as a mount.

270
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
This is a mount.

271
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
This and this are completely different.

272
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
If you do this, you can't do anything.

273
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I'm doing it like this.

274
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I can't do anything.

275
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
It's not like I'm holding your hand.

276
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I can hit it from below, but it doesn't work because it doesn't have a waist.

277
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I see.

278
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
That's why I have to do this to make it hit me.

279
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
But if I do this, I can't do anything.

280
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
That's why it's hard.

281
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
What do you do when you get hit?

282
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I got it.

283
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Please remember this situation.

284
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
What are you doing?

285
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Wait a minute.

286
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Stand up once.

287
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Stand up once.

288
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
What are you doing?

289
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
You have a really amazing face.

290
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Do you understand?

291
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Please remember this situation.

292
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
You can't do anything.

293
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
What do you do when you get hit?

294
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I got it.

295
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
It's hot.

296
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
It's hot, isn't it?

297
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
This is hot.

298
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Let's go.

299
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
What are you going to do?

300
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I'll let you take the mount.

301
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I'll let you take the mount.

302
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I'll let you take the mount.

303
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I'm taking the mount.

304
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I'm taking the mount.

305
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Let's go.

306
00:13:53,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Come on.

307
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Take the mount.

308
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Can I throw it?

309
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
It's a tackle.

310
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
It's a tackle.

311
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:25,000
It's a tackle.

312
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
You want to take the mount, don't you?

313
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Yes, I want to take it.

314
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
You can't do this.

315
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
You can't do that at all.

316
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
That's...

317
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Were you able to do that?

318
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,000
You bastard.

319
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Because...

320
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
You can't take the mount.

321
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
You'll get hit.

322
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:52,000
That's not right.

323
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
You said you want to take the mount.

324
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
That's not right.

325
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
That's a molecule and a molecule.

326
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
What is that?

327
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I don't get it.

328
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
What is that?

329
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
You said you want to take the mount.

330
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
What is that?

331
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
That's not right.

332
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
It's like this.

333
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
It's like this.

334
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
It's like this.

335
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
When you take it...

336
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:23,000
It seems like you're cheating.

337
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:43,000
What are you doing?

338
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
You were really fast with just your hands.

339
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Please tell us how to take care of your ears.

340
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
How to take care of your ears.

341
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
How to take care of your ears.

342
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
If you've heard anything about this, you won't lose anything.

343
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I won't lose anything.

344
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
There's nothing that doesn't work.

345
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
What?

346
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
You mean for illness?

347
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Yes.

348
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Really?

349
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Yes.

350
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
For example, bald people get hair.

351
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
That's difficult.

352
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:17,000
People with a broken jaw won't lose anything.

353
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
What?

354
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:26,000
People with a broken jaw won't lose anything.

355
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
People with a broken jaw won't lose anything.

356
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I don't know how bad it is.

357
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Compared to before.

358
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Really.

359
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
That's definitely true.

360
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I want to be like that.

361
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I want to have a better body.

362
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
It works for everything?

363
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
It works for everything.

364
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
For example, people who are fat want to lose weight.

365
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Of course.

366
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
That works the best.

367
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
You should have said that first.

368
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
It's too obvious.

369
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I didn't want to say it.

370
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I see.

371
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I'm sorry.

372
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I like this shirt.

373
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I don't like long sleeves.

374
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I want to wear short sleeves.

375
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I thought it would work for that.

376
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
What should I do?

377
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
It doesn't work for me.

378
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
It works for that.

379
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Please tell me.

380
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I don't have an earpick.

381
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I can't do it.

382
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
It's okay to have one.

383
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
You have an earpick.

384
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
You have an earpick.

385
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
What are you doing?

386
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
It's okay.

387
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I'm not an amateur.

388
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Yes.

389
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:42,000
What are you doing?

390
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
What are you trying to do?

391
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
It's a rhythm.

392
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
What about an earpick?

393
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I don't have an earpick.

394
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
What are you doing?

395
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I have five earpicks here.

396
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:03,000
If you don't have five or ten earpicks, you can have one.

397
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I don't have an earpick.

398
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:22,000
What should I do?

399
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Let me hear your opinions.

400
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
What should I do?

401
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I'm just singing.

402
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Think of it like a radio exercise.

403
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:39,000
What was it?

404
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
It's like a folk dance.

405
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:51,000
What was it?

406
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
It's all rhythm.

407
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
It's an exercise for earpick.

408
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
You have to remember the song first.

409
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I got it.

410
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
What are you talking about?

411
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I don't need lyrics.

412
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
If you don't remember the lyrics, you can't dance.

413
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:21,000
What are you talking about?

414
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
What are you talking about?

415
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I'm not talking about music.

416
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
You're talking about something.

417
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I'm not talking about music.

418
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I'm talking about the atmosphere.

419
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I'm talking about the atmosphere.

420
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I'm talking about the rhythm.

421
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
You don't have to say anything.

422
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I don't care.

423
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
If you don't have to say anything, don't say it.

424
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I don't know if it's the same thing.

425
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
If you don't know how to say it, you'll remember it.

426
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I can't say it if I don't have to say it.

427
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I can't say it if I don't have to say it.

428
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
I can't say it if I don't have to say it.

429
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
It was a little funny.

430
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I can't say it if I don't have to say it.

431
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
You can't say it.

432
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I can't remember it.

433
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
What are you talking about?

434
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
You have to remember that first.

435
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Sunomono, sunomono, sunomono.

436
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
What is that?

437
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
What is that?

438
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,000
It's called sunomono.

439
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:28,000
It's called sunomono.

440
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
It's called sunomono.

441
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
SU.

442
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
NU.

443
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Suno.

444
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Sunomono, sunomono, sunomono.

445
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Sunomono, sunomono, sunomono.

446
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Sunomono, sunomono, sunomono.

447
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
I'll do it.

448
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I'll do it.

449
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Sunomono, sunomono, sunomono-san.

450
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Sunomono, sunomono, sunomono-san.

451
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I didn't do anything.

452
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Let's start from here.

453
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Let's start from here.

454
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Sunomono, sunomono, sunomono-su.

455
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Don!

456
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Sunomono, sunomono, sunomono-san.

457
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
What is that?

458
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
I just pointed it out.

459
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,000
I just pointed it out.

460
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I just pointed it out.

461
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,000
I'll ask the person in charge.

462
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
You have to say it's just like that.

463
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Yes.

464
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
You have to say it's just like that.

465
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Sunomono, sunomono, sunomono-san.

466
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Sunomono, sunomono, sunomono-san.

467
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Yes, don!

468
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Sunomono, sunomono, sunomono-san.

469
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Don!

470
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:59,000
You have to say it's just like that.

471
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:16,000
I did it too much, so I'll do it again.

472
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:22,000
It's hot.

473
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Happy birthday to you.

474
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Happy birthday to you.

475
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Happy birthday dear my darling.

476
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Happy birthday to you.

477
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Good job.

478
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Let's toast as usual.

479
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:49,000
There's one person who's looking down.

480
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
He seems to have forgotten.

481
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
On behalf of everyone, Mr. Yamasaki, please.

482
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Happy 37th birthday.

483
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Well then, I'll leave it here.

484
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
What do you mean?

485
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:14,000
From now on, Yoshimoto Ninawa Kokoriko will...

486
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Are you ready?

487
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
You don't have to be Ninawa anymore.

488
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
I'll give up.

489
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
You can't do that anymore?

490
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Yes.

491
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
No.

492
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,000
What?

493
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
So...

494
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Shouldn't it have ended like that?

495
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Well then...

496
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Why?

497
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Kokoriko...

498
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,000
It's like a cake.

499
00:23:49,000 --> 00:24:11,000
This program was brought to you by these sponsors.
