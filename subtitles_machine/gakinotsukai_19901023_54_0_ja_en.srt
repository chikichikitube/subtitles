1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
A great plan!

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Hello!

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Good evening!

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Welcome!

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Today, my staff and my boyfriend are not here.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
We're looking for them.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Are you serious?

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Yes, I'm serious.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:30,000
We have 5 of them here today, so if you have the same feeling as our staff, you can go out with them.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I wonder if we'll get along.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
First, let's have the ladies come on stage.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Ladies, please come on stage!

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
What's your name?

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Yoshiko Nakahama.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
How old are you?

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I'm 21 years old.

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm Yuki Takahashi.

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
How old are you?

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm 21 years old.

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
How old are you?

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I'm 5 months old.

22
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
You're 5 months old.

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
You don't look like you're in trouble.

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Did you get dumped when you broke up?

25
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
What?

26
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Did you get dumped?

27
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Yes.

28
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Oh...

29
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
You're 5 months old!

30
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm Miyoko Ooura.

31
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm 23 years old.

32
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I'm Akiko Yamaguchi.

33
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm 23 years old.

34
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'm Reiko Yamamoto.

35
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm 22 years old.

36
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I haven't been here for 22 years.

37
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Well then, let's go!

38
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
It's finally time for the ten men to come on stage!

39
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
This is so much fun!

40
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I can't take it anymore!

41
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Number 1, this is Nitta Atsuo.

42
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Your father is an atelier, right?

43
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
That's right.

44
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
A director?

45
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Are you a director?

46
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Sakamoto-chan, you're D, aren't you?

47
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
You're lying!

48
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I've always been an AD.

49
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
And then...

50
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Irie-san.

51
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
B-san.

52
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
B-san of B-san.

53
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
B-san of B-san.

54
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
In this era of Heisei,

55
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
there's the Gingham check.

56
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
That's a high point, isn't it?

57
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Ootomo.

58
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I'm a little...

59
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I'm a little excited.

60
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Why?

61
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Why?

62
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Ootomo is...

63
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Why?

64
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Ootomo-kun's drawing has been going around lately.

65
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
It's become a little Tengu.

66
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
It's become Tengu.

67
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I see.

68
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Adachi Motoichi.

69
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Yes.

70
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Look at this jumper.

71
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
It's the worst.

72
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
It's a camera.

73
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Normally, you'd have to stand there.

74
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Isn't that a surfer?

75
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
No.

76
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
It's not a surfer?

77
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
No.

78
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Why do you have a beard?

79
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
You look like a surfer.

80
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Right?

81
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
You're just an Eskimo.

82
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Is she a girl instead of a surfer?

83
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
This guy is quite...

84
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
An Eskimo.

85
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Come on.

86
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
A pervert.

87
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
We often go to karaoke together.

88
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
When I go to Keats,

89
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I bring a girl I don't know.

90
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
See? See?

91
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
See?

92
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Hey, Hama-chan.

93
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
You're there, aren't you?

94
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
You're there, aren't you?

95
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
You're there, aren't you?

96
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
You're there, aren't you?

97
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
You're there, aren't you?

98
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I bring a girl I don't know.

99
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
You're just a pervert.

100
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
You look like a surfer.

101
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Really.

102
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
You look like a surfer.

103
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I'm Taka-san.

104
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I'm a broadcaster.

105
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I'm a broadcaster.

106
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
We're from the same town.

107
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I'm a broadcaster.

108
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I'm a broadcaster.

109
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I'm a broadcaster.

110
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I'm a watchmaker.

111
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I'm a watchmaker.

112
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
It's amazing.

113
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
He's a villain.

114
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
He's the chief director.

115
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
He's in charge of everything.

116
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
He's in charge of everything.

117
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
He's in charge of everything.

118
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I stopped growing up when I was in 6th grade.

119
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Five female members.

120
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
The first impression is good.

121
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
From number 1 to number 10.

122
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
From number 1 to number 10.

123
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
It's good.

124
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Five members.

125
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
We'll count them now.

126
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I thought you were wearing a mask.

127
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Number 1.

128
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Number 2.

129
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Number 3.

130
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Number 4.

131
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Number 5.

132
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Number 7.

133
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Number 9.

134
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Step forward, please.

135
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
These people...

136
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
are...

137
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
and the others are...

138
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Goodbye!

139
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
No way.

140
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
You know...

141
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
We were wearing masks.

142
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Who...

143
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Who was wearing masks?

144
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Check your numbers.

145
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Number 2.

146
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
What are you all riding?

147
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
All of us.

148
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
What are you all riding?

149
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I don't buy it.

150
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
You don't have much money?

151
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I don't like it.

152
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I don't like it.

153
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I don't ride a car.

154
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I don't like it.

155
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I don't like it.

156
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I don't like it.

157
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I don't like it.

158
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
It's called a Hilux Surf.

159
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
It's a 4WD.

160
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
It's like a 4WD GV.

161
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
It's big.

162
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
It's popular.

163
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
It's an AD.

164
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
It's an AD.

165
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
It's a new car.

166
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
It's two years old.

167
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
This is my light truck.

168
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
You're wearing a jacket.

169
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
You're riding a light truck.

170
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
This is the busiest place in the center.

171
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
We don't ride a lot.

172
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
We don't ride a lot.

173
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Yamato-san.

174
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I heard you often go out to play.

175
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Where do you go out to play?

176
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
What do you do to play?

177
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I see.

178
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I was taken by Matsumoto-kun to an SM club.

179
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Everyone, you have to tell the truth.

180
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
The people watching are going to get the wrong idea.

181
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Why?

182
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I'm the one who gets the blame.

183
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Hey!

184
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
If you were to compare yourself to someone, who would you compare yourself to?

185
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
It's only once in a long time.

186
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
To Tahara Toshihiko.

187
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
That was when Tahara Toshihiko wasn't around yet.

188
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
How much do you practice?

189
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I think this is an honest question.

190
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Of course, it's the same with marriage.

191
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Just going out with someone isn't enough.

192
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Don't look so serious!

193
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
This chair suddenly became this long.

194
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I think it's about 2.5 million yen.

195
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Really?

196
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
That's a bonus.

197
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Every week?

198
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Yes.

199
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
About 1.8 million yen.

200
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I think it's about two or three times as much as a regular salaryman.

201
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
That's pretty expensive.

202
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
How much is it?

203
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
It's 2.5 million yen.

204
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
If it's 2.5 million yen, then it's about 2.5 million yen.

205
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
If it's 2.5 million yen, then it's about 2.5 million yen.

206
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Hey, you!

207
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
What kind of question is that?

208
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
What kind of question is that?

209
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Someone who goes around the world.

210
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
To be honest, which do you like more, Machan or Hama-chan?

211
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
If I'm going to be honest with you,

212
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I don't like either of them.

213
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
What number is your first girlfriend?

214
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Number 9.

215
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Number 9.

216
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Takasu.

217
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
What kind of music is that?

218
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
It's going to be a mess.

219
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Number 9.

220
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Number 9.

221
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Number 4.

222
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Number 4.

223
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Oh, Tomo.

224
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
What kind of reaction is that?

225
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Okama.

226
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Number 4.

227
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Number 7.

228
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Number 7.

229
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Yanaoka.

230
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Number 9.

231
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I got 3 Taka-san.

232
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
But to get Nitta-san, I couldn't get it all.

233
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Because you're going to see it, put it on your cheek.

234
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
It's ok?

235
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
You're full of motivation.

236
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Hello, everyone.

237
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Today, we're going to use all of the kids.

238
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Today's opening was fun.

239
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Today's opening was amazing, wasn't it?

240
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Oh, really?

241
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
That's how it is on the show?

242
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
That's right.

243
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
You ate garlic.

244
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Sorry.

245
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I ate it in the middle of the day.

246
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
You're pregnant with your wife and you're eating garlic.

247
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Where do you get that from?

248
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
It's not like...

249
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
It's not just that I eat garlic because I'm pregnant.

250
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I went to the train station the other day.

251
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
There was a nervous waitress.

252
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
What's that?

253
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
It's not because it's you.

254
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
It's because I'm a high-ranking talent.

255
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
That's enough!

256
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
What's high-ranking?

257
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
What?

258
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
It's because I have a lot of talent.

259
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
That's enough.

260
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
When a high-ranking talent comes, the waitress gets nervous.

261
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I don't get nervous, but I'm nervous because I'm a high-ranking talent.

262
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
It's interesting to see a nervous person.

263
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
It's interesting to see a nervous person trying to suppress it.

264
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
They come to me.

265
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
What's wrong with me?

266
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I'm not like that at all.

267
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
That's because there are people like that.

268
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
This person and that old man over there are the same.

269
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
They're all the same.

270
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
They're trying their best to separate themselves.

271
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
There were three people who ordered.

272
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
They ordered iced coffee, Americano, and so on.

273
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I said, okay, I got it.

274
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
And they left.

275
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
And over there, in this trench,

276
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
they had iced coffee and Americano.

277
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
They were all piled up.

278
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Hurry up!

279
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Right?

280
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
All the people who ordered were ready.

281
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
And they came to our table.

282
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
They said, welcome.

283
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
What would you like to order?

284
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Really?

285
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
That's what they said.

286
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Really?

287
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
That's what they said.

288
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
It's true.

289
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
How many years has it been since they came to our house?

290
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
That's right.

291
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
It's interesting to see a nervous person.

292
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
You don't get nervous, do you?

293
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
What?

294
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
You don't get nervous.

295
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I don't get nervous.

296
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Have you ever felt like your body was shaking?

297
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I was really nervous.

298
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:46,000
The skydiving that was done on this show.

299
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I was really scared.

300
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I was really scared of the cold.

301
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Other than that, nothing.

302
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Other than that?

303
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Nothing.

304
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Your body was shaking.

305
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Like a newborn baby horse.

306
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
That's right.

307
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
That's a yakuza.

308
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I've never been involved with a yakuza.

309
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
When I was involved, it wasn't a big deal.

310
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I was scared about 5 or 6 years ago.

311
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
That's because you touched a yakuza woman.

312
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I didn't touch her.

313
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
No, that was...

314
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I didn't touch her.

315
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
That's true.

316
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
No, no.

317
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
If you did that...

318
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
No, no.

319
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I didn't touch her.

320
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
So...

321
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
That's not true.

322
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
My friend...

323
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
My friend has a fan.

324
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
He wanted me to touch her.

325
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I said no, no.

326
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
That's not true.

327
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Don't say that.

328
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I said no, no.

329
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Oh?

330
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I said, just once.

331
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I said, just once.

332
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I didn't touch her.

333
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Her makeup was really thick.

334
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I like it.

335
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
She looked like a girl I liked.

336
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I like her a lot.

337
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I like girls who are pure and innocent.

338
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Pure and innocent?

339
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Right?

340
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I thought it was hard.

341
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I didn't want to touch her.

342
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
So I said no.

343
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Why did you go to her room?

344
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I sent her to the apartment.

345
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I'm a gentleman in comedy.

346
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Shut up!

347
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I sent her to the bottom of the apartment.

348
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
She said she wanted to go to the top.

349
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
So I said I'd have a cup of tea.

350
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I thought I could have a cup of tea.

351
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I didn't want her to be rude.

352
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
She's my wife.

353
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
She's your wife.

354
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I thought I could have a cup of tea.

355
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I'm a man.

356
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Don't say unnecessary things.

357
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Don't say unnecessary things.

358
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
She's the apple of my eye.

359
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
She's the apple of my eye.

360
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
What do you mean?

361
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
She has a big heart.

362
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
She went to the top.

363
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
It was about the ninth floor.

364
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
She went in.

365
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
She was like an angry woman.

366
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
When she went into her room, she started to sing.

367
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
With a loud voice.

368
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,000
She didn't want to do anything.

369
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
She was drinking tea.

370
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
She was singing.

371
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I thought she finished singing.

372
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
It was so noisy that I couldn't hear her.

373
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
When she finished singing,

374
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
She opened the door.

375
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
He kicked the door.

376
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:43,000
That's an amazing sound!

377
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
At first, I thought it was Bon-chan's song.

378
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I thought the next song was Anne-Louise's song.

379
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I don't think Anne-Louise can sing a song like this.

380
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
It's definitely different.

381
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
He kicked the door.

382
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
And he lived with that woman.

383
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
He has a spare key.

384
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I asked him why he kicked the door.

385
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
He said it was just a chain.

386
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
The door was open.

387
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
It was like in an occult movie.

388
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
You could see his face.

389
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I couldn't see his face.

390
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I couldn't see his face.

391
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I couldn't see his legs.

392
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I couldn't see his legs.

393
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I couldn't see his legs.

394
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
It was like he was a newborn baby.

395
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
He said,

396
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I can't open it!

397
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
That's terrible.

398
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
He's a big boy.

399
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
You're pulling a man again.

400
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
He's doing it again.

401
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
He likes women.

402
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Open the chain!

403
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
If I open it, I'll be killed.

404
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
That woman is also very brave.

405
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I don't know who should open it.

406
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
You shouldn't say that.

407
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Why shouldn't I open it?

408
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Don't say that.

409
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
You shouldn't say that either.

410
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I thought you shouldn't open it.

411
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
If I open it for a while,

412
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
the man won't come back.

413
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I thought he went back.

414
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
He won't come back.

415
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
After a while, he'll come back.

416
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Will he come back?

417
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I just called a young man.

418
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
If you open the chain right now...

419
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
It's really scary.

420
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
It's really scary.

421
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,000
That woman is also a member of that group.

422
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Her father is also a member of that group.

423
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
That woman is also very strong.

424
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
My father is...

425
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I don't think I should open it.

426
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
That man kicked her again.

427
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I just called Mr. Tsukaguchi.

428
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Who is that?

429
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Tsukaguchi said something.

430
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I don't know, but he looks bad.

431
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,000
But this woman is the daughter of the leader of the Yakuza.

432
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I thought Mr. Tsukaguchi wouldn't come.

433
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Then that woman said,

434
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Why are you calling Mr. Tsukaguchi?

435
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Let's go to the postcard.

436
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Postcard.

437
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Thank you.

438
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Let me introduce you.

439
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:20,000
This woman is...

440
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Yuka Teranishi.

441
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
She was born in Tokyo and went to Fukuoka once.

442
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Then she came back to Tokyo.

443
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Why did she go to Fukuoka?

444
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
She is the ostrich of the circus troupe.

445
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
What is the ostrich of the circus troupe?

446
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
The leader.

447
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Do you have a boyfriend?

448
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I recently had a boyfriend.

449
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
But she is pretty cute.

450
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
You can have a boyfriend soon.

451
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
That's right.

452
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Good luck.

453
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
This is one of the things.

454
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I'm going to get a man.

455
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
If you come to this program, someone will definitely ask for your phone number.

456
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Please check it out later.

457
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I think someone will ask.

458
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Thank you very much.

459
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Let's move on to the next postcard.

460
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Let's see.

461
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Let's go to this person.

462
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
This is from Kawasaki City.

463
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Hello, Mr. Okunohama.

464
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
You suddenly woke up in the middle of the night.

465
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Here it comes.

466
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Your girlfriend was sleeping next to you.

467
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
She was sleeping next to me.

468
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
You chopped the part where she was sleeping.

469
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
You woke her up.

470
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
What are you talking about?

471
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
You suddenly chopped her.

472
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
This way.

473
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
What are you talking about?

474
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
She was angry.

475
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
And you said,

476
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Thank you for the meal.

477
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
You fell down and fell asleep.

478
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Thank you for the meal.

479
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
When you were drunk,

480
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
when you fell asleep,

481
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
if you did something like this,

482
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
please tell me.

483
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Got it?

484
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I fell asleep?

485
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Yes.

486
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
You wrote down what you did.

487
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
That's right.

488
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
I don't know if you went shopping and fell asleep,

489
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
but you said that.

490
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
That's right.

491
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I just happened to see this.

492
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I saw my dream when I was flying.

493
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I got this.

494
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I baked in the car.

495
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
And then I woke up.

496
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
There are a lot of it recently.

497
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Maybe it's because she didn't sleep deeply.

498
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I snore.

499
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
You do.

500
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I snore a lot.

501
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Only that is not careful.

502
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Also, you should be careful of that.

503
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
snoring and smoking.

504
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
You can't get it right away.

505
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
What are you talking about?

506
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:40,000
You light up a cigarette and leave it on the table.

507
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I've never seen you smoke so many cigarettes.

508
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Your cigarettes are amazing.

509
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Really?

510
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Really.

511
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
There's no oil on the table.

512
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
There's definitely going to be a fire.

513
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
It's obvious.

514
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Your wife and you are smoking.

515
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
I'm sorry.

516
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
There's a menu.

517
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
It's like a drift show.

518
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
There's definitely going to be a fire.

519
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
You have to be careful.

520
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Lately, I want to be your manager.

521
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Really?

522
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I said that today.

523
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
She wants to be your manager too.

524
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
What's wrong with being a manager?

525
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
It's a big deal to be a housewife.

526
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,000
It seems like Nitta is slowly getting sick.

527
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Is that so?

528
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I didn't have Nitta at first.

529
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I was a woman's manager.

530
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I quit after three days.

531
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I couldn't keep up with her.

532
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Then Nitta came.

533
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Yoshimoto has a lot of managers.

534
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Nozawa's manager is amazing.

535
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
He's 100% fat.

536
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
He's amazing.

537
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Look, he's fat.

538
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
His house is a butcher's.

539
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
He's fat and has twins.

540
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
This is amazing.

541
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
If it was just one person, what kind of fat would he be?

542
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:10,000
If it was just one person, he wouldn't have twins.

543
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Everyone's going to be surprised.

544
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I think that's enough for today.

545
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Isn't that enough?

546
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I think that's enough.

547
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
We have to do this.

548
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Yes, yes, yes.

549
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Please give us some goods.

550
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Which one should we give them?

551
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Let's give them something interesting.

552
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I think I'll give this guy a helmet.

553
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Is that so?

554
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Yoko Izumida-chan.

555
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Please give me Mach-chan's helmet.

556
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
I'm a laborer.

557
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
I can't do it without it.

558
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
I'll get scolded by my boss, so please give it to me.

559
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
I can't help it.

560
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
It's nice.

561
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
This is a helmet.

562
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
I'll give you a helmet.

563
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
I'll give you this.

564
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
I don't want it, so I won't give it to you.

565
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
That's right.

566
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
I want to wear Mach-chan's helmet.

567
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
I don't want it.

568
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
I want to wear it anyway.

569
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I won't give you this either.

570
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
There are a lot of helmets.

571
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
I'll give you this.

572
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Suemoto Yuko-san.

573
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
I'll give this guy a plate.

574
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Yes, yes.

575
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I'll give it to you.

576
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Congratulations.

577
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Thank you very much.

578
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,000
That's all for today.

579
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
There won't be much sound today, will there?

580
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Thank you very much for today.

581
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
See you next week.

582
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Hello.

583
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:53,000
As I said before, I have a letter for you.

584
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
The person who was read during the program.

585
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Suemoto Yuko-san.

586
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
I'll give you this.

587
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
This is from Terese.

588
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I'll give you this.

589
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
I'll give it to you.

590
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Read it.

591
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
And...

592
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I'll give you a letter.

593
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,000

597

The outfit at that time.

602
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
It's a gold-haired outfit.

603
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000

I'm a child's servant.

609
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
I'll write something and put it in front of you.

610
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
You can get a jumper.

611
