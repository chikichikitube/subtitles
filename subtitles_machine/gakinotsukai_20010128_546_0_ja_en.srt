1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Please get along with me

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I can't get along with you

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I'm sweating so much

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
The most important event of the new year is the comic contest

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Number 9

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Matsumoto?

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Yes

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Congratulations

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
No matter if you win or lose, it's important to win the competition

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Number 1

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Okamanya! Okamanya!

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
This is how the 6 teams were decided

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Hamada and Endo's team

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Matsumoto and Okamasa and Shishio's team

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Yamazaki's Trio and Tanaka's Pinguet

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
A fun face-off

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Endo!

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
And the top batter is this duo

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The two of them went to look for their father's child

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
And ended up finding Endo's a**

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
How did this cowardly skit come about?

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Let's take a look

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
This year has come again

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
It's the year of the new king

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Look at this, there's a lot of stuff

26
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
What should we do?

27
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Should we do it alternately?

28
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
For the two of them to do a skit, they will do it alternately

29
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
But the problem is, what kind of skit will they do for the new year?

30
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
That's the biggest problem

31
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
This is the one that looks like a dog

32
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Probably

33
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
What is this?

34
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Hamada's idea was to use Endo's a**

35
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Endo's a**

36
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Endo, are you okay with that?

37
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'm fine

38
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I think it's funny

39
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
The front is a bit unnatural

40
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
It's open

41
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Should I wear the jersey on the front?

42
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
You can wear it like this

43
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
You can wear it like this

44
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I took it out earlier

45
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
How is it?

46
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
The training went smoothly, and the snake year skit is complete

47
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Don't move

48
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
The theme is snake year

49
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
It's finally time for the two of them to appear

50
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Hello

51
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
It's the 21st century

52
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I was thinking of doing my best

53
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
But everyone is saying 2001

54
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Please come to Shibuya

55
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Everyone is saying 2001

56
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
What? Who is saying that?

57
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Everyone is saying 2001

58
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Everyone is saying 2001

59
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Endo, don't move

60
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Endo, don't move

61
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Endo, don't move

62
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Endo

63
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
What's wrong?

64
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
There's a moon

65
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Hamada-san, this is a**

66
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Thank you

67
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
What is this?

68
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
You guys are the worst

69
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
You guys are the worst

70
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
You guys are the worst

71
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
You guys are the worst

72
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
With the dirty strategy of the top batter

73
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
It became difficult to do it

74
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Other combinations with amateur staff

75
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
This year, more than 0 years

76
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Many combinations have slipped

77
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Tanaka, who decorated the bird, is also in this situation

78
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
After all, you couldn't win

79
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Among them, Yamazaki was the worst

80
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
There was such a reason behind that cold and broken skit

81
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
While other combinations were doing well

82
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Yamazaki Toh

83
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
He doesn't want to do it at all

84
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I can keep it

85
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
That's right, I know that

86
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I'm frustrated with that

87
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
As expected, Heipo is also in a hurry

88
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
He can't hide his frustration

89
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
What is that?

90
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Saigo-san, what are you doing?

91
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Don't be serious

92
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
That's it

93
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Master, please

94
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
What is the suggestion that Yamazaki made?

95
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
To be honest, ad-lib

96
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
All of them?

97
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Yes

98
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
This is the result

99
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
You bastard

100
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
This is the first time in the 21st century

101
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
It slipped

102
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Only once in 4 years

103
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Among them, Matsumoto and Okama characters

104
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
The combination of the broadcast writer Shiono, who was noticed

105
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Shiono, who represented the Shidoni Olympics

106
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Shiono made a lot of jokes and invited the audience to laugh

107
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
What was behind the scenes?

108
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I wiped the salt

109
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
The meeting with Matsumoto began

110
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Shiono is confused

111
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
In the name of a foreigner

112
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I only say the kanji of the Shimo

113
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I can't say such a thing

114
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I can't say the name of the curry

115
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Curry Lewis

116
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Shiono made a mistake

117
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I wiped the salt

118
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
The joke of Shiono was completed

119
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Matsumoto

120
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Shiono

121
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Together

122
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Together?

123
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I didn't turn off the lights and put on the gloves

124
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I wiped the salt

125
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Can you speak louder?

126
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
You are so real

127
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
You are a technician

128
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
You are a fool

129
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
What are you doing?

130
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
But that was completely one

131
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
What are you doing?

132
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Shiono, who hasn't shown it yet

133
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
What kind of combination will be born next year?

134
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Don't fall in love with me

135
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Don't fall in love with me

136
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Hamada's

137
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Hamada's ears

138
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Don't fall in love with me

139
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Don't fall in love with me

140
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
It's like an influenza

141
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
You have a hoarse voice

142
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I also have a hoarse voice

143
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
You have a hoarse voice

144
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I don't know the difference between an influenza and a cold

145
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I have a hoarse voice

146
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I have a hoarse voice

147
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
At that time, I will continue to wear gloves

148
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Please accept it

149
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I want you to be my companion

150
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I don't have a hoarse voice

151
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I still have a hoarse voice

152
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I'm almost healed

153
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I will be a great master

154
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I don't know which is the master

155
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
There is always a master

156
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
After this, I will be a great master

157
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
You are bigger than that

158
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I have a hoarse voice

159
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Do you have something?

160
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I have something

161
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:15,340
I was investigating the

162
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I was investigating the

163
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
What?

164
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I was investigating the

165
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I don't care

166
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I don't care if you have a hoarse voice

167
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
It's not something that can be improved

168
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
It's not

169
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
What is NHK?

170
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
This is a big problem

171
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
This is a big problem

172
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
This is a difficult thing

173
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
The more we appear, the lower the hoarse voice

174
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
It can't be helped

175
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
People often think

176
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Are you okay?

177
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
What is that?

178
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
It can't be helped

179
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
What is it now?

180
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I want to improve

181
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Do you want to improve?

182
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I want you to do a real exchange

183
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I want you to do a real exchange

184
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Who is the most beautiful?

185
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Everyone is kind

186
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
But the kind is justice

187
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
But the kind is justice

188
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,000
The courage to fight is also justice

189
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
You have to fight when you fight

190
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I don't care

191
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
It's the talent's courage

192
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
You have to fight when you fight

193
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
You have to fight when you fight

194
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
It's easy to get hated

195
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
You don't have to be poisonous

196
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
You don't have to be poisonous

197
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
You're angry

198
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
You don't give up

199
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
You don't give up

200
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
You don't give up

201
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
It's not like that

202
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I don't know what you're talking about

203
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
We have to move forward

204
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I really want to show my heart

205
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I really want to show my heart

206
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
It's pure

207
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
It's pure

208
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I don't know

209
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I cry when I see a puppy

210
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I don't know if you understand that

211
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I'm sad that the people don't have the power to see that

212
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Who do you ask to do the NHK exchange?

213
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
The people who watch NHK

214
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
They're old

215
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
But the young people do it

216
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
But the young people don't do it

217
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Even if you want to be hugged

218
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,980
At the time of posting

219
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
You will be the label as an ordinary woman

220
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
If you don't want to be hugged

221
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
You will be called a pervert

222
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
You are the woman whose chilli applicants don't want to be hugged

223
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
That's forgetful

224
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
There's the consideration problem

225
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
You're not going to say you are angry

226
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
No

227
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Why do you like Takuya Kimura so much?

228
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
That's true.

229
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
You can't help but want to see him!

230
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Do you want to see him that much?

231
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
That's not in the numbers.

232
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I said I want to see him!

233
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Get out of here!

234
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
If you put up the internet at 9pm...

235
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
It looks hot.

236
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
It looks really hot.

237
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
What do you like about him?

238
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
That's not in the numbers.

239
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
It's in the 30s.

240
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
It's in the 30s.

241
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I think I'm more refreshing.

242
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I think he's more refreshing.

243
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Do you like him that much?

244
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
If he's here, I don't think so.

245
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
He's next door.

246
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
It's true.

247
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
When I said I wanted to see him...

248
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
It's a little strange.

249
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
It's a little strange.

250
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I understand that.

251
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
He doesn't do anything on Wednesdays at this time.

252
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
He doesn't do anything on Wednesdays at this time.

253
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I understand that.

254
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
He doesn't do anything on Wednesdays at this time.

255
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I understand that.

256
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I understand that.

257
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I didn't think I needed that kind of technology.

258
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
But I found out that I can do the magic trick.

259
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Wait a minute.

260
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
You can't win against Ikkoku-do.

261
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I was watching Ikkoku-do the other day.

262
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I thought he was amazing.

263
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I thought he was amazing.

264
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I thought I'd give it a try.

265
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I can't do it.

266
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I'm surprised.

267
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,000
To be honest, I can do it, so I can't laugh.

268
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I can't move my mouth.

269
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
What do you want me to say?

270
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
What do you want me to say?

271
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I'll do it.

272
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Stop it.

273
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
You're amazing today.

274
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
You're not moving your mouth.

275
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
You're not moving your mouth.

276
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I'm not moving my mouth.

277
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Close your mouth.

278
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Close your mouth.

279
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I can't move my mouth.

280
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I can't move my mouth.

281
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
You can't move your mouth.

282
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
You do it.

283
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Like this?

284
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
You're amazing today.

285
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I can't move my mouth.

286
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
You're not moving your mouth.

287
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
You're amazing today.

288
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I did it, right?

289
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
You're not moving your mouth.

290
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I did it, right?

291
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I'm not moving my mouth.

292
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I can't move my mouth.

293
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
It's not open.

294
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
This is how you talk.

295
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I can't do that because I'll only look at my mouth.

296
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
If you close your mouth like that, it'll close.

297
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
The one with the time difference

298
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I love you

299
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
No, but...

300
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
No, it's done

301
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I'm fashionable, so it's done

302
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Today too, with Matsuki's card, you can buy things

303
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
It's finally here

304
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
With 7 special benefits, Matsumoto Kyoshi member card

305
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
You can get the card for free

306
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
You have to enter

307
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Hey, don't they look like they have a fever?

308
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Hey, look, they have a fever

309
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Look, they're coughing

310
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Listen to me for a moment

311
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Let's talk about it when we catch a cold

312
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
The wind is so persistent

313
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
At that time, Perak's cold medicine

314
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Only Matsukiyo

315
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Gold chip star

316
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Do you know this?

317
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
This time the gold is...

318
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Super hot

319
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Hot and spicy

320
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Spicy chili

321
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Wow

322
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Nabisco chip star

323
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
New flavor on sale

324
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Gorgeous

325
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I'll take this

326
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Can you fight for 24 hours?

327
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Literally

328
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
From noon to midnight

329
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
From dawn to noon

330
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I'll hit you without a break

331
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
This is Amdes Fighting Festival

332
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Tomorrow's Marumiere

333
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
It seems to be similar

334
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Hey, is it expensive?

335
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Various

336
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I want to, I want to, I want to

337
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Room, room

338
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Looking for a room

339
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Hey

340
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Household information

341
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Humanity

342
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
From Dekrute

343
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Humanity

344
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Change the destination of the car

345
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
A completely new way of thinking

346
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
131 people died in an accident

347
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
The man survived unscathed

348
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
What do you think it means?

349
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Are you ready to know the truth?

350
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Unbreakable

351
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Unbreakable

352
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I have a question for the vice president of the World Bowling Association

353
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Yes

354
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
It is said that there were four holes in the bowling ball

355
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,000
At that time, what were you putting in the fourth hole?

356
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,000
After all, what you don't need will disappear

357
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Right?

358
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Before the bowling was so popular, it was necessary at first

359
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Four?

360
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Yes

361
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Now it's like this

362
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
It's like this

363
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Right?

364
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Now it's like this

365
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
In the old days

366
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
In the old days, there was another small one here

367
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
There was a small one around here

368
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Why is it so far away?

369
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
What?

370
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
It was under here

371
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
It was to put your fingers in, right?

372
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
No, it was to put your fingers in

373
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
It was for different purposes

374
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
No, it was for different purposes

375
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
What was it for?

376
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I put some soy sauce

377
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
And

378
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
The rain was sticky

379
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:01,000
The rain was sticky

380
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:06,000
No matter what kind of food you make, you must never compromise

381
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
That's true

382
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Please tell us three important tips to make the best ramen in Japan

383
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Can I say this?

384
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Why?

385
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:27,000
To be honest, it's the best business

386
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I'll tell you

387
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,000
This is a big problem in the world

388
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Is that so?

389
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Yes

390
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I don't know if it's better to turn off the sound

391
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Ramen Jiro

392
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Do you have it?

393
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I've been here a few times

394
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,000
It's thick

395
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:57,000
But I want to eat it again

396
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
What kind of soup is it?

397
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Do you have some?

398
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Ramen Jiro is fine

399
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,000
But I don't know what it tastes like

400
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:13,000
When I was eating it, it was so big

401
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:18,000
But when I looked at it, Jiro was hiding

402
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
No

403
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Really

404
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Jiro was hiding?

405
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Yes

406
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Jiro was hiding

407
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I couldn't see it for a second

408
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
What do you mean by Jiro was hiding?

409
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
It was in my head

410
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Think about it

411
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
The name of the ramen shop is the name of most people

412
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
What does that mean?

413
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:44,000
I want to catch the person who makes the best soup

414
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
It's not fair

415
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
You can't just use that person's name

416
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,000
The name of the shop is not important

417
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
This is really true

418
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
If you want to make ramen, please consult

419
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
But you don't know who makes the best soup

420
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
That's right

421
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,000
That's why the best soup is ***

422
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,000
That's why

423
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Catch it

424
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
You might make a mistake

425
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
It might be spicy

426
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Wash it

427
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Wash it before you put it in

428
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,000
If you wash it, it will be soaked in the soup

429
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
That's right

430
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,000
You have to make it delicious

431
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:38,000
You should have looked at it while you were running the shop

432
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Jiro was hiding

433
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
He was trying to run away

434
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
That's right

435
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:49,000
I think that's why people say it's a ***

436
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
You say that you can't say this

437
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,000
This is a corporate secret

438
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
You can't say that

439
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Because it's a person

440
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
The name of the store is correct

441
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
It's covered with ***

442
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,000
This is the goal

443
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:26,000

There are so many good cars

448
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Which one are you talking about?

449
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
No, it's not a Nano Road

450
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000

Hello Swiss

460
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
What should I do with the car insurance?

461
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
40% off?

462
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Until the accident?

463
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
It's not just an accident

464
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
From now on, car insurance

465
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
This is it

466
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Hello?

467
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Hello Swiss

468
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Yes, it is a utility fee

469
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Oh, it's not a utility fee

470
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
I changed it to a cheap one

471
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
It's completely different

472
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I don't know what it tastes like

473
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
It's better to be delicious

474
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
It's better to be delicious

475
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
The middle high of the high

476
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
After all it's here

477
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
The realm of possibility exists here

478
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
It's a lifetime of excitement and shock

479
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Give her another chance

480
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
For me

483
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Question

484
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Why is the A-class donut less effective?

485
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Answer

486
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
It's because it's a double-layered structure

487
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Is this the image?

488
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
That's right

489
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I see, I see

490
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
A-class donut

491
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000

Bridgestone

493
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:06,000
People who repair cars often lie down and lie under the car

494
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
What are you doing?

495
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
If I had to say

496
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,000
After all, there's no way you can do that much

497
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
I've asked for car repair

498
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Those people work really hard

499
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
That's because they like cars

500
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
For a living

501
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
For work

502
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
For work

503
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Of course they have that kind of pride

504
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
But even so, they work too hard

505
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Is that so?

506
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Yes

507
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
I've thought about it a lot

508
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
I looked at it

509
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
That thing

510
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
It's sucking in car juice

511
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
It has a story

512
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
It's supposed to be sweet

513
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
You've never tasted it

514
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Apparently it's sweet

515
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,000
It's the sweet smell of Tokonatsu's coconut

516
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
What's with the car juice?

517
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,000
If you ask me what car juice is

518
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
The story is over

519
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
It's there

520
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
You turn on the engine

521
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
It's there

522
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
What's so good about it?

523
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
It doesn't matter if it's a parking lot

524
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
You turn on the engine for a while and leave it alone

525
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
You move it and look at it

526
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:17,000
The car juice is coming out

527
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
It's that

528
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
If you leave it alone

529
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,000
The car juice is coming out

530
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Is that car juice?

531
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
It's amazing

532
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:31,000
It's sweet

533
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Is that sweet?

534
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
It's not sweet

535
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
You've never drunk it, right?

536
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
I have

537
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
What are you talking about?

538
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:43,000
There's a lot of azuki

539
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,000
I don't think many people know that it's sweet

540
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Really?

541
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
But there's no way sweet juice comes out of the car

542
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Why?

543
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Where's the sweet juice?

544
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Where's the sweet juice in the car?

545
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
You really don't know anything

546
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
I don't know

547
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
I'll tell you

548
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Where does the sweet juice come from?

549
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
It's raining

550
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:15,000
There's a bit of sugar in the rain

551
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:19,000
There's no sugar in it

552
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:23,000
The power of the wiper is amazing

553
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
From the tip of the wiper

554
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
While doing this

555
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
It comes out

556
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Sugar

557
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,000
There's something wrong

558
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
You put gasoline in it, right?

559
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Yes

560
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
It's that time

561
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,000
There's usually something sweet in it

562
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
It's like a tank

563
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
You open the lid and do it

564
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
While doing that

565
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
You put something sweet in it

566
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,000
You put something sweet in it

567
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,000
