1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
In the first episode, let's clean up Chikitsuki!

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
This is an educational program.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
We want you to understand that it's dangerous to do this.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
We have a lot of things prepared.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
We use a microwave.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
This is dangerous. This is OK.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
This is the set.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Please sing a song of the microwave.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
It will start soon.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
It came suddenly.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I thought it would come suddenly.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
There may be times when you don't use it.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
You can use it until winter.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
That's the worst.

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
That's no good.

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:01:03,000
There may be a second one next time.

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
This program is provided by the sponsor you are watching.

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Let's start with the first shot.

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Are you ready?

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Anything is fine.

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I don't know.

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Do you want to put it in?

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Let's put it in.

24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I don't like it.

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I don't like it moving.

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
It's hot.

27
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I don't like it.

28
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I'm scared of the sound in front of me.

29
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Something is coming.

30
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Everyone is getting bigger.

31
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
It's coming.

32
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
What is that?

33
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
What is that faint sound?

34
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
It's getting bigger.

35
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
It's true.

36
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
It's coming.

37
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
It stopped.

38
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
What is that?

39
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
What is that?

40
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
What is that?

41
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
What is that?

42
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
A yo-yo is made of a balloon.

43
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
There is water in it.

44
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:29,000
If you turn on the microwave, the water will expand.

45
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:37,000
The water expanded and the balloon came out.

46
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Take it off.

47
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Are you okay with the oxygen?

48
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I'm fine.

49
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I'm scared.

50
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
It's coming.

51
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
What is that?

52
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Look at the balloon.

53
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I'm scared.

54
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
The balloon is going to float.

55
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
The balloon is going to float.

56
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Let's eat.

57
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Is this a ginkgo nut?

58
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
It's delicious.

59
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Is it salty?

60
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
It's delicious.

61
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
What is this?

62
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
What is this?

63
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
What is this?

64
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
What is this smell?

65
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,000
It smells like a yo-yo player.

66
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,000
It's fast.

67
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
It's amazing.

68
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
It's amazing.

69
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
It's amazing.

70
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
It's amazing.

71
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:05,000
It's amazing.

72
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
What's next?

73
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Let's eat this.

74
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
It's interesting.

75
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:22,000
This is the one with brown rice.

76
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I don't know.

77
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
It's over.

78
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:41,000
It's over.

79
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
It's beautiful.

80
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:57,000
It's over.

81
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:04,000
It's about to catch fire.

82
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
It's a bad guy.

83
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:16,000
It's a bad guy.

84
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:26,000
It's a bad guy.

85
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I see.

86
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
What's next?

87
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Let's eat this.

88
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Start.

89
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I'm scared.

90
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
It's leaking.

91
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:45,000
It's not warm.

92
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
How was it?

93
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,000
It's not warm.

94
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,000
It's interesting.

95
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
It's amazing.

96
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
It's rice cake.

97
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
It's a clam.

98
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:12,000
It's cute.

99
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Let's go to Keiko-do.

100
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
How many seconds is Keiko-do on the menu?

101
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
It's not on the menu.

102
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Let's go.

103
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Start.

104
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Let's go.

105
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Do I press here?

106
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
You can't stop it.

107
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
It's on.

108
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Stop it.

109
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Stop it.

110
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Keiko-do has two lights.

111
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
The light is on by the electrician.

112
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
The light is on by the electrician.

113
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
The light is on by the electrician.

114
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:17,000
The light is on by the electrician.

115
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Let's eat the boss's egg.

116
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
It looks like a desk.

117
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Let's go to work.

118
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I want to eat the boss's egg.

119
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I can ride on it.

120
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Really?

121
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I can ride on it.

122
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I can ride on it.

123
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I can ride on it.

124
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I can ride on it.

125
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Why do you hit my head?

126
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I'm a professional bowler.

127
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I'll start.

128
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:01,000
It's heavy.

129
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
It's really amazing.

130
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I'm sweating.

131
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
It looks like a dinosaur egg.

132
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:41,000
It looks like a dinosaur egg.

133
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
The outside of the egg is empty.

134
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
The inside of the egg is full of water.

135
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
The pressure inside the egg is increasing.

136
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
If the egg is empty, it will burst.

137
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
You need to be careful.

138
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
It's important to read the instructions.

139
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:04,000
It's important to read the instructions.

140
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Put it on your head.

141
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
What?

142
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Put it on your head.

143
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Are you all right?

144
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Are you all right?

145
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,000
The other day, I was drunk at the sea.

146
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
The other day, I was drunk at the sea.

147
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I did a Christmas special.

148
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
The guests came with a bowl.

149
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Because it's Christmas.

150
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Merry Christmas.

151
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
The first group was good.

152
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
The second group was good.

153
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Let's toast.

154
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Merry Christmas.

155
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I was drunk at the sea.

156
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,000
The sea was moving.

157
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
The sea was moving.

158
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I ate rice properly.

159
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I ate rice properly.

160
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I drank a lot.

161
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
The other day, I drank a lot.

162
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I drank a lot.

163
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I had 12 bottles of alcohol.

164
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I had 12 bottles of alcohol.

165
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I jumped into the head of 10 people.

166
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I jumped into the head of 10 people.

167
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I've been recording the whole time, and you didn't show up.

168
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I'm not lying.

169
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Your face was all red, and you didn't show up.

170
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
That's not good.

171
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
That's not good.

172
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
You didn't say a word in the last part of the glove.

173
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Actually, this is the first time I've heard about the glove.

174
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
This is the first time I've heard about the glove.

175
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Really?

176
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I'm sorry.

177
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
It's okay.

178
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Right?

179
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
It's not fun to watch.

180
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
You announced the glove, right?

181
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
The other day, right?

182
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Yes.

183
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
How is it?

184
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
This year.

185
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
How is it this year?

186
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I wonder how it will be this year.

187
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Who did you become?

188
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Matsutaka.

189
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
You don't know, right?

190
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Why is that your face?

191
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I don't know.

192
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Your invisible power is working.

193
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Why is that?

194
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
If you say your invisible power is working, you're an a**hole, right?

195
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
It's like Norio Yoshio.

196
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
What is it?

197
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Don't you really think so?

198
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
If you say you're an a**hole and you want to retire,

199
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
they'll treat you well in the newspaper.

200
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
No one cares.

201
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
What is an a**hole?

202
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
No one knows that.

203
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
That world is limited.

204
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Right?

205
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
If you say you're an a**hole and you want to retire,

206
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
they'll treat you well in the sports newspaper, right?

207
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
If that's the case,

208
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
you shouldn't be treated as a bigger a**hole than Okahachiro.

209
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Right?

210
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
But Okahachiro is in a small place.

211
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
If you say your invisible power is working,

212
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Okahachiro is a bigger a**hole.

213
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Why are you pushing Okahachiro?

214
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Okahachiro is a bigger a**hole than Okahachiro.

215
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Everyone knows that.

216
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Everyone knows that.

217
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
It's totally different.

218
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
The name value.

219
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Out of 100 million people,

220
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
how many people are fans of Okahachiro?

221
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Right?

222
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
That's right.

223
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
It's about 10,000 people.

224
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Okahachiro's fans are 40,000 people.

225
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Wait a minute.

226
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
My book has 40,000 people.

227
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Wait a minute.

228
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Okahachiro's fans are the same.

229
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Wait a minute.

230
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
You're a bigger a**hole than Okahachiro.

231
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I'm a bigger a**hole than Okahachiro.

232
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Do you know Okahachiro?

233
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I don't.

234
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
You don't?

235
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I'm a bigger a**hole than Okahachiro.

236
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
You're just an old man.

237
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
No no no.

238
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
A big old man.

239
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
You're underestimating Okahachiro.

240
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Old man.

241
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
If Okahachiro appears, you'll be surprised.

242
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
What are you talking about?

243
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
You've gotten old.

244
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I don't know that much.

245
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Do you know Okahachiro?

246
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Yes.

247
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
You do know?

248
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Even Okume no Hacchyan.

249
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
That's right!

250
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:45,000
She even says Okume no Hacchan.

251
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
This girl is from the Kansai area, isn't she?

252
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
See?

253
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
That's right, or else she wouldn't even know Okume no Hacchan.

254
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
That's not it.

255
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I'm starting to want to call Okahachi.

256
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I just want to say it.

257
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Huh?

258
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
What?

259
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Ah!

260
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
What's this?

261
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Ah!

262
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Eh, what's this?

263
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Ah, it's George.

264
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
What was it again?

265
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Ah, there it is!

266
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I'll do my best!

267
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I'll do my best!

268
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Ah...

269
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I just want to say it.

270
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:34,000
From now on, from now on...

271
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:46,000
It's warm.

272
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Is that so?

273
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Thank you very much.

274
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Thank you very much.

275
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
It's something to say, isn't it?

276
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
It's true.

277
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
It's hot.

278
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:58,000
It's hot, but it means it's warm.

279
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Masumoto-san, you've been protecting Hamada-san for 15 years in every way.

280
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:10,000
If Hamada-san and Masumoto-san were walking outside together, the wind would always blow, and Hamada-san's back would fly off.

281
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
It would be a mess.

282
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Masumoto-san, what would you do first?

283
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
This is...

284
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
It's a very good letter, isn't it?

285
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Well, it's a if.

286
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
It's not a letter.

287
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
It's a story of what would happen if it happened.

288
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
It's a very difficult thing, isn't it?

289
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
No, it would fly off.

290
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
It doesn't matter what you say.

291
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I'm the type of person who can't forgive things that have happened to Hamada.

292
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
At first, when the two of them were walking, I thought, oh, the wind is strong.

293
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
After all...

294
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:49,000
He always pulls out the string that he always puts inside.

295
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
And he pulls it tight like this.

296
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
It's like a straw hat.

297
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
He pulls the string tight like this.

298
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,000
He doesn't want the string to get caught in the string.

299
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
That's impossible, but...

300
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I have some money, too.

301
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
If I really didn't pull it out, I wouldn't pull it out.

302
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
That's right.

303
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
You wouldn't pull it out like that.

304
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:18,000
That's why when the wind was strong, I pulled it out like this.

305
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
That's why it's not a team fight.

306
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
It's not a win-win situation.

307
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
It's not like that.

308
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
It's not like that.

309
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
It's not like that.

310
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I was walking, and the wind blew.

311
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
When it flew off, I was facing the wind.

312
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I was like, what the hell?

313
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Let's say it.

314
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Thank you.

315
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I was angry with the wind.

316
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I was angry with the wind, and then...

317
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
No, I was chasing you.

318
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
What?

319
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
You're already...

320
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I'm not saying you should be angry, but I'm chasing you right now.

321
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
You have to come back as soon as possible.

322
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:04,000
When the wind blew, I was like, what the hell?

323
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
When I looked at you, you were already chasing me.

324
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I was like this.

325
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I was like this.

326
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:21,000
This is a question for Mr. Matsumoto, who is looking for a part-time job to be a part-timer.

327
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I'm working part-time now, but I'm in trouble because the hourly wage is low.

328
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
That's why I'd like to ask Mr. Matsumoto.

329
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Mr. Matsumoto used to do it, and he still does it sometimes when he's in trouble with money.

330
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Please tell me about the part-time job for 86,000 yen.

331
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
You were doing it?

332
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I was already doing it.

333
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Oh, really?

334
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Yes.

335
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:46,000
The hourly wage was 86,000 yen, and I ended up paying 86,800 yen.

336
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I started with 85,000 yen at first.

337
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
What kind of job is it?

338
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:57,000
It's a part-time job.

339
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:04,000
That's too much.

340
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:11,000
If you had a little more talk, you could have said,

341
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Let's say, let's go through the eyeballs.

342
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
First of all, you'll be told that in an interview.

343
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Are you a person who can go through?

344
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Go through?

345
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I can't go through.

346
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
First of all, give me a pencil.

347
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
What are you writing?

348
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Q.

349
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Is it written?

350
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Q.

351
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Can you go through the eyes?

352
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Q.

353
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Can you go through?

354
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Q.

355
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Can't you go through?

356
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Q.

357
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,000
If you write that you can go through, do you go through the right or the left?

358
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I go through the right.

359
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Ah, the right.

360
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Left.

361
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Left.

362
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Go through.

363
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Left.

364
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Then you can come from tomorrow.

365
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Wait a minute.

366
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
What?

367
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
What do you do when you go through the left eye?

368
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I go through the left eye.

369
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
That's the right eye.

370
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:10,000
No, I go through the right eye first and then the left eye.

371
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Sorry, I didn't know.

372
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Go through the left eye.

373
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Shut up!

374
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
What are you doing?

375
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
First of all, throw it.

376
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
First of all, you have to press the time card.

377
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Don't press it.

378
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
What kind of part-time job is that?

379
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Well, I'll tell you.

380
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:32,000
If you don't put the time card in before you go through the left eye, you won't understand unless you go through the left eye.

381
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I know that.

382
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
I'm sure those who go through the left eye will know that.

383
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Be careful.

384
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I put a poster on the top of the time card.

385
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
I'll go through the left eye after I do this.

386
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:51,000
I'll say, I'm in Matsumoto.

387
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Then I'll throw it hard.

388
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:01,000
I have a meter to measure, so I'll have you measure how many meters I've thrown.

389
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I can throw 15 meters.

390
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
If it's long, you can throw it as much as you want.

391
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Well, my eyes are quite attached to it.

392
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,000
From the morning to about 5 o'clock in the evening.

393
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:34,000
To put it simply, it's a repetition of that.

394
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Why do you have 86,000 frames?

395
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
That's why you're a bad guy.

396
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
There's a mirror.

397
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
This is a magic mirror.

398
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:54,000
There's a rich man eating while looking at the mirror.

399
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
He's throwing again.

400
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
I'm starting to understand.

401
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Well, how he throws.

402
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:11,000
The other day, Matsumoto-san was ranked second in the ranking of the best adults in Japan selected by elementary school students.

403
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Is that true?

404
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
I have a question for Matsumoto-san.

405
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
When do you think it was good to be an adult?

406
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Well, when I see myself standing naked like this.

407
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:31,000
After all, this is the behavior of an adult.

408
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
After all, this is an adult.

409
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:39,000
I'll definitely catch it.

410
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Don't do it again next year.

411
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,000
What are you talking about?

412
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
I'm sorry.

413
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
What is it?

414
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
I'll ask you instead.

415
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
What is it?

416
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
What is it?

417
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,000
You don't have to look at the behavior of an adult.

418
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
You can do it next year.

419
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Why are you doing this?

420
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
It's different.

421
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I don't know.

422
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:13,000
You and I are in the same team, aren't we?

423
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
What?

424
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:19,000
You're an adult, aren't you?

425
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,000
You may be an adult, but listen to this story.

426
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
We are a team, Matsumoto.

427
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
We are a pair.

428
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:34,000
We are a pair, and we are also a pair.

429
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
I said too much just now.

430
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
That's not true.

431
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
It's a pair.

432
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:47,000
As Matsumoto, this guy is doing his best.

433
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,000
He's doing his best.

434
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:56,000
He's doing his best.

435
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:01,000
You can't do it if you don't do it.

436
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
It's still funny.

437
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
You can't do it if you don't do it.

438
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:10,000
I'm happy about that.

439
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
I'm happy about that feeling.

440
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Everyone is happy about it.

441
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
We're all the same.

442
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
People say that everyone is alone.

443
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
No matter how many partners you have, you're always alone.

444
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
But this guy...

445
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Even if I go to the end of the world, this guy will come to me.

446
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:42,000
He's always there.

447
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
What do you think?

448
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
What do you think about this?

449
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:56,000
What do you think about this?
