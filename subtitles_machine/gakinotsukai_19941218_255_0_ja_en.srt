1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
This is the 5th year anniversary showdown between Kouhaku and Katsunen

2
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
In the past, we've had 12 showsdowns

3
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
That many?

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
This is the 5th showdown between Kouhaku and Katsunen

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
So you've been doing this for 5 years?

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Yes

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
No matter what channel you watch, it's all about showdowns

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
We've been doing this for a long time

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
It's like this

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:58,000
If you lose, you have to wear underwear

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
That's what our producer Sugaka says

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The 5th showdown between Kouhaku and Katsunen

13
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
This show is brought to you by these sponsors

14
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
We've done this 4 times in Kouhaku

15
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Yes

16
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
White or white

17
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
This is strange

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I've lost all of them

19
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
You've actually lost

20
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
This reminds me of something

21
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The flow is fast

22
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I am

23
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I am

24
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I am

25
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Am I stupid?

26
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Am I stupid?

27
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
It was popular

28
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
This is what happened in the past

29
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
This is the members of this year's show

30
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Matsumoto-san

31
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Let's look at the red team

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
What should I do?

33
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
You're a man

34
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
You're really persistent

35
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
You have to check before the show

36
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
You're wrong

37
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
You're a man

38
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
You made a mistake again

39
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
That's not what I meant

40
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
It's this

41
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Please take care of me

42
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
This brother again

43
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
How many times do I have to tell you?

44
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
What about TRF?

45
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I don't know TRF and Ryoko

46
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
What about Matsuda Seiko?

47
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I don't know

48
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I'll do that

49
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I think the red team is weak

50
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Is the man stronger?

51
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Do you know the story of Go Hiromi?

52
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Koudashin

53
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
The back of the father

54
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I know the back of the father

55
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I don't know the song

56
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Let's listen

57
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
My son

58
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
He's talking

59
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
He's talking

60
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Sabu-chan can sing anything

61
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
TOKIO

62
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
What is this?

63
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I don't know

64
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Let's listen to TOKIO

65
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
You have to go out

66
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I can't think of this

67
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Only you

68
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
That was good

69
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I have a plan

70
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Shirofumi Tori

71
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Yajirobe

72
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I think

73
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:07,000
If it's like this, it's better to include Geisha Girls

74
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I don't know

75
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
It's your turn

76
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
This year is especially difficult

77
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Difficult

78
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I don't know

79
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Let's listen to your opinion

80
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Why do you always ask me?

81
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Let's listen to your opinion

82
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Which one?

83
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Me?

84
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I'm Shiro

85
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I'm Shiro too

86
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
No

87
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
This is Shiro

88
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
There are too many people who don't know

89
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Even if you say Shiro, you don't know the song

90
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Everyone knows

91
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
It can't be helped

92
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Let's decide something simple

93
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
A game?

94
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Let's decide

95
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I prepared something

96
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I remember Badminton for 24 hours

97
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
It's a little blue

98
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Anything is fine

99
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
What should we do?

100
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Let's do Kero Kero Pick

101
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Okay

102
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
It's easy

103
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Really?

104
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Let's do this

105
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Let's do this

106
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
This?

107
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
What is that?

108
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
You have to put the ball in

109
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
How many times?

110
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Once?

111
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
The first three times

112
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Let's do that

113
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I'll go first

114
00:06:46,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I'll go first

115
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
You're good

116
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:25,000
You're good

117
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:39,000
You're good

118
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:48,000
You're good

119
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
This

120
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Stop it

121
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
It's weird

122
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
No

123
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
It's weird

124
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
It's weird

125
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
There were two

126
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I know

127
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I know

128
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
It's weird

129
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Let's do this

130
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Okay

131
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
You can do this

132
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
You do that

133
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Wait

134
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
What are you going to do with this?

135
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Even if you jump

136
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
If you do this

137
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
The person who threw the ball has to shoot

138
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
That's right

139
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
If you miss, it's over

140
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Okay

141
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I'm getting nervous

142
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Let's do this

143
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I don't have to do this

144
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
If you do it, it's over

145
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
That's right

146
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
He's not in the mood

147
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I told you to shoot

148
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
You're going to shoot

149
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I can't do this

150
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,000
You have to do it

151
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Wait

152
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I have to shoot

153
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I'm scared

154
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
It's here

155
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:48,000
It's definitely here

156
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Why

157
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
It's here

158
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
It's definitely going to come next time

159
00:09:52,000 --> 00:10:09,000
It's here

160
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Thank you

161
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
But I'm really bad at games

162
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Why

163
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I don't know

164
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I don't know if it's red or not

165
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I tried to shoot

166
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I don't know if I'm stupid

167
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Then you should go home

168
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
But I really don't know

169
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
That game is weird

170
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I've been thinking about it for 30 minutes

171
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
It's weird

172
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
You said it

173
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
It's better to float

174
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
You can shoot

175
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
But if I suddenly get shot, I won't be shot back

176
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:16,000
The moment you came out, I was like

177
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I was scared

178
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I won't be shot back

179
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I really want to avoid it this year

180
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Who's going to decide?

181
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
The judge?

182
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
And the phone?

183
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
The phone?

184
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
The phone?

185
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
The judge?

186
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
The one in the front

187
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
No, the one in the audience

188
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,000
The one in the audience

189
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I can't control it

190
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I'm going to ask the audience

191
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I'm going to ask the audience

192
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Why are you asking the audience

193
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I'm going to ask the audience

194
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I'm not happy if you ask the audience

195
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Do you know the person in the audience?

196
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I don't know

197
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I'm going to eat this

198
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
But

199
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
You saw the results

200
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
He's wearing white

201
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:12,000
It's hard to wear white

202
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
NHK is controlling it

203
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
They might say it's not good this year

204
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
It's possible

205
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
But it's not good to wear a Takuro Yoshida

206
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
It's not good to wear a Takuro Yoshida

207
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I'll dress up as Takuro Yoshida

208
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:30,000
But you can tell by your nose

209
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
No

210
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
What do you mean by your nose?

211
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I don't know

212
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I'm angry

213
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
What?

214
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
It's not good

215
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
What's not good?

216
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Even when I decide

217
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I don't know Matsumoto

218
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I don't know Matsumoto

219
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Why did you say it twice?

220
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I'm emphasizing it

221
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
They are all

222
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Matsumoto, you should lose

223
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:06,000
The atmosphere is like at home

224
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Matsumoto knows it

225
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Matsumoto doesn't know it

226
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
That's annoying

227
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
What should I do?

228
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Why did you say it once?

229
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
It's really annoying

230
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I don't know

231
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I'm really weak

232
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I don't know

233
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
The song is different

234
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I did the billiards with Machi

235
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I'm really weak

236
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I'm really really good

237
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
You can't show your strength in the actual performance

238
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
It's amazing

239
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
It's amazing

240
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
You're making excuses

241
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
It's not good

242
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
You can't show your strength in the actual performance

243
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
That's why

244
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
You can't show your strength in the actual performance

245
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
You can't show your strength in the actual performance

246
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I heard that you were really weak

247
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I can't show my strength in the actual performance

248
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
But I don't make excuses

249
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I don't have any skills

250
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
You're going to do the billiards for the special

251
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I'm going to do it tomorrow

252
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I did it for the special too

253
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I did it with Tanaka Misako

254
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
You did it because you wanted to kiss Tanaka Misako?

255
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
If it wasn't for that, I wouldn't have done it

256
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I didn't kiss her

257
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I don't know if you have bad breath

258
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Really?

259
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I'm not saying that it stinks

260
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I've never talked at this distance

261
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
It happens sometimes

262
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Right?

263
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Who was it?

264
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
It was an actress who was said to be pretty

265
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Did it stink?

266
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,000
It was really really bad

267
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Who was it?

268
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
It was a yakuza

269
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
There was a monster living in my mouth

270
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
There was a yakuza

271
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
There was an office

272
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
There was a yakuza

273
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I was surprised

274
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
When I was talking, a young lady came out

275
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:32,000
A young lady?

276
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Wait a minute

277
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
This is

278
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Happen

279
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Happen

280
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I was surprised

281
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I'm glad I was human

282
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,000
If I was a dog, I'd be like

283
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I have to promote the opening next week

284
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
My super car

285
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
What super car?

286
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Camaro

287
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Camaro

288
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
It's matte black

289
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
It's like a super model

290
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
This is the only car in the world

291
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I see

292
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I decided to sell this

293
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I'm not selling it

294
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,000
If there's anyone who wants this

295
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Next week

296
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
The location hasn't been decided yet

297
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
It'll be on air

298
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Please come

299
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Bring something

300
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:51,000
If you don't decide

301
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Something worth 100,000 yen

302
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
For example, someone bought this for 100,000 yen

303
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
That's fine

304
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Or a photo of my room

305
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
100,000 yen

306
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,000
If you think it's worth 100,000 yen

307
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
If it's just standing

308
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
What?

309
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Of course you have to get it with a polaroid

310
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
That's right

311
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
You can dress up

312
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
But you can't show it

313
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Why?

314
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
It's my Camaro

315
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Let's go downtown together

316
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Wait a minute

317
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I'm the judge

318
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
That's all

319
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Anything is fine

320
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
It's 100,000 yen

321
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Of course you can buy something

322
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Something expensive

323
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
But it's fine

324
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
If you're over 18

325
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
If you have a license

326
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
If you don't have a license

327
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
You have to give it to someone

328
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
This is from me

329
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
It'll be on air on the 25th

330
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
It's a Christmas present

331
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
That's great

332
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Let's take it home

333
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
It'll be fine

334
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
It's so warm

335
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
What is this warmth?

336
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
This

337
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
It's so warm

338
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
It's so warm

339
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
It's from me

340
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
What about you?

341
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
What?

342
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
What?

343
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
What is it?

344
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Camaro

345
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
That's great

346
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
It's a Christmas present

347
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
What is this?

348
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
What?

349
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
What is that?

350
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I won't show it

351
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
What about you?

352
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
What will you show?

353
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Why?

354
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
What do you want me to show?

355
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,000
The pistol you put in your bag

356
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Do you really think that?

357
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Do you really think that I put it in my bag?

358
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
It's possible

359
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Is it possible?

360
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
It's fine

361
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
It's your Christmas present

362
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,000
You're amazing

363
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:44,000
I don't need a new car

364
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I have a new car

365
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
I have money

366
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
That's not a car

367
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,000
That's my cousin's dad

368
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
My cousin's dad looks like this

369
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:04,000
It's shining

370
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I'll put a magic on a witch

371
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
That's not a bad idea

372
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I'll think about it next year

373
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,000
What is the most expensive thing in your house?

374
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,000
The most expensive thing?

375
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
It's my car

376
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
How much is it?

377
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
It's not that expensive

378
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
No

379
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
I won't tell you

380
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
I won't tell you

381
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I won't tell you

382
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
I won't tell you

383
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
I won't tell you

384
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
I won't tell you

385
00:20:49,000 --> 00:21:01,000
I won't tell you

386
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I want to join

387
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Sure

388
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Bring the car I'm in

389
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
I'll lose my legs

390
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
It's cool

391
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
The car I'm in

392
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:27,000
I'll pull it

393
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:32,000
I'm not pulling it

394
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
I'm not pulling it

395
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I'll pull a dog and a cat

396
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I won't pull it

397
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I have to do it once in a while

398
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I'll do it

399
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Who are you cheering for?

400
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
A dog and a cat

401
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
If you kill it, it's over

402
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
I'm not killing it

403
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Even if I pull it, it won't move

404
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,000
It's going to bite me

405
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:07,000
It's going to bite me

406
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
In the morning, a bird

407
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
When I get off the car, a deer is waiting

408
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
It's waiting around here

409
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
And it's like this

410
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Okay, okay

411
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,000
In the UK, they have a violin

412
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
It's a human trait

413
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Sometimes it goes like this

414
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:42,000
I have to show my stubborn father

415
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Matsumoto is saying a lot of things

416
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
What did you say?

417
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I said a lot

418
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
What did you say?

419
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,000
It's not like that

420
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
It's not like that

421
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
What did you say?

422
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
I said I don't have enough rice

423
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
You can't say that

424
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:13,000
I said I don't have enough rice next year

425
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
What is that?

426
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Let's take a look

427
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
What is that?

428
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Let's take a look

429
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,000
What is that?

430
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I don't have enough rice

431
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I don't have enough water

432
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:33,000
I don't have enough glasses next year

433
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
This is interesting

434
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
I don't have enough glasses

435
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
There are a lot of glasses in the shop

436
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,000
They all disappeared

437
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:52,000
All the couples who are on the road

438
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:58,000
I'm looking for it because it fell

439
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Why are you walking around there?

440
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
