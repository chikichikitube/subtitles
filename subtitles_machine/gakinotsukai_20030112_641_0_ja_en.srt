1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,160
No.3

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I didn't see that coming.

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Happy New Year.

4
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Today we have a special project for the new year.

5
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
We will give you the best VTR of 2002.

6
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
This year, we have chosen the former downtown manager,

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
the current producer of Lumineda Yoshimoto,

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Hiroshi Fujiwara.

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I will call him by his first name.

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Nice to meet you.

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
You have nothing to do with this program.

12
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Why do you only do this?

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Thank you.

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Thank you.

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Really, please.

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Thank you.

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
How was last year?

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
You watched it, right?

19
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Yes, I watched it.

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
You were active.

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Except for Yama-chan.

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Wait a minute.

23
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
You watched it, right?

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Yes, I watched it.

25
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
And Yamazaki-san too.

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Is that so?

27
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
This program is brought to you by these sponsors.

28
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
First of all, the best VTR of 2002.

29
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
From 10th to 7th place.

30
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:04,000
VTR Kuru-Kuru-Kuru.

31
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
It's strange that Azarashi is in the center.

32
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Don't call him Azarashi.

33
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
It's Tama-chan.

34
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
That's no good.

35
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Based on the information we received,

36
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
we went to see Tama-chan, who caused a big fever this summer.

37
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Come here.

38
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Who?

39
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
It's Tama-chan.

40
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Look, look.

41
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
It's Tama-chan.

42
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
It's Tama-chan.

43
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
It's not.

44
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
It's Tama-chan.

45
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
It's Tama-chan.

46
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Shut up.

47
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
One, two.

48
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Tama-chan.

49
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
It's embarrassing.

50
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Let's go home.

51
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Let's go home.

52
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
That's good.

53
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Let's go home.

54
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
What's wrong?

55
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
What's this?

56
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
It's Tama-chan.

57
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
It's Tama-chan.

58
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
It's Pride Day.

59
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
It's Pride Day.

60
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I'll do it like a role-playing.

61
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
One, two.

62
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Tama-chan.

63
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
It's Tama-chan.

64
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
It's amazing.

65
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
It's good that we saw a lot.

66
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Hey.

67
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
What's wrong?

68
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Hey.

69
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
What?

70
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Hey.

71
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
What?

72
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
One, two.

73
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Tama-chan.

74
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
It's looking.

75
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
It's looking.

76
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
It's looking.

77
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
It's looking.

78
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
It's looking.

79
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
It's looking that way.

80
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:39,000
In order to get rid of his daily work, Chidou came to Odaiba with the help of Producer Suga.

81
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,000
For some reason, this project has become a battle between ordinary people and menchi.

82
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
It's not working at all.

83
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I've never cut menchi before.

84
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
It's not working at all.

85
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I'm sorry.

86
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I'm sorry.

87
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Hey, Miko-san.

88
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
What are you doing?

89
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I'm sorry.

90
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I'm sorry.

91
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
What are you doing?

92
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I'm sorry.

93
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
You're a friend, aren't you?

94
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
It's a good idea.

95
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
It's a good idea.

96
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I was really scared.

97
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Let's see the car.

98
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Is it there?

99
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Yes.

100
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Let's see.

101
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
This is...

102
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
This is impossible.

103
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
This is...

104
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Hey, give me a break.

105
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,000
You're a friend, aren't you?

106
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Even though you're big.

107
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
The annual big event, the entertainment fishing competition.

108
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
This time, the first time that Asano Torobu has participated.

109
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
The gorgeous Kaobure has gathered in Kaguchiko and has had a hot fishing battle.

110
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I'm so sad.

111
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
So the winner is...

112
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
The winner is...

113
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I see.

114
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Matsumoto, who lost in the Japanese series, is throwing the pie.

115
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
But Matsumoto doesn't react at all.

116
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
No reaction pie hell.

117
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
It's time for the big one.

118
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
It's hard, isn't it?

119
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I'm going to throw up.

120
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
He dropped the towel.

121
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Wait a minute.

122
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I'm going to die.

123
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
The 7th place is like this.

124
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
This is the most recent punishment game.

125
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
This is...

126
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I've been told many times.

127
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
You've been told.

128
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
That it's hard.

129
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I want to have a match with someone else and do it.

130
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
This is the most popular punishment game.

131
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Yes, we did it.

132
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
It's the first time that Aroha-chan did it.

133
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
It's your debut, isn't it?

134
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Yes, it's my debut.

135
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I said I was going to do it twice, but I'm going to do it once.

136
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
The opponent is...

137
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Who is it?

138
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Kijime Shiro.

139
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Thank you.

140
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Thank you.

141
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,000
You dropped it.

142
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Why did you drop it?

143
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I don't know.

144
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Kijime Shiro, the guest, suddenly fell into a pitfall.

145
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
The man-to-man cooking battle started unexpectedly.

146
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I can't do it today.

147
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I don't think you should say that.

148
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Do you know what I was doing?

149
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I don't know.

150
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I'll sell more money.

151
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I don't want to do it.

152
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Kijime, who was completely upset by this incident, went home.

153
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
However, Ichidou managed to persuade Kijime to continue recording.

154
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
The first episode of Gaginotsukai Yaraen.

155
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,000
The man-to-man cooking battle in the entertainment world.

156
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
The second episode of Gaginotsukai Yaraen.

157
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Today's guest is Kijime Shiro.

158
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
This is a cooking battle.

159
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Let's start.

160
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I'm sorry.

161
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I'm sorry.

162
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
What do you mean you're sorry?

163
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I only have money.

164
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Thank you.

165
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Thank you.

166
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Thank you.

167
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Ouch.

168
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
What is it?

169
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I can't move.

170
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Yamasaki, who is expected to record suddenly.

171
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Then, Suga.

172
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Wait a minute.

173
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Let's go.

174
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Yamasaki.

175
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Yamasaki, wait a minute.

176
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Yamasaki, wait a minute.

177
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Yamasaki.

178
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I'm sorry.

179
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I can't take a picture.

180
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I'm sorry.

181
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I did it.

182
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Right after this, Hamada and Tanaka are down.

183
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Hamada.

184
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Hamada.

185
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Well.

186
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Well.

187
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I'm sorry.

188
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I'm sorry.

189
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I'm sorry.

190
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I'm sorry.

191
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
What happened?

192
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Match.

193
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Match?

194
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Yes.

195
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Let's cooking.

196
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Somehow, the members who came back to the studio immediately started the cooking battle.

197
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
But here, Endo.

198
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Ouch.

199
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
What's wrong, Endo?

200
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Are you okay, Endo?

201
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Suga.

202
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Are you okay, Endo?

203
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Yes.

204
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I'm sorry.

205
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
How about Endo?

206
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Are you okay?

207
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I'm sorry.

208
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Are you feeling down?

209
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
What?

210
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Are you feeling down?

211
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I'm feeling down.

212
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I need to cheer up.

213
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Endo, what's wrong?

214
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Do you want to put your finger in?

215
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I don't have enough time.

216
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:47,000
And after this, Matsumoto is also down.

217
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Ah.

218
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Ah.

219
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Ah.

220
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Are you okay?

221
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Are you okay?

222
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I'm worried.

223
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Are you okay?

224
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I'm worried.

225
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I'll do my best.

226
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
OSU! Ikidomebu is aiming to be the number one in the entertainment industry.

227
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,000
The first opponent is the strong opponent, the team from the north of OSU.

228
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
First, Hamada appears.

229
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
The opponent is Taka Gadarukana.

230
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
The 50-second wall.

231
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
The 50-second wall.

232
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
One minute left.

233
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Wow.

234
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I wanted to go for one minute.

235
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Ready.

236
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Start.

237
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I'm counting on you.

238
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Okay, it's done.

239
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
45 seconds.

240
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Okay.

241
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Okay, it's done.

242
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
It's really amazing.

243
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
It's just a half-cut.

244
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
And finally, it's the final battle.

245
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Matsumoto is going for the victory.

246
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Start.

247
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Okay.

248
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Don't use the oil.

249
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Don't use the oil.

250
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
It's okay.

251
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Don't use the oil.

252
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Don't use the oil.

253
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
You're coming back.

254
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
You're coming back.

255
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
It's done.

256
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
30 seconds.

257
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Wow.

258
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Ready.

259
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Start.

260
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
He's being cornered.

261
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Okay.

262
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
He looks like a bad guy.

263
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Why are you doing that?

264
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
30 seconds have passed.

265
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
He's coming back.

266
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
He's coming back.

267
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Yama-chan is coming back.

268
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Look.

269
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
He's coming back.

270
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
He's coming back.

271
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Wait.

272
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Wait.

273
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Wait.

274
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Wait.

275
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Wait.

276
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Wait.

277
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Wait.

278
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Wait.

279
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
So close.

280
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
So close.

281
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
So close.

282
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Only 5 seconds left.

283
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
So close.

284
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Only 5 seconds left.

285
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Only 5 seconds left.

286
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
This is the last round.

287
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
The first round.

288
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
How many times have you done this?

289
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
How many times have you done this?

290
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Only 2 times.

291
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Only 2 times.

292
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
But you haven't done it once.

293
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
No.

294
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
No.

295
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
That's right.

296
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
9 seconds is terrible.

297
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
It's terrible.

298
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Really?

299
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Yes.

300
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
That's not good.

301
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
If you say it like that, we can't say anything.

302
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
What should we do?

303
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
It's scary.

304
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
You don't have a lot of life force.

305
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Matsumoto lost to the Hamada team in a race.

306
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
The 5 members of the family will make an interview.

307
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
The action show will be broadcast live for 5 minutes in the morning.

308
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Are you okay?

309
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Matsumoto family is having fun with the family for the first time in a long time.

310
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Are you okay?

311
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
It's just 2 legs.

312
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
It's just 2 legs.

313
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
But the fried chicken is delicious.

314
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
You put a lot of salmon in the rice.

315
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
It's strange.

316
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I didn't put rice in it.

317
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
It's strange.

318
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I didn't put rice in it.

319
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I didn't put rice in it.

320
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Have you ever put chicken in it?

321
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
The fried chicken is delicious.

322
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Why didn't you sell it?

323
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I haven't eaten it for 10 years.

324
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
The fried chicken is delicious.

325
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
The fried chicken is delicious.

326
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
And finally the real show.

327
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I'm waiting for my dad.

328
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I thought it was about time.

329
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Someone help me.

330
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Help me.

331
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Help me.

332
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Help me.

333
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I don't know anyone.

334
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I don't know anyone.

335
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I don't know anyone.

336
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I don't know anyone.

337
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I don't know anyone.

338
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I don't know anyone.

339
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I don't know anyone.

340
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I don't know anyone.

341
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I don't know anyone.

342
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I'm going to faint from here.

343
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I'm going to faint from here.

344
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
What is this?

345
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
This is a broadcast.

346
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
What is this?

347
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I didn't see it.

348
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I don't remember the sound.

349
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I don't remember the sound.

350
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
It's nice to have a family.

351
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Everyone, take care of your family.

352
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Bye bye.

353
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I don't remember anyone.

354
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I don't remember anyone.

355
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
It's a commercial.

356
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I'm number two.

357
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I'm number two.

358
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:24,000
One day, the person who was called by Yamazaki stepped into the mystery world.

359
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Are you still using Korn?

360
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:38,000
That's why I gave you a chance to use Korn.

361
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,000
In this mystery world, the 16th century is France.

362
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:49,000
There are four gold coins.

363
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:56,000
If you can find it, I'll give you a great treasure.

364
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
This is how the treasure hunt began.

365
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,000
But after this, Yamazaki World was waiting.

366
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Everyone, did you understand?

367
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I've been working for Gilbert for 25 years.

368
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
My name is Audrey.

369
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I work for Gilbert.

370
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Because Gilbert is cool.

371
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Your adventure will continue.

372
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Yamazaki wants the four of them to go to the haunted house.

373
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Hamada and Endo will enter the house.

374
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I'm scared.

375
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I'm scared.

376
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I'm scared.

377
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I'm scared.

378
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I'm scared.

379
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
I'm scared.

380
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Let's go together.

381
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Why?

382
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I don't want to.

383
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Shut up.

384
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I'm scared.

385
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I don't want to.

386
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Shut up.

387
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:30,000
And as if they finally reached the goal, they found the wonderful treasure.

388
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I'm scared.

389
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I'm scared.

390
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Everyone, let's go.

391
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
1, 2, 3.

392
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
It's a waste.

393
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
It's really a waste.

394
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
It's going up.

395
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
It's going up.

396
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
It's over.

397
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
It's coming out.

398
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Hello.

399
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
This is what Yamazaki wanted to do.

400
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
This is 2.

401
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
This is 2.

402
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
This is...

403
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
This is 2.

404
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
This is...

405
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
This is not what I wanted.

406
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
I think Komu put it in.

407
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Komu really likes Yamazaki.

408
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
When he was doing that, he kept laughing.

409
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
He likes it.

410
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
It's terrible.

411
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
It's terrible.

412
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
It's so noisy.

413
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
He panicked.

414
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
I don't know why it's open on Wednesdays.

415
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I don't know why it's open on Wednesdays.

416
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
I don't know why it's open on Wednesdays.

417
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Hello.

418
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Hello.

419
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
This is a popular snack in Japan.

420
00:21:33,000 --> 00:22:00,000
This is a popular snack in Japan.

421
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:30,000
This is a popular snack in Japan.

422
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Are you okay?

423
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
You drank too much.

424
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Why is this my friend?

425
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Sit down.

426
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
I can't stand it.

427
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
I can't stand it.

428
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:06,000
I can't stand it.

429
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
I can't stand it.

430
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
I can't stand it.

431
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Sit down.

432
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Sit down.

433
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Wait a little.

434
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Wait.

435
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Amazing.

436
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
He can't help it.

437
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
He can't help it.

438
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
He can't win.

439
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
He can't win.

440
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Do you have more?

441
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
He's good.

442
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
He's doing it until the end.

443
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
This is the first time in four years.

444
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
That's right.

445
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
It's the 10th place.

446
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:07,000
I hope you will do your best this year.

447
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
I want to see Yamada.

448
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Yamada, what do you think?

449
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
This is Yamada.

450
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:22,000
This program is provided by the sponsor you see.
