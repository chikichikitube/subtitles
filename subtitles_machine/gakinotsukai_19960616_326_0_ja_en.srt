1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
What kind of comedy is this?

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I don't know.

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Well, it has started today as well.

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I thought I would get 100,000 yen today.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I went to Nagabuchi Tsuyoshi's concert.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
After the concert, he asked me to come to his dressing room.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
He said, you are amazing.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Normally, after the concert, the staff would be busy, right?

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I would write a letter and say, thank you for today.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I imagined it in my head.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I really liked Higashino and Kurano.

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
They invited me to their dressing room.

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I said, this way, please.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I was really surprised.

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I was sitting alone in this big room.

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I was sitting alone in this big room.

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I thought I was going to get beaten up.

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I was waiting for the staff to come.

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I was sitting alone in this big room.

20
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I was sitting alone in this big room.

21
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I said, this is a family.

22
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I have been doing this for longer than usual.

23
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I said, this is a family service.

24
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I have been doing this for longer than usual.

25
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
They came to me.

26
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Higashino is always like that.

27
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I was surprised when I went to them.

28
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I was surprised when I went to them.

29
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I was surprised when I went to them.

30
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I was surprised when I went to them.

31
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
When I reached out to them, they hugged me.

32
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I wanted to drink coffee on my own will.

33
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
They said, I'll wait for you in Kurano.

34
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
They drank coffee with the three of them.

35
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
They were really cool.

36
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Who is the real guy?

37
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Shall we?

38
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Let's go for a red light.

39
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I have a question for Matsumoto-san, the killer.

40
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
What is Matsumoto-san's killing technique?

41
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
And what is Nakama doing now? Please tell me.

42
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Umm...

43
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
It's not really a killing technique.

44
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
If you think about it, anything can become a weapon.

45
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Anything can kill people.

46
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
For example, a washing machine can kill people.

47
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
It's not a killing technique.

48
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
When you want to get rid of the water, you have to get closer to the machine.

49
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Like this.

50
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
It's an old washing machine.

51
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
It can kill people.

52
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
It can kill people.

53
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
You don't have to think about it.

54
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
You can just grab it and kill people.

55
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
You can just grab it and kill people.

56
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
It can kill people.

57
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
That's embarrassing.

58
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
What is?

59
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
That's embarrassing.

60
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
What is?

61
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
It's obvious that you can kill people.

62
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
You can laugh at it.

63
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I can laugh at it too.

64
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I won't get killed.

65
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Oh my.

66
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I'm surprised.

67
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I'm surprised too.

68
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
It can kill 6 people.

69
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I won't get killed.

70
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Do you have friends?

71
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I have friends.

72
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Can you tell me what you are doing now?

73
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Why do I have to tell you?

74
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I have a job, so please contact me.

75
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
You can contact me.

76
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
How many people do you have?

77
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Two people.

78
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
That's a lot.

79
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
What are the other two people doing?

80
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
One is at the soap factory.

81
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
How about the other one?

82
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
The other one is at the highway.

83
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
How about the one at the cashier?

84
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
It's an old man.

85
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I don't care.

86
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000
You're a great trio.

87
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
You have a sister and an old man.

88
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
That's right.

89
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
That's the most suspicious.

90
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
If you say it on TV, the three of us have to walk like this.

91
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
That's right.

92
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Old man and sister.

93
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
How are you going to kill them?

94
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Old men usually aim at the highway.

95
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
That's a long story.

96
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
It's a long story.

97
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
The old man opens the door and says,

98
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I'll give you 600 yen.

99
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
600 yen.

100
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
700 yen.

101
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
700 yen.

102
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
He pulls me.

103
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
He pulls me.

104
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
He pulls me.

105
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
He pulls me.

106
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
He pulls me.

107
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
He pulls me.

108
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
He pulls me.

109
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Stop that.

110
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
You old man.

111
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
The old man cuts into your heart.

112
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
That's right.

113
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

114
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
700 yen.

115
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
700 yen.

116
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Kendi Gyakodon.

117
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Kendi Gyakodon.

118
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,000
You can do it!

119
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Old man!

120
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
But if it doesn't do that much damage...

121
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Well, it's fine. I don't mind.

122
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
It's just soap.

123
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
It's not even something to use.

124
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
It's just soap.

125
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I just do this, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap.

126
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Then roll it up,

127
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
then it comes,

128
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
and it's crumpled!

129
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
It's crumpled!

130
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,000
What the hell are you doing?

131
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
What's with the crumpling?

132
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
This is strangely interesting.

133
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
So even if the manuscript is stolen, it's not a big deal.

134
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Mr. Gozo, I have a cat, but there are times when I don't know where it is.

135
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Please tell me where it is.

136
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I think he can say that he is from Todai.

137
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Oh, I see.

138
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:51,000
For example, looking for glasses, looking for glasses while wearing glasses here.

139
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
But first of all, I think it's the same as that.

140
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Do you think it won't break?

141
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Yes, I do.

142
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Nearby?

143
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Yes.

144
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Where is it?

145
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
No, it's on the back.

146
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I don't know if it's here like the glasses.

147
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,000
You can tell by the weight if it's on the back.

148
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Yesterday, when I was watching the video, a fly was flying.

149
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I was worried about it while watching it.

150
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I turned on the light with a moa gun and looked at it from the side.

151
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I thought I wanted to go to Nagabuchi.

152
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,000
When I turned on the light, the fly disappeared.

153
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I looked for it, but it wasn't there.

154
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,000
First of all, I thought it was somewhere in my house.

155
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Did you get drunk?

156
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
What?

157
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
No, I didn't get drunk.

158
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I looked at the picture and watched the video again, but the fly didn't come out.

159
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
That means...

160
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I was right.

161
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Why?

162
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
No, no, no.

163
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I was right.

164
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
No, you weren't.

165
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I was right.

166
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
You didn't feel anything, did you?

167
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
No, I didn't feel anything.

168
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
You did feel something.

169
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
What was it?

170
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Something like a thud.

171
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
That's a fly in the stomach, isn't it?

172
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
It's screaming.

173
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
It's screaming at the glass.

174
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I don't know why.

175
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I don't know either.

176
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
There's a fly that can't be cleaned.

177
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.

178
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
The one that was in the glass?

179
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
When Masumoto-san was in Takarazuka,

180
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
the president of the Japan Theatre Association told him that he had been killed.

181
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,000
He said, show me the pantomime where you catch a runaway bird.

182
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
He was in Takarazuka.

183
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
It doesn't matter.

184
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
He wasn't in Takarazuka.

185
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
What?

186
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
You're lying.

187
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
There's a lot of letters and you have to wait in one place.

188
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
That's right.

189
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,000
It's a pain in the ass, so don't do it.

190
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
The runaway bird.

191
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
What are you doing?

192
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
What are you doing?

193
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I'm starting.

194
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Do it.

195
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
The pantomime where you catch a runaway bird.

196
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Where did it run away?

197
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
That's something you have to think about.

198
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
You have to act it out yourself.

199
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
It's all over the place.

200
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:45,000
It's all over the place.

201
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Where are you?

202
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Hey.

203
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
You're drinking in such a small place.

204
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
On the top of the building.

205
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
On the top of the building?

206
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
On the top of the building.

207
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
There's glass here too.

208
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Do you understand?

209
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Yes.

210
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Let's assume there's glass here.

211
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Hey.

212
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
You can't talk.

213
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Say something better.

214
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Hey.

215
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Drink slowly later.

216
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Where are you now?

217
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
What is this?

218
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I just caught it.

219
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I just caught it.

220
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:04,000
This is a question for Matsumoto-san who has been married hundreds of times.

221
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
What's in your bride's hair?

222
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Do you know this?

223
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I know what's in it.

224
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Do you know what's in it?

225
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I'm just covering it.

226
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Why are you covering it?

227
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I'm matching it with my kimono.

228
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
You're matching it with your kimono.

229
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
You're saying you're matching it with your kimono.

230
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I'm saying it.

231
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Say it more specifically.

232
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
What's in it?

233
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
It's not in there.

234
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
You're covering it with your hair.

235
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Hey, hey, hey.

236
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Are you angry?

237
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
It's in there.

238
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
What's wrong with that?

239
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
That's not true.

240
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
It's in there, so it's like this.

241
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
It's not in there.

242
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:51,000
It's my kimono.

243
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I can't talk to you.

244
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Whatever.

245
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Tell me what's in it.

246
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Shall I tell you?

247
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:07,000
The memories of walking with your parents.

248
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:17,000
The memories of sitting with Matsumoto-san.

249
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
You're a relaxed person.

250
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
It's often said that Matsumoto-san was the one who decided on the 12th.

251
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Thank you very much.

252
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Thank you very much.

253
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
What was the standard for deciding?

254
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Please tell me.

255
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:37,000
In the end, it's a natural enemy.

256
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
A natural enemy?

257
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
It's a natural enemy.

258
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Thank you very much.

259
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Please tell me.

260
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Hey, I'll catch a mouse.

261
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
What does that mean?

262
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
A mouse.

263
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
A mouse.

264
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:57,000
A mouse is eating a mouse.

265
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Did you think you could get away with it?

266
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
That's mean.

267
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Why?

268
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:28,000
That's mean.
