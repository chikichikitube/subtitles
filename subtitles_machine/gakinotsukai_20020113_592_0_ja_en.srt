1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,000
It's already the end of the year.

2
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
What do you mean?

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
It's already the end of the year.

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Everyone knows that, right?

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Does anyone have a stomachache?

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:40,000
This program is brought to you by these sponsors.

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
It's been a while since we've met, right?

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Yes.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It's been a while since we've met, right?

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
It's been about four days.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:56,000
This is the first time I've said this, but I don't think I've done anything good this year.

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Why?

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I haven't done anything good.

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
It's only been a little while since it started.

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
It's been a while since we've met, right?

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
It's been a while since we've met, right?

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I moved to a new house.

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I moved to a new house.

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
What about the auction?

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I saw it.

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
It's a one-room apartment.

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
You're lying.

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
It's a one-room apartment.

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
It's a 7.5-story apartment.

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
It's a mid-sized apartment.

26
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
It's a mezzanine type apartment.

27
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
It's a woman.

28
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
It's a female student.

29
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
When I woke up, the ceiling hit me.

30
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I asked her if she wanted a pot.

31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
She said she was going to the eastern part.

32
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
She's alone.

33
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
She's alone, but she has two daughters.

34
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
They're playing with each other.

35
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
She said she'd give her to her wife in the new year.

36
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
She said she was going to the hot spring.

37
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
She said she was going to the hot spring.

38
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
She has two daughters.

39
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
The upper child is calm.

40
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
The lower child is still a little tired.

41
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
She has three or four children.

42
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
She's still a little tired.

43
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
She's still a little tired.

44
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
She's still a little tired.

45
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I had a bad feeling.

46
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Kim was drinking wine next to me.

47
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I put it on the carpet.

48
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Bang!

49
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
The red wine on the carpet that I had just moved.

50
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Bang!

51
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Please forgive me.

52
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I was in a bad mood.

53
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I was in a bad mood.

54
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I had to put it on the carpet because I had a child.

55
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I was angry.

56
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I saw the red wine on the carpet.

57
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I was angry.

58
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Why are you sad?

59
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I didn't think I would be angry.

60
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
It doesn't matter if you're angry.

61
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
It's what old people do.

62
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
It's okay.

63
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
It's okay if you know.

64
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
It's okay.

65
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I understand.

66
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I'm going to take care of the eastern part.

67
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Please apologize to the old man on the spot.

68
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Please apologize to the old man on the spot.

69
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
That doctor said,

70
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
It doesn't matter if you apologize.

71
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
It doesn't matter if you apologize.

72
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
It doesn't matter if you apologize.

73
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I don't understand why you don't want to apologize.

74
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Shut up.

75
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Shut up.

76
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
You don't want to apologize?

77
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Shut up.

78
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
It's a lie.

79
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
The next day, I was in Guam. I was really worried about the stain.

80
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Why? Don't do that to yourself.

81
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Yu came to me.

82
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
He told me to sprinkle salt on him.

83
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
He sprinkled salt on me.

84
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I was like, is this for real?

85
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Look at this! Look at this!

86
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
You were able to take it off, right?

87
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I used a vacuum cleaner and sprinkled salt on him.

88
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
The stain was clean.

89
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
It was clean.

90
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
After a few hours, I had to go to Narita.

91
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I was really worried.

92
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I was really worried about the stain.

93
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
No, that's not true.

94
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
It was like Gorbachev.

95
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
It's just a little stain.

96
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
It's not that big.

97
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
It's not that big.

98
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
That's all.

99
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
No, no, no. I went to Guam. I went to Guam. The weather was bad.

100
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Oh, really?

101
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
The weather was really bad. The people in Guam were surprised.

102
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
The weather was like this in the middle of the month.

103
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
It was raining all day.

104
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I had a cold.

105
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Oh, really?

106
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Guam has a cold, right?

107
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
But I was burning up.

108
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
The weather was good for about two days.

109
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
After about five days, the next three days were always raining.

110
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
It's the worst when you catch a cold in Guam.

111
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Ishida was also coming from Osaka.

112
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
He said, let's play.

113
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
He was playing ballet.

114
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I bought it.

115
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I bought it and said I could eat anything.

116
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,000
When I went to Chuka, my nose was stuffed and I couldn't taste it at all.

117
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
No, I'm full.

118
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
That's all.

119
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
You know my first dream?

120
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
No, I don't know.

121
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:35,000
It's the dream where Dondoko's Yamaguchi beat Hikuson.

122
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I don't understand the meaning.

123
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I'm watching it at the venue.

124
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I'm telling you to do your best.

125
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I don't understand the meaning.

126
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
But you're happy, aren't you?

127
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I'm happy, but I'm telling you.

128
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I'm telling you, but I can't.

129
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I can't say anything.

130
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Where have you been?

131
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I went to Kobe.

132
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Kobe?

133
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
What?

134
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I saved money again.

135
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Do you want so much money?

136
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
It doesn't matter if I go to Kobe.

137
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
It's okay to go to Kobe.

138
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Are you a movie star?

139
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I'm not.

140
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:29,000
It's a movie star.

141
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
It's not cool.

142
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I think it was on the screen.

143
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
It was on the screen.

144
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
It was on the screen.

145
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
It disappeared suddenly.

146
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I don't understand the meaning.

147
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I'm telling you to do your best.

148
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I'm telling you, but I can't say anything.

149
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
It was hard.

150
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Did you go to Kobe?

151
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I don't understand the meaning.

152
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I went to Universal Studios.

153
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Are you going to the movie theater?

154
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I'm going.

155
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Are you a movie star?

156
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Are you a movie star?

157
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I've been there before.

158
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I've been there.

159
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I've been there.

160
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I've been there.

161
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I've been there.

162
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I've been there.

163
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I was a bad guy when I was young.

164
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I was a bad guy when I was young.

165
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
What is a bad guy?

166
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
You have a family and children.

167
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I have a family and children.

168
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Children are stupid.

169
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I'm not stupid.

170
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Let's have him take it out.

171
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
He didn't say anything last year.

172
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I still don't know his name.

173
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
This is a question for Mr. Matsumoto, who especially likes hunting.

174
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:58,000
It seems that Yoshimoto Kogyo once led a group of comedians to hunt in the mountains. What were you looking for?

175
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Well, I've said this a few times before, but when I read this letter, the customer's appetite was this bad.

176
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I'm not interested.

177
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I can't tell people who aren't hungry that this food is delicious.

178
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I'm not interested.

179
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I don't think that's the case.

180
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Really?

181
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
That's because Yoshimoto...

182
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
He's a member of the board of directors of comedians.

183
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
He's a member of the board of directors of comedians.

184
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I see.

185
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Mr. Kiyoshi.

186
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
What?

187
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Mr. Kiyoshi.

188
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Yes, yes.

189
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Kibouga.

190
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Kibouga was looking for Helen.

191
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I didn't participate.

192
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
At that time.

193
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I went into the mountains and saw it.

194
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Kanoko saw it.

195
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Oh, this guy.

196
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I can't chase after Kanoko.

197
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
But I lost sight of Kanoko.

198
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I went into the mountains and saw it.

199
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Helen.

200
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Helen.

201
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
How many times did you say Helen?

202
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I'm sorry.

203
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I wasn't looking for it.

204
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
But I found it.

205
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Well, you found it, but it was dead.

206
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
It was dead.

207
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
It's okay.

208
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I won't fight you until the end.

209
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I won't fight you until the end.

210
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
It's okay.

211
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Is that so?

212
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
You've been dating a lot of comedians.

213
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Among them, you had the hardest time breaking up.

214
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Please show us a picture of you breaking up.

215
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Well, after all, I'm an old woman.

216
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Don't say that.

217
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
What?

218
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
You're married now, aren't you?

219
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
That's right.

220
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Before that?

221
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Before that.

222
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I was wearing a little bit of makeup.

223
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
You were wearing makeup?

224
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Yes.

225
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
You were wearing makeup, right?

226
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
That's right.

227
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
You're being beaten up.

228
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Well, that's right.

229
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Where did you end up?

230
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
What?

231
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I went to the library.

232
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Why did you go to the library?

233
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I don't know why I went to the library.

234
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Did you go to the library?

235
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I went to the library.

236
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
A woman came to the library.

237
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Why did you talk to her?

238
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
She came to me.

239
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I see.

240
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Why?

241
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
She said something amazing.

242
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Approach?

243
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Approach.

244
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
That's right.

245
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
That's right.

246
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
And then you dated her?

247
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Well, that's right.

248
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
That's right.

249
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I said I wanted to break up with her.

250
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
You did?

251
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Yes.

252
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
About two years ago.

253
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
You haven't dated her for two years?

254
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
You should have told me earlier.

255
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Yes.

256
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
But...

257
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
It was a one-time thing.

258
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
No matter what I said.

259
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
That's right.

260
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
It's a little funny.

261
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
That's right.

262
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
You said thank you at the end.

263
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
How did you end up breaking up with her?

264
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
What?

265
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
How did you end up breaking up with her?

266
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I had a hard time.

267
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I see.

268
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I had her buy me a lot of things.

269
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
You're so mean.

270
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
What are you talking about?

271
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
What?

272
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
You had a lot of things.

273
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
That's right.

274
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
You're so mean.

275
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
You're so mean.

276
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I had a lot of things, like a car.

277
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I had good memories of her.

278
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
If you say that, you'll end up breaking up with her.

279
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
If I say I have good memories of her?

280
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Even though we broke up?

281
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
No, no, no.

282
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
If I say I have good memories of her?

283
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
There were a lot.

284
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
What kind of memories?

285
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
We had a good chemistry.

286
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
We had a good chemistry?

287
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Yes.

288
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
How did you end up breaking up with her?

289
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I had a good chemistry with her.

290
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I had a good chemistry with her.

291
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Your voice is loud.

292
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Ah, this is loud.

293
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
It's like a voice that pierces the darkness.

294
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
It's like Gao.

295
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
You're a foreigner.

296
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
You're a foreigner.

297
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
This is hard.

298
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Your nipples were amazing.

299
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
It was like an indie dance.

300
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Why?

301
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
It was amazing.

302
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Really?

303
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
You broke up because you didn't like it?

304
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Of course, of course.

305
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I actually liked the indie dance.

306
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I see.

307
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
There was no reason for it.

308
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
We dated for two and a half years.

309
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I didn't know.

310
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I didn't know.

311
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I knew you were cheating on me.

312
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Ah, at that time.

313
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Yes, yes, yes.

314
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
So I was being played.

315
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I see, I see.

316
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I was the only one who had an indie dance.

317
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
You have an indie dance?

318
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Yes.

319
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Well, that's good.

320
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
It was like a pistachio.

321
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
It's getting bigger and bigger.

322
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I'm sorry to ask such a stupid question.

323
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
What's going on in the afterlife?

324
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I don't think I've ever talked about this before.

325
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Oh, really?

326
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
If you talk about the afterlife,

327
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
everyone calls it Samba Tetsurou.

328
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Yes, yes, yes.

329
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
But to be honest,

330
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Samba Tetsurou is not a big deal.

331
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Is what he's saying true?

332
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
It's almost a lie.

333
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Really?

334
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Yes.

335
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
What's a lie?

336
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
For example.

337
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
What is it?

338
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
What is it?

339
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Please tell me the right thing.

340
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
The afterlife.

341
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Oh, that's fine.

342
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
In the end, the afterlife is

343
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
basically the same as now.

344
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
You can say it's exactly the same.

345
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I see.

346
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
But everyone has a bad face.

347
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
And it's exactly the same.

348
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
There's a convenience store.

349
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Really?

350
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Yes.

351
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Basically.

352
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
There's also going to hell.

353
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Oh, yes, yes.

354
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
What about that? Are you really going to hell?

355
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
No, that's true.

356
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
But basically, it's almost the same as now.

357
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Even if you go to hell?

358
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Even if you go to hell,

359
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
it's almost the same.

360
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
If it's the same, there's no point in going to hell.

361
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
If you go to hell, you'll get beaten up.

362
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Should I change that?

363
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
If you don't change it,

364
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
it's because your face is bad.

365
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Should I change it?

366
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Is it that bad?

367
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
You can always change it.

368
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Please change it.

369
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
What is it?

370
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
If your face is bad, it's okay.

371
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
But if you live the same life,

372
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
it's a little different.

373
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Based on what you just said?

374
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Basically, I don't have a good appetite today.

375
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
But I'll figure something out.

376
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
You'll figure something out.

377
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Right?

378
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I'll figure something out.

379
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I'll do that.

380
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
What do you want to do?

381
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I'll start with something.

382
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I'll do anything.

383
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Is it a world of work?

384
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Yes.

385
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Please.

386
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Is there heaven and hell?

387
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
You can start from there.

388
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Yes, yes, yes.

389
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
It's said that there is.

390
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
There is.

391
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
There is?

392
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Yes.

393
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
But there is a difference, right?

394
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Of course.

395
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
There is an absolute difference.

396
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Please tell me about it.

397
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
The absolute difference is the T-shirt.

398
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Are you wearing a heaven T-shirt or a hell T-shirt?

399
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Who did you get that from?

400
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
From a demon.

401
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
There is a demon at a branch store.

402
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
At that time, you ask if it's M or L.

403
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I just saw it.

404
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
You keep asking if it's M or L.

405
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I just want to wear it roughly.

406
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I want to wear it roughly.

407
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I want to wear it roughly.

408
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I'm sorry.

409
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
So what?

410
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
If you get a hell T-shirt, you get hell.

411
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
If you get a hell T-shirt, you get hell.

412
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
And you're going to hell.

413
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Yes, yes, yes.

414
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
To be honest, I'm going to hell.

415
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I've done a lot of bad things.

416
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
You've done a lot of bad things.

417
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I've killed 12 people.

418
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I'm going to hell.

419
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I'm going to hell.

420
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Why?

421
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Why are you going to hell?

422
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I'm going to hell.

423
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I'm going to hell.

424
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I'm going to hell.

425
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I'm going to hell.

426
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I'm going to hell.

427
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I'm going to hell.

428
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
You're going to hell.

429
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I'm going to hell.

430
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I'm going to hell.

431
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I'm going to hell.

432
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I'm going to hell.

433
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
What are you saying?

434
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Matsumoto-san, who has always been careful when using words...

435
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
...tell me how to use it in our everyday conversation.

436
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
What is that in your everyday conversation?

437
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:32,000
People often say Inoki Bombaye, right?

438
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Actually, there are many people who don't understand the meaning.

439
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I don't understand, I don't understand. What?

440
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
What?

441
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Inoki Bombaye.

442
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Well, I'm saying it because it makes sense.

443
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
What is it? Tell me.

444
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
What is it? Inoki Bombaye.

445
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Inoki Bombaye!

446
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Bombaye!

447
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
It's embarrassing to say it.

448
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
It's not embarrassing at all.

449
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Inoki Bombaye.

450
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
What is it?

451
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
There are things you use in your daily life, right?

452
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Tell me.

453
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
When do you use Inoki Bombaye?

454
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
In your daily conversation.

455
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Tell me.

456
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Do you use it?

457
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
I heard how to use it.

458
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Oh, that's how you use it.

459
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Well, for example, where are you going?

460
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
What?

461
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Well, where are you going with you today?

462
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Where are you going?

463
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Where are you going?

464
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Well, I'm going to the amusement park.

465
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Oh, the amusement park.

466
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Let's go to the amusement park.

467
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
There are a lot of places to use in the amusement park.

468
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Really?

469
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Yes.

470
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
How do you use it?

471
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Well, for example, what do you want to ride?

472
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
What do you want to ride?

473
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
What do you want to ride today?

474
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Well, the roller coaster.

475
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Let's go on the roller coaster.

476
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Well, I wonder where the roller coaster is.

477
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Bombaye.

478
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Bombaye.

479
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
What?

480
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Where is the roller coaster?

481
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Well, that's...

482
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I'm sorry.

483
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I'm sorry.

484
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
The roller coaster is...

485
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Bombaye.

486
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
What?

487
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Oh, this way?

488
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Bombaye.

489
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
It's better to say, I'm sorry.

490
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
You can use it for anything.

491
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
That's right.

492
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
It doesn't mean anything.

493
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Is that what it means?

494
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
What do you mean?

495
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
If we say it like this,

496
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I'm sorry.

497
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
It's close to, I'm sorry.

498
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
I'm sorry.

499
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Why?

500
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Why did you say, I'm sorry, Inoki?

501
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
What?

502
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
What?

503
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
You said, I'm sorry, Inoki.

504
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
That's why you came in.

505
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
That's right.

506
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
That's right.

507
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I don't understand.

508
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Why?

509
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I'm sorry, Inoki.

510
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
You shouldn't apologize for that.

511
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Why?

512
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
What?

513
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Why shouldn't I apologize?

514
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Well, you're already losing with your chin.

515
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:12,000
You don't have a chin, but you say, I'm sorry, Inoki, just like Inoki.

516
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
What?

517
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
You're crazy.

518
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
That's not it.

519
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
What are you talking about?

520
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Inoki can do a lot of things.

521
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
That's right.

522
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Right?

523
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
If it's Inoki, everyone here can do a lot of things.

524
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
That's right.

525
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
But what about you and me?

526
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Have you ever lost to Inoki?

527
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Raise your hand if you have.

528
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
You haven't.

529
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Inoki has forgiven you for that.

530
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
That's strange.

531
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:50,000
That's why I said, I'm sorry, Inoki.

532
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
I'm really sorry.

533
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
I'm really sorry.

534
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
You're sorry for being forgiven.

535
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
I'm really sorry.

536
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Inoki knows how to use Bombayi, but in the amusement park, he says, I'm sorry, Bombayi.

537
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
That's the only way you can use it.

538
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
You can use it anywhere else.

539
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Where do you use it?

540
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
I know how to use it now, if you explain the reason.

541
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
I'm sorry.

542
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Bombayi.

543
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Where's the jet box?

544
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
It's over there.

545
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Bombayi.

546
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
I know that.

547
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Where else do you use it?

548
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
It's getting cold, isn't it?

549
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
It's Bombayi.

550
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
What?

551
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Why are you holding it?

552
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
It's Bombayi.

553
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
It's Bombayi.

554
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
That's strange.

555
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
It's Bombayi.

556
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I don't understand.

557
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
You said it in the morning.

558
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
It's not good weather today.

559
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
It's Bombayi.

560
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
It's Bombayi.

561
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
How many times?

562
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
It's Bombayi.

563
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
I don't understand how you use it.

564
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I don't understand.

565
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
I understand.

566
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
It's not good weather today.

567
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I don't understand.

568
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
It's strange.

569
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
It's strange.

570
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
I understand the elevator.

571
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Why did you go to the train station?

572
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I understand that.

573
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Coffee.

574
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Yes.

575
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Do you have a cigarette?

576
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
It's a super light.

577
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
I don't understand.

578
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
I understand.

579
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
The coffee was cheap.

580
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
It's Bombayi.

581
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
That's strange.

582
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
That's strange.

583
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Why is it strange?

584
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
It's not Bombayi.

585
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
It's not Bombayi.

586
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
It's strange.

587
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
It's not Bombayi.

588
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Mothers use it a lot.

589
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,000
When you wake up in the morning,

590
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:49,000
it's Bombayi.

591
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
It's Bombayi.

592
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,000
It's Bombayi.

593
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I don't understand.

594
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
It's Bombayi.

595
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
I don't understand.

596
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
I don't understand.

597
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
I don't understand your last word.

598
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
It's Bombayi.

599
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
I don't understand.

600
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
It's not Bombayi.

601
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
How many times?

602
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
How many times do I have to tell you?

603
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
It's Bombayi.

604
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
My mother is a noisy person.

605
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
What the hell are you doing?
