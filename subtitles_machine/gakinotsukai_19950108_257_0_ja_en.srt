1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Chikichiki! Dr. Matsumoto's sudden-strike entertainer!

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Score!

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Teacher.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Yes?

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
This is the second time.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
That's right. You can't finish this machine in one go.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
But I understood the size of the first entertainer.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
After that, the guests came to my studio.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Why did you understand?

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I was surprised.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Isn't it the same?

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
It's the same, Masao.

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Well, this time too.

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Well, this year we don't have enough water.

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Yes, yes, yes.

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
It's true.

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It was last year.

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
It's a project that really shows the entertainer's ***.

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
We don't have enough rice.

20
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Last year, right?

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Yes.

22
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Let's go now.

23
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
This program is provided by the sponsor you are watching.

24
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm Kageki Shimoda.

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I'm a teacher.

26
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm a teacher.

27
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Do you have any stories like that?

28
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Well, it's not a story.

29
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I had an interesting dream when I was in my 20s.

30
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I fell asleep in the field of spring and woke up suddenly.

31
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I was wondering what had happened to me.

32
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I saw a wing and I was waiting around here.

33
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
It's a wonderful dream.

34
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I will never forget it.

35
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I see.

36
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Let's see Kageki's ***.

37
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I have two questions.

38
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Let's go.

39
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
It's impossible to buy a condom, so I use a semi-transparent garbage bag.

40
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
That's not true.

41
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
When I was an electrician, UFO contacted me for some reason.

42
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I have a similar feeling to that.

43
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Is it true?

44
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Is it true?

45
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
It depends on the angle.

46
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Yes.

47
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
It's like an antenna.

48
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I got it.

49
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Did you get it?

50
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Yes.

51
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Please.

52
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
It's moving away.

53
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I got it.

54
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
This is good.

55
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
This is a good one.

56
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
It's thin.

57
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
It's thin.

58
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
It's thin, but the front one is cool.

59
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Is it cool?

60
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Yes.

61
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
But it's not that long.

62
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
It's not that long.

63
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I see.

64
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
It's blue and red.

65
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Is it like this?

66
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
It's closed.

67
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
It's like this.

68
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Right.

69
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I see.

70
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
It's like this.

71
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
It's like this.

72
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Kageki's ***.

73
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Next one, please.

74
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
It's a man.

75
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Good evening.

76
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Good evening.

77
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
He's a professional.

78
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
It's morning.

79
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I see.

80
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Thank you.

81
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I didn't hear it.

82
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Really?

83
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I didn't hear your ***.

84
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I wonder what it is.

85
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I've been *** since I was born.

86
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I'm serious.

87
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Really?

88
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I'm serious.

89
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I was born in America.

90
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I see.

91
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
It's like that.

92
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
He's saying I'm a ***.

93
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
He's saying I'm a ***.

94
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I understand that.

95
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Really?

96
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
When I see a small ***, I feel like I'm going to throw up.

97
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Why?

98
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Yes.

99
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Why do you feel like you're going to throw up?

100
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I don't know.

101
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Say it out loud.

102
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
***.

103
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
What?

104
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Who said ***?

105
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
It's okay.

106
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
It's like that.

107
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
You're like a TV host.

108
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Thank you.

109
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
What's your favorite name?

110
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Does it matter?

111
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
What?

112
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Daikoku?

113
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Daikoku.

114
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
That's good.

115
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Okay, I got it.

116
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I got it.

117
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Let's go.

118
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Kuroda's morning ***.

119
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,000
What?

120
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I got it.

121
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Are you sick?

122
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
You have a big fat.

123
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
It was so big that it didn't even come out of it.

124
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Number 3.

125
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Congratulations.

126
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
What are you talking about?

127
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Congratulations.

128
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
What are you talking about?

129
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Congratulations.

130
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I look forward to working with you again this year.

131
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Thank you.

132
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Thank you.

133
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
What's your case like?

134
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
It's a little bent.

135
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Normally people turn towards themselves.

136
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
This *** is facing the other way.

137
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
It's facing the other way.

138
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
It's facing the other way.

139
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
It's facing the other way.

140
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
It's looking at the future.

141
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
It's looking at the future.

142
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Is that so?

143
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I've thought about it.

144
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Please sit down.

145
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:14,000
When I went to Africa, for some reason, people I met mistreated me.

146
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
That's the problem.

147
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
That's the problem.

148
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
That's the brain.

149
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Please shout out the name of the teacher.

150
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
What? Teacher?

151
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Teacher Yuya!

152
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Yes, okay.

153
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
What's that?

154
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
What's that?

155
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Is it okay?

156
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Is it in?

157
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
The answer is out.

158
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,000
The *** in the class.

159
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
It's out.

160
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
What is it?

161
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
The *** in the class.

162
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
And it's yellow.

163
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
What is it?

164
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
It's a tough ***.

165
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
It's Kuroda Awa-san's ***.

166
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
What?

167
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Kuroda Awa-san's *** is amazing.

168
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Look at this.

169
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
It's this.

170
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
It's dirty.

171
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
What is it?

172
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
But this is a future type, right?

173
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
This is a future type.

174
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Is this a future type?

175
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
It's called a ***.

176
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
This is Ebisu.

177
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
This is Ebisu-san.

178
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Speaking of Ebisu-san, the shadow of a woman is always there.

179
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Where is it?

180
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
It's not there at all.

181
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Is there anything like that before?

182
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Once, I was walking around Osaka.

183
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
There was a place called Nozokibuya.

184
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
There was a man with a placard.

185
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
It said 1000 yen.

186
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I thought it would be nice if it was 1000 yen.

187
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Did you go in?

188
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I went in.

189
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
When I went in, a woman came.

190
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:52,000
She said she would give 5000 yen if I showed her something nice.

191
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
When I gave her 1000 yen, she said she was sorry.

192
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
She said she didn't have any change.

193
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
She said she would call a younger man.

194
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
A young man came with a beer.

195
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
It's a long story.

196
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
It's okay.

197
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,000
A woman came and gave me money.

198
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I told her that I had already done it.

199
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I told her to wait for a while.

200
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I waited for about 10 minutes and no one came.

201
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I looked over there and it wasn't funny at all.

202
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Then she came back.

203
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I didn't do anything.

204
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Don't you think your story is funny?

205
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
This is a joke.

206
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
It takes a lot of time.

207
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
She came back.

208
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Mr. Ebisu is like this.

209
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Let's go.

210
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,000
When you get on a plane, you are treated as valuable.

211
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Why is that?

212
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
What is this?

213
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
This is a joke.

214
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Please imitate it.

215
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Imitation?

216
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Anyone is fine.

217
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
The sun is burning red.

218
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Imitation of Hibari Ebisola.

219
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
It's not similar at all.

220
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I said I couldn't imitate it.

221
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Please jump.

222
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:41,000
This is good.

223
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I got the answer.

224
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Did you get it?

225
00:08:44,000 --> 00:09:08,000
What is this?

226
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
This is a joke.

227
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I'm scared.

228
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
What is this?

229
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:27,000
This is a joke.

230
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
This is not so big.

231
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
This is amazing.

232
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Mr. Ebisu was scared to run away.

233
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:55,000
He was about to be pulled by his own butt.

234
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
What is this?

235
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I'm really angry today.

236
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
What is this?

237
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
It's an article on Tohsupo.

238
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
This time it's disbanded.

239
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Thank you very much.

240
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
What do you think of this theory?

241
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I'm really surprised.

242
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
It happened before.

243
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,000
What is this?

244
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
It's disbanded.

245
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Suddenly, I have a cramp.

246
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
It's not a cramp.

247
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Suddenly I have a cramp.

248
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I have a cramp in front of me.

249
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Is that so?

250
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I'm fine now.

251
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Let's deceive Mr. Kaizawa.

252
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I will be caught.

253
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Recently it's terrible.

254
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
What is terrible?

255
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:08,000
A while ago, I was sent to the police station.

256
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I don't care about that.

257
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
How many hours did it take?

258
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
What?

259
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I was sent to the police station.

260
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Two or three hours.

261
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:32,000
The other day, I was caught by a woman in Ikebukuro.

262
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
The woman woke up the next day and saw me.

263
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I said, good morning.

264
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I don't know how to put it.

265
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I said, good morning.

266
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Why me?

267
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
There are many people who don't say good morning to that woman.

268
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Why you?

269
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:58,000
When I said good morning, I was caught.

270
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I don't know how to put it.

271
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
What do you want me to do?

272
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I can't help it because I'm selfish.

273
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Since the day I made my debut, I have been selfish.

274
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
You say you are late.

275
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I have never been late.

276
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,000
That's right.

277
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I don't want to be hit by you.

278
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I beg you.

279
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:42,000
The number of times I hit Matsumoto has decreased.

280
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
You can't do that.

281
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
You can't write a newspaper or a weekly magazine.

282
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
It's all the thoughts of a reporter.

283
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
You write your opinion.

284
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Finally, you write the name of the person involved.

285
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I wrote it.

286
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
There is no reason to say that.

287
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
There is no reason to say that.

288
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Everyone around me likes me.

289
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Do you think so?

290
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I'll say that, so wait.

291
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,000
It's better to say good-bye.

292
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:27,000
If you don't say good-bye, the audience's reaction will be strange.

293
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
When is next year?

294
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
February 14th.

295
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Good-bye on Valentine's Day.

296
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Good-bye.

297
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:41,000
The audience's reaction will be strange.

298
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
That's right.

299
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:50,000
It's because you're in the way of my work.

300
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Do you have a lot of prank calls?

301
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I don't know.

302
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:02,000
The other day, someone knocked on the door of my house.

303
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Is it a prank call?

304
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
It's a prank call.

305
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
It's not a prank call.

306
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Do you know?

307
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
There was a movie about a prank call.

308
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:18,000
After the prank call, I called him.

309
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I told him not to call me again.

310
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:29,000
If he calls me again, I can't call him again.

311
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
That's good.

312
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
That's good.

313
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
The problem is, for example, where are you?

314
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I'm not dead.

315
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Wait a minute.

316
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I'll call you a different prank.

317
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I'm not dead.

318
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
It's a joke.

319
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I'll call you and tell you not to pick up the phone.

320
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
For example, you came to my house to play.

321
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I don't have a phone.

322
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
You don't have a phone.

323
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I'm going to call your house.

324
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:06,000
If you don't pick up the phone, you'll be caught.

325
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:12,000
You'll be caught.

326
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I'll call you.

327
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I'll call you.

328
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I'll call you.

329
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I'll call you.

330
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I'll call you.

331
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I don't have a phone.

332
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
It's okay if you don't pick up the phone.

333
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I'll think about it.

334
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
That's good.

335
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
This is the first time this year.

336
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Nice to meet you.

337
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Nice to meet you.

338
00:15:49,000 --> 00:16:00,000
What do you want to do this year?

339
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I want you to call me.

340
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
What do you want to do this year?

341
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I don't want to change anything.

342
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
What is your goal?

343
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
You said something last year.

344
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
What did I see last year?

345
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
You said you'd be twice as good as last year.

346
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I said I'd be twice as good.

347
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
You said you'd be twice as good.

348
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I said I'd be twice as good.

349
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Everyone doesn't know, but I'm twice as good.

350
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
No.

351
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:36,000
No, you're twice as good.

352
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
You're saying everyone is twice as good.

353
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Everyone is twice as good.

354
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I didn't know why.

355
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
This is a mistake.

356
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I didn't expect everyone to be twice as good.

357
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I see

358
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I'll do it too

359
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
What?

360
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I'll tell you what I'm planning this year

361
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Yes

362
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Time limit

363
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
That's enough

364
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
That's enough

365
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
If you came on time, you wouldn't have recorded it

366
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I'm sorry

367
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Why?

368
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,000
At work, I went to work at 2 o'clock

369
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
No one was there

370
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
This is...

371
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I went to work at 2 o'clock

372
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I went in before 3 o'clock

373
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I went in and I was sitting

374
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I went into the dressing room and I was sitting

375
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I was like this

376
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
There was nothing

377
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
There was nothing

378
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
There was nothing

379
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I remembered a lot of things from my childhood

380
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,000
That kind of time is necessary

381
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
So you were in the dressing room

382
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
You were 3 hours late

383
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I was 3 hours late

384
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Right?

385
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
That's why you can't be on time

386
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I have a problem

387
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
The more I'm late, the more the show will fail

388
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,000
That's just what you think

389
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,000
If I come on time...

390
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
It's shaking

391
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
It's shaking

392
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:33,000
It's shaking a lot

393
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
It's hard

394
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Why?

395
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
That's why you can't be on time

396
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
You don't have to say it

397
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
What should I do?

398
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
What do you mean by what you just said?

399
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
What do you mean by what you just said?

400
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
What do you mean by what you just said?

401
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
The building will collapse

402
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
I don't want to work with these people

403
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I can't beat the earthquake

404
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,000
The earthquake of the time machine is also the origin

405
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Zabutomo teacher

406
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
It's okay here

407
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
It's over

408
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
It's over

409
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I'm the mother of the first man

410
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Thank you

411
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Our skyline was damaged

412
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Really?

413
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
The car fell down

414
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Don't talk too much

415
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,000
I saw on TV that the car was a lie

416
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I see

417
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
It was true

418
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Are you in the car now?

419
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I took a picture of the car

420
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I changed the light

421
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I'm a beautiful woman

422
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:12,000
I'm a beautiful woman

423
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I feel good

424
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
That's all for today

425
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
You can go home

426
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
It's still okay

427
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
It's still okay

428
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
It's okay

429
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
You can go home

430
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
I don't know what you're talking about

431
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
It's amazing

432
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
What about dogs?

433
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Dogs can't swim like a dog?

434
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Dogs can't swim like a dog?

435
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
But dogs can't swim

436
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Dogs can't swim

437
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
I don't think so

438
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
That's all

439
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Don't look down on dogs

440
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Don't look down on dogs

441
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Why did you say it again?

442
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Say it again

443
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I'm a man

444
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Say it again

445
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I'm sorry

446
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Am I looking down on dogs?

447
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I'm looking down on dogs

448
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
There's one more thing

449
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
There is

450
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Can you teach me?

451
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Diving

452
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
He's dead

453
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
He's a man

454
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I don't know

455
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
I don't know how to teach

456
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
I don't know how to teach

457
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I don't know how to teach

458
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:57,000
What happened to the fight between Keisuke Kuwata and Tsuyoshi Nagabuchi?

459
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,000
I was at Izumiya's show the other day

460
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I said I'll join if you fight

461
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I said you'll get beaten if you say that

462
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
He said yes

463
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I'm weak

464
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:20,000
I thought the same thing

465
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Wait a minute

466
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
What do you mean?

467
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,000
I wanted to join when something happened

468
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,000
I don't know who you are

469
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:41,000
I think you know who I am

470
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:45,000
I don't have anything to do with you

471
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
When you look at me like that

472
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I don't know who you are

473
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
There are a lot of celebrities

474
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,000
I'm the only one who knows

475
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,000
This is the truth

476
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Is that so?

477
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Even if Keisuke Kuwata and Tsuyoshi Nagabuchi fight

478
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,000
I'll say wait a minute

479
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Have you talked to him?

480
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
What?

481
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
With Kuwata and Nagabuchi

482
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,000
What?

483
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Where did you come from?

484
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
From your house?

485
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
No

486
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
From your house?

487
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
From Tsuyoshi's house

488
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,000
I'm the one who said this is a harmonica

489
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
How many years has it been?

490
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Machan

491
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Who is that?

492
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Nagabuchi

493
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Machan listen

494
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
What's wrong, Tsuyoshi?

495
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Why are you shaking so much?

496
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Are you shaking?

497
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
This is no good

498
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
He said

499
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
I want to play the guitar

500
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
I want to play the harmonica

501
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Machan, what should I do?

502
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Cry

503
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,000
I see, listen to that

504
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Put this on
