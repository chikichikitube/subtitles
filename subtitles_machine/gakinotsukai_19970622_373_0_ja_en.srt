1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
In the first episode of Gaki no Tsukai Arai, Chikijiki Miyaji's dramatic action, cue!

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
This time, I, Oosaki Yamazaki...

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Oosaki?

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
That's my real name!

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I'm going to give you a special quiz using Miyaji.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Let me introduce the panel.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Downtown Tsukkomi, Hamada Masatoshi!

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Today, we have Miyaji as our guest.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
How do you feel?

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I want to see how Miyaji moves.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
You're not in the mood!

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
You're not in the mood!

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Last but not least, Masumoto Hidashi!

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Yamazaki-san has done this before, but I don't think he's done it yet.

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
What are you talking about?

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I don't think he's done it yet.

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
It hurts when you hold it here.

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Next, we have Endo-kun and Tanaka-kun!

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
What do you think he's doing?

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
What?

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
What do you think he's doing?

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I think he's doing the right thing.

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I think he's doing his best.

24
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Let's see your reactions one by one.

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Are you going to answer seriously?

26
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Please answer seriously.

27
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Where do you think he's doing it?

28
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
If there's a chance, I want him to do it more and more.

29
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I can't do it!

30
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
He's the god of comedy!

31
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Everyone is the god!

32
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
What are you doing?

33
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
B1 producer, Sugakenshi!

34
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Good evening!

35
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
You have a good smile.

36
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
You have to admit that your attitude is different.

37
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Sugakenshi, you're in trouble.

38
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
That's good.

39
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:13,000
The winner will receive 100,000 yen from me!

40
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Really?

41
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Show us!

42
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Do you have your wallet?

43
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
My wallet is upstairs.

44
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
That's not good.

45
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I don't understand.

46
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Let's start over.

47
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
The winner will receive...

48
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
This is Yamazaki-san.

49
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Is this okay?

50
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
The winner will receive...

51
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
This too.

52
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
This program is brought to you by these sponsors.

53
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Let's go to the first question!

54
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Let's do it together!

55
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Dramatic Action Q!

56
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Dramatic Action Q!

57
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I'm from Kitamachi.

58
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I'm the daughter of Toyama Saemon.

59
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Nice to meet you!

60
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I've been here for a year.

61
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I've been here for a year.

62
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Everyone, please raise your hands!

63
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Why is Otomo speaking in English?

64
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Yuki, is it true that you were forced to leave your father's home

65
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
to pay for the rent?

66
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Yes, that is correct.

67
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
What kind of father is he?

68
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
He grabbed my chest with both hands and pushed me up and down.

69
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Is there anything wrong with that?

70
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Don't be afraid!

71
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Unfortunately, I don't know what you're talking about.

72
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Who are you talking to?

73
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Shut up!

74
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I've been here for a year and I've seen all of Toyama's cherry blossoms!

75
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Stop!

76
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Here's the question.

77
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:42,000
How many times can Mr. Kin shake his left and right breasts in 30 seconds?

78
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Let's do two at a time.

79
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Mr. Kawada.

80
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Go ahead.

81
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
110 times.

82
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Mr. Matsumoto.

83
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
It's a little short.

84
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
87 times.

85
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Left and right.

86
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Is that so?

87
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Yes.

88
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
What are you going to do?

89
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Is that so?

90
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Didn't you hear what I said?

91
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I really wanted you to say that.

92
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Turn off the camera.

93
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Turn off the camera.

94
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Let's do our best.

95
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I'm serious right now.

96
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I'm sorry.

97
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
You said you'd do your best.

98
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I did.

99
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Let's go!

100
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
120 times.

101
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Let's go with Mr. Kin.

102
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
You can't go over that.

103
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Mr. Tsubasa.

104
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
121 times.

105
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Let's see the answer.

106
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Dramatic action!

107
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Cue!

108
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
That was fast!

109
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
That was really fast!

110
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Don't laugh!

111
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Don't laugh!

112
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Don't laugh!

113
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Don't laugh!

114
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Don't laugh!

115
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Don't laugh!

116
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

117
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I don't know what she's doing either.

118
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Look at her face.

119
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Look at her face.

120
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
85 times for the right breast.

121
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
127 times for the left breast.

122
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,000
And 212 times for the right breast.

123
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
That means...

124
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
There's no correct answer.

125
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
But if it was Jinjitsu...

126
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Mr. Tsubasa.

127
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
If you overdo it, you're out.

128
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I didn't overdo it.

129
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
You didn't?

130
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I didn't overdo it.

131
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Then stop it.

132
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
The second time.

133
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Let's do our best.

134
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Let's do our best.

135
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Let's do our best.

136
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Did you overdo it?

137
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I didn't overdo it.

138
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Mr. Tsubasa is correct!

139
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
One point.

140
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:06,000
That was easy.

141
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Let's move on to the next question.

142
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Let's move on to the next question.

143
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Let's go!

144
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Let's go!

145
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Why aren't you talking to me?

146
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I agree.

147
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
The world is heavy, so let's dance.

148
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
On the other hand,

149
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
a woman's heart is heavy.

150
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
It's a piece of cake.

151
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
How to get out.

152
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
It's a little difficult.

153
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Let's work!

154
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Let's work!

155
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
There are 50 pieces of underwear

156
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
that Lupin wore on stage.

157
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
How many pieces can you take in one minute

158
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
with that magic hand

159
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:57,000
and put on your head?

160
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Dramatic Action Cue!

161
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:11,000
How many pieces can you take in one minute

162
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
with that magic hand

163
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
and put on your head?

164
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Teacher.

165
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Teacher is working now.

166
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Fujiko-chan!

167
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Fujiko-chan!

168
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Fujiko-chan!

169
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Fujiko-chan!

170
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

171
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
6 pieces in one minute!

172
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
That's right!

173
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Oh, the sun, the sun.

174
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Oh, it hurts.

175
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Oh, it hurts.

176
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Fujiko-chan!

177
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Fujiko-chan!

178
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Can I say something?

179
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

180
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Dramatic Action Cue!

181
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
How many pieces can you take in one minute

182
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
with that magic hand

183
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
and put on your head?

184
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Teacher.

185
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Teacher is working now.

186
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
His last name is Kuruma.

187
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
His name is Tranjiro.

188
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Welcome!

189
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
My name is Kelake.

190
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
My name is Chiyoda.

191
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I'm going to drink champagne today.

192
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
This champagne!

193
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
What is it?

194
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
This is it.

195
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
What are you talking about?

196
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Don't be so scary.

197
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
You can't do that!

198
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
You can't do that!

199
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Stop!

200
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I don't understand, what do you want to do?

201
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I'll explain.

202
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Tora-san was about to sell champagne

203
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
There are 5 bottles of champagne

204
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
The question is how many seconds it takes to open all of them

205
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
About 2 minutes and a half

206
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I think it takes about 30 seconds for one bottle

207
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
You hit a good spot

208
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I want to make more noise

209
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Matsumoto-san

210
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
28 minutes

211
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
It takes this long

212
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
The pacemaker stops in the middle

213
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
It has nothing to do with the heart

214
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
11 minutes

215
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
That's a long time

216
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
What is this?

217
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I think it takes about 1 minute and a half

218
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
1 minute and a half is 6 minutes

219
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I didn't say anything

220
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I just said it

221
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
It hurts to hit the pacemaker like this

222
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Is that so?

223
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I understand

224
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Stop it

225
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I understand

226
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Do you have enough time?

227
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Yes

228
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Let's talk

229
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
The last one

230
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
1 minute and 25 seconds

231
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
1 minute and 25 seconds

232
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Dramatic action

233
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
It hurts

234
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
What is this?

235
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
It's fast

236
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
It's really fast

237
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Don't look at me

238
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
It's really fast

239
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
It's really fast

240
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Amazing

241
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
The correct answer is

242
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
1 minute and 25 seconds

243
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Congratulations

244
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
You can't say that

245
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
2 points

246
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Suga-san wins

247
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Suga-san wins

248
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Thank you

249
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Congratulations

250
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Yamasaki is okay

251
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
We'll do it next

252
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Don't say yes

253
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
This is better

254
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
This is better

255
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I'm confident that I can do better

256
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I'm confident

257
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Let's do it

258
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Let's do it

259
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
It's okay

260
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Let's go to the next question

261
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Miyaji-san's dramatic action

262
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Cue

263
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
The correct answer is

264
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
The correct answer is

265
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
The correct answer is

266
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Are there only people?

267
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
You can't say that

268
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Is there a reverse?

269
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
If there's no reverse, we can't do it

270
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
If you win

271
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I'll give you 2 points

272
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
It's a reverse

273
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
3 points

274
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Yamasaki, where are you going?

275
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Look at this

276
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
3 points

277
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Let's do our best

278
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Let's do it

279
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Let's do it

280
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I said it before

281
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
What?

282
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I don't know the reason

283
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
What?

284
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I don't know

285
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
When I got in the car

286
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
There was a strong smell of poop

287
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
There was a strong smell of poop

288
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
There was a strong smell of poop

289
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I was wondering why

290
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I couldn't open the window

291
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I looked at my slippers

292
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I was pooping

293
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I know the reason

294
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I know the reason

295
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I don't know

296
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I don't know where I pooped

297
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Before I got in the car

298
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I puke

299
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I didn't go anywhere

300
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I didn't go anywhere

301
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I didn't getсят

302
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I didn't get anything

303
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I didn't get anything

304
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
What kind of place am I living in?

305
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I don't know

306
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
You probably went to the bathroom

307
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
You probably went to the bathroom

308
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
You haha

309
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
You don't even abused it

310
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
You don't Glen

311
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
You pooped it

312
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:56,000
And that's when it all ended. You threw away your slippers, right?

313
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
That was good, right?

314
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Yeah, it was good.

315
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
And when you got home, there was no one in the car.

316
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I thought that was the end of it.

317
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
And that day, you went home and took a shower, right?

318
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
You took a shower and went to bed, right?

319
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
And when you got to the bed, you were like,

320
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
What the hell?

321
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I knew it!

322
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
It was you!

323
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
No, it wasn't!

324
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
No, it wasn't!

325
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
This is one of the 7 mysteries.

326
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I smelled poop again and wondered why.

327
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
And that day, I went to bed.

328
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I put up with it.

329
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
You slept well, didn't you?

330
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
You were in bed and smelled like poop.

331
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
And the next day, I smelled poop again.

332
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
You did that before you went to bed, didn't you?

333
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Of course, the next day, I took a shower and went to bed.

334
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
But when I got to the bed, I smelled poop again.

335
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I was like, what the hell?

336
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Before I went to bed, I smelled poop again.

337
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
What the hell?

338
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
No, it wasn't.

339
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
No, it wasn't!

340
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
You can't lie like that!

341
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
How did you know it was poop?

342
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
It was brown.

343
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
It was brown.

344
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Where?

345
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
From the back.

346
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
How did you know it was poop?

347
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I went to the bathroom and smelled it.

348
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I smelled it, but why did I smell poop again?

349
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Who did it?

350
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I did it little by little.

351
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Little by little?

352
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Little by little.

353
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Little by little.

354
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I did it little by little.

355
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
No, it wasn't.

356
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
It wasn't.

357
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Why?

358
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
It wasn't!

359
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
You can't say that as a partner.

360
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
But you can only think of it as an outsider.

361
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I even took a shower before I went to bed.

362
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
That's strange.

363
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
You didn't smell it today?

364
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I didn't smell it today.

365
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I didn't smell it today.

366
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Well, I did smell it in my underwear.

367
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I don't care about that.

368
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
What do you mean you don't care?

369
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
You should be more worried about it.

370
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
It's my butt. It has nothing to do with me.

371
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
What do you mean it has nothing to do with you?

372
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
What?

373
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
What do you mean it has nothing to do with you?

374
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I'm getting angry.

375
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I'm really angry.

376
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I don't understand it at all.

377
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
There are strange things in life.

378
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I think we should talk about that later.

379
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
What is it?

380
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
You know Sazaebon, right?

381
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Yes.

382
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I'm the one who came up with that.

383
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I wrote about it on an evening show in Osaka.

384
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Just once.

385
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
That's right. It was about 10 years ago.

386
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Everyone is talking about Sazaebon now.

387
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I get angry every time I see it.

388
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
It was in the court, right?

389
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,000
What the hell is this?

390
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Go to the court.

391
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Why are you backing out?

392
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I wanted to go forward.

393
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
This is the real deal.

394
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Go to the court.

395
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I went down once to go to the court.

396
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I went down to go forward.

397
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
That's right.

398
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
It's the principle of the lower class.

399
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Go to the court.

400
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Don't say it every time.

401
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Go to the court.

402
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Hey, don't do this.

403
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,000
How many times have you done this on this show?

404
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I'm sure there are a lot of VTRs.

405
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Is it a picture?

406
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
That's right.

407
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
It's true.

408
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
It's true.

409
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
But you have to back me up.

410
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
What?

411
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
When I say something, you say,

412
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Soya, soya, soya.

413
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Soya, soya.

414
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Why can't I say it?

415
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Say it.

416
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I don't need that kind of love.

417
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Say it.

418
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I'll be there soon.

419
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Okay.

420
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
You can't do that.

421
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:08,000
You can't do that.

422
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
When Hamada-san broke his leg,

423
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,000
At night, Hamada-san ran around the hospital in Tokyo.

424
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I'll ask Mr. Matsumoto of Aikata Moe.

425
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Yes.

426
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
In some kind of accident,

427
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Yes.

428
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
When you lost your leg,

429
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Before you go to the hospital,

430
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
If there's something you have to do first,

431
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
If there's something like emergency treatment,

432
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Please tell me.

433
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
This is not a joke.

434
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,000
It's not a joke.

435
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
It's not like you can get it.

436
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Why?

437
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I say everything that has a shape breaks.

438
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
It's not like that.

439
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
When you get it,

440
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Of course you'll go to the hospital.

441
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
I'll go to the hospital.

442
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
You have to go to the hospital.

443
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
It's an emergency.

444
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
If there's something like emergency treatment before you go,

445
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
If there's something, please tell me.

446
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Do you have Makiron?

447
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Do you have Makiron?

448
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Who is that?

449
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Who is that now?

450
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
No, it's me.

451
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
There are a lot of Makiron.

452
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
It's really easy.

453
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
It's three keys.

454
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
The most troublesome thing is,

455
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
You put it like this, right?

456
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
You put it like this, right?

457
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:27,000
I've never been put in a place like this.

458
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
That's right.

459
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
By itself?

460
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
That's right.

461
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
If you leave it like this,

462
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:37,000
The bottom becomes flat.

463
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:47,000
So I want you to make a foot with a toothpick or something in your house.

464
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
I don't like Twitter.

465
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,000
I don't like Twitter.

466
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
That's really the best.

467
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
The toothpick is good, too.

468
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
I don't need a toothpick.

469
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
At one point, Mr. Matsumoto said that Hamada had an injury in his foot.

470
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
He said he was actually more sick.

471
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
What kind of disease is he really sick with?

472
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
This is...

473
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Wait a minute.

474
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Hey.

475
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I'm healthy except for my feet.

476
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
You're a close friend.

477
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
But if I say this too much, I'll get a lot of premonitions.

478
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
It's going to be really bad.

479
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I asked him later.

480
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
You said I didn't have enough glasses, right?

481
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
I looked it up.

482
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I really didn't have enough glasses.

483
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
That's not true.

484
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
That's not true.

485
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
You know,

486
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I was a judge.

487
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Why are you talking in a high voice?

488
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
It's true.

489
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
It's true that it's true.

490
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
There was a disaster, right?

491
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Yes, there was.

492
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
At that time, everyone was wearing glasses.

493
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
You put it on your pillow and go to bed, right?

494
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
It suddenly became an earthquake.

495
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Everyone rushed out of the front door.

496
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
After that, everyone had no glasses.

497
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
I'm really in trouble.

498
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I was so sad.

499
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
That's it.

500
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Actually, everyone in the family had glasses.

501
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
I'm a school club member.

502
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
I belong to the Rikujougi.

503
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
I'm throwing a gun.

504
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
The teacher told me to make a voice when I throw it.

505
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
So how do you make a voice to throw it far away?

506
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
What kind of words should I say?

507
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Please tell me.

508
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
By the way, when I ask my friends,

509
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
It seems that I'm saying,

510
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Please show me the special of the year of the diamond.

511
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Is there a special of the year of the diamond?

512
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Yes, there is.

513
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
There is.

514
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Is there?

515
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Yes, there is.

516
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Please tell me.

517
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Yes, I will.

518
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I'm not a 4th class like Toku.

519
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
I will tell you such a thing.

520
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:03,000
There is a special of the year of the diamond.

521
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Let's throw a gun.

522
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
A gun.

523
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
A gun.

524
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Don't do that.

525
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
It's the year of the cicada.

526
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
After that, it's important.

527
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
After I throw it,

528
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
I throw a gun.

529
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
There is a special of the year of the diamond.

530
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
It's not good.

531
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
The best word is,

532
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Tsumitachi.

533
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Tsumitachi.

534
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Shimura-san, go home.

535
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
I'm on the train.

536
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
It's okay.

537
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
I often fall asleep.

538
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Yes, you do.

539
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
At that time,

540
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,000
I sometimes hit my head against the window.

541
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
How should I react?

542
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
It's cool, isn't it?

543
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
It's cool, isn't it?

544
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
That's because...

545
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
I can't do it at once.

546
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
If I think it's dangerous,

547
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
I should run properly.

548
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
It's cut off by the train.

549
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
It's cut off by the train.

550
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
I should run properly.

551
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
The diamond is messed up.

552
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:24,000
This program was provided by the following sponsors.
