1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Tonight, the punishment for Bakium Fujiwara will be given.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
We will be doing the revenge game for Bakium Fujiwara in the first episode.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
The moment you see it, you will be sucked into the hell of Shumai.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
What is it?

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Before that, I have a feeling that this punishment game is not a joke.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I see.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
That's right.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Is that so?

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
You don't have to play a penalty game.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
You can be a comedian and use a steel bar.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
You can use a steel bar.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
We shoot in a great place.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
This is not easy.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
A small child looks at everyone and asks,

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Who?

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
A child without a child's instructions.

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Who is that person with a hat?

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I don't know his name.

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Let's call him.

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Fujiwara, please.

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Please.

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Please.

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Please.

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I don't remember doing anything that I would be punished.

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Sorry.

26
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
It's a waste of time to pull him.

27
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Let's do it properly.

28
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
This time, there are a lot of Shumai in the city.

29
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Bakium-san is really crazy about stomach.

30
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
He ate all the Shumai that he found.

31
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
That's all.

32
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I don't agree with that at all.

33
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Don't run away. You ran away.

34
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I ran away.

35
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Bakium Fujiwara, who aimed to be a foodie talent with the current boom.

36
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
He created a special set that he hopes for in the studio.

37
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
While his vision was blocked, he tried to eat 80 yookas.

38
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
However!

39
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
He escaped again in the middle of the night.

40
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Tonight, he will be called a new member of the Kogui family.

41
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
You said it!

42
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
The time of the Shumai hell has come!

43
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
It started quite suddenly

44
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
If we find it, please tell Fujiwara

45
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
It's here

46
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
It's a bit sudden but

47
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
It's here

48
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Oh, really?

49
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
The bar's tip!

50
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
This is how it is?

51
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
The tip is...

52
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
This is also possible, right?

53
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Then, there are many things.

54
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
You should put soy sauce properly.

55
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
That's the answer.

56
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
You're the one who should put soy sauce.

57
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Don't drop it.

58
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Take it by hand.

59
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
The temperature is low today.

60
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
The rice ball is cold.

61
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Don't drop it.

62
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
That's right.

63
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I don't care about the taste.

64
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
It's like this.

65
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
What is it?

66
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
You started again.

67
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
What are you doing?

68
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
It's true.

69
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
It's a smile.

70
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
The punch is Shumai.

71
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
It's amazing.

72
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Don't be shy.

73
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
It's food.

74
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
We can't walk without a key.

75
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Excuse me.

76
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
His...

77
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
His face...

78
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
His face is like a Shumai hell.

79
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Shumai hell.

80
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
It's almost over.

81
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Ah!

82
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
It's in the book.

83
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Shumai hell.

84
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I have to take this.

85
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Take it.

86
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
He's particular.

87
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I'll take this.

88
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
The second button?

89
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
The second button.

90
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Yu is eating a lot with this.

91
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
No, I'm not.

92
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

93
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
7.

94
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
7th.

95
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
It's not easy to get this much money.

96
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
That's right.

97
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Right?

98
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I think it's 500 yen.

99
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I can get 500 yen.

100
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
You can get 500 yen?

101
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
If you get 100 yen, it's not a game.

102
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
It's 1000 yen.

103
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
1000 yen?

104
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
1000 yen?

105
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Oh, look.

106
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
It's a radio.

107
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Look at this.

108
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Look at this.

109
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Look at this.

110
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Huh?

111
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Wait a minute.

112
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
It's on the radio.

113
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Huh?

114
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Look at this.

115
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
This is a joke.

116
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
He's doing it so it doesn't get dirty.

117
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
He's so kind.

118
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
He's so kind.

119
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
You're not supposed to be this kind in a punishment game.

120
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
It's a town before the end of the week.

121
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
It's gone.

122
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Maybe it's on the back.

123
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
The tires.

124
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:32,280
I'll take care of the

125
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I'll take care of the

126
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
How is it?

127
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Is there anything?

128
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Is there anything?

129
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
It's a big one.

130
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
What?

131
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
What?

132
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Wow! It's ringing!

133
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
It's a Shumai tree!

134
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Shumai tree rings!

135
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
It's ringing!

136
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
It's like a Shumai hunt

137
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
It's nice

138
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
This doesn't have a cover

139
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
It's not a cover

140
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
It's a standard

141
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
It's a cover

142
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
It's good that it's not raining today

143
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
It's good

144
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Let's look for it.

145
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
What?

146
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
A girl's cell phone strap?

147
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Hey!

148
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Oh, a strap.

149
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:35,320
If it's not a

150
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,320
Thank you!

151
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,320
Look at my friends!

152
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,320
There's a lot of them!

153
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,320
There's a lot of them!

154
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,320
You wouldn't ask me, would you?

155
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,320
Where did you buy them?

156
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,320
This is quite a lot.

157
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,320
I've already eaten 20 of them.

158
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:57,320
If we were going to do a penalty game, we wouldn't do this kind of thing yet.

159
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,320
We've only just started!

160
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,320
It's only the beginning!

161
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,320
It's nothing yet.

162
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,320
I don't like the toilet

163
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,320
I don't like the toilet

164
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,320
I don't like it

165
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,320
It's a pretty bad place

166
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,320
You have to look carefully

167
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,320
Yes

168
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,320
Where is it?

169
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,320
It's gone

170
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,320
I was surprised

171
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,320
There are so many

172
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,320
There are 6

173
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,320
I have never eaten it before

174
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,320
I can eat it with my hands

175
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,320
It's amazing

176
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:35,320
There are people who are walking dogs, but they are not.

177
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:38,320
There are many children, so if you find them, you will be eaten.

178
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,320
As expected, Mr. Vacuum.

179
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,320
I will go ahead.

180
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,320
It's late.

181
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,320
Let's go, Mr. Vacuum.

182
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,320
Let's go slowly.

183
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:51,320
Vacuum Fujiwara comes here and slows down as soon as possible.

184
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,320
The meat is cold and hard.

185
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,320
I don't know.

186
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,320
It's a punishment.

187
00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:00,320
Ignoring such an excuse, he goes to the residential area.

188
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:04,320
I'm sure you'll eat Shumai tomorrow, right?

189
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,320
That's right!

190
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,320
You said you ate it!

191
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,320
I came here to look for it.

192
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,320
That's right.

193
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,320
This is the place.

194
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,320
It's not that kind of park.

195
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,320
That's...

196
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,320
That's nice.

197
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,320
Shumai.

198
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,320
Shumai is delicious.

199
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,320
Shumai!

200
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,320
You're touching it a lot.

201
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,320
I'm touching it.

202
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,320
You're touching it a lot.

203
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,320
You're touching it a lot.

204
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,320
Shumai instead of rice.

205
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:29,320
Go away!

206
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,320
He's getting angry!

207
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,320
He's touching a lot!

208
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,320
But I don't know if it's good or not

209
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,320
It's a red wine from Furiya

210
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,320
It's here

211
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,320
What will it taste like?

212
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,320
Oh, this is good

213
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,320
It's good

214
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,320
There are so many Shumai in the city

215
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,320
Yes, there are

216
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:51,320
The factory

217
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,320
What should we do if it's a Shumai factory?

218
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,320
Shumai factory

219
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,320
There are so many

220
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:00,820
Mr. Bagumi, you're not talking much.

221
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:01,620
Really?

222
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:03,220
I think it's still going on.

223
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:04,020
Really?

224
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:05,520
I don't use the app at all.

225
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,220
Huh?

226
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:10,120
Huh?

227
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,420
Cute.

228
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:14,420
I love puzzles.

229
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:15,120
Look.

230
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,120
He's playing with a dog.

231
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,120
Look.

232
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,120
He's a child.

233
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,520
Look at this.

234
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,520
Oh!

235
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,520
Oh!

236
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,020
Hurry up.

237
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:29,020
Why did you step on my head at that timing?

238
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:32,020
You're slow!

239
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:35,020
You're slow!

240
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:37,020
You're not lucky at all!

241
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:40,020
You walked so calmly, why did you do that at that timing?

242
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,020
You're slow!

243
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:45,020
You almost got eaten!

244
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:49,020
When you're on Pau's head, you don't look so far away.

245
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:52,020
Somewhere...

246
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:54,020
I found something.

247
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:56,020
Thank you.

248
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:58,020
Which one is this?

249
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:00,020
Which one is this?

250
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:02,020
Is this a person from the hell of Shumai?

251
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:04,020
But you are from the hell of Shumai.

252
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:06,020
But it's Shumai.

253
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:08,020
It's okay.

254
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:10,020
It's delicious.

255
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:12,020
If you do that, it's dangerous.

256
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:14,020
You should eat it quickly.

257
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:16,020
It's dangerous.

258
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:18,020
I don't like it.

259
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:20,020
Eat it outside.

260
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:20,940
Is there anything else you won't eat?

261
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:44,160
Nothing, we're fine with bread

262
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,160
That's a pretty good one.

263
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:51,160
The 32 Shumai have been sucked up by the vacuum Fujiwara.

264
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:54,160
After this, the hell of Shumai will attack.

265
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,160
Tokoshi Ginza.

266
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:01,160
Tokoshi Ginza is famous.

267
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:04,160
Here, they enter the shopping street.

268
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:10,160
Vacuum Fujiwara already feels satisfied, but the real battle of Shumai hell begins.

269
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:16,160
We have Shumai, but Mr. Hamada, do you want to eat?

270
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,160
Is that okay?

271
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:26,160
Seeing Shumai, the hungry one decided to satisfy his hunger at the restaurant

272
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,160
Then curry

273
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,160
Thank you

274
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,160
Three curries

275
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,160
Then everyone will have curry

276
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:35,160
I'll have pork ginger set meal

277
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,160
You don't know

278
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:38,660
What?

279
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:40,160
I want to change the taste.

280
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,160
No, you can't change the taste.

281
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,160
It's a hell of a world.

282
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:43,660
You can eat a lot.

283
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:45,160
No matter what I think, I'm enjoying it.

284
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,160
You can eat a lot.

285
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,160
How many eggs are there?

286
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,160
There are still 20.

287
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,160
There are about 8.

288
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,160
Let's eat more.

289
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,160
Oh, stop it.

290
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,160
It's a good place to eat.

291
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,160
You can drink tea.

292
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,160
You can drink tea.

293
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,160
You can drink tea.

294
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,160
Thank you.

295
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,160
I'll go again soon.

296
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,160
It's in the tea shop.

297
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,160
Do you need a towel?

298
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:12,160
You have a lot of hair!

299
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,160
You should have told me earlier.

300
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,160
I have a lot of hair.

301
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,160
I got it.

302
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,160
You're wearing a lot of clothes.

303
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,160
Wow.

304
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,160
I'm going to eat.

305
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,160
I'm hungry.

306
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,160
I'm hungry.

307
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,160
I'm hungry.

308
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,160
Oh, oh, oh.

309
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,160
I'm going to eat.

310
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,160
Let's just put this in.

311
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,160
It's a topping.

312
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,160
Why did you put curry in?

313
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,160
I put curry!

314
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,160
It's your curry.

315
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,160
It's your curry.

316
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,160
It's a special dish.

317
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,160
I'll eat it.

318
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,160
I'm glad it's rice.

319
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,160
I'm glad it's rice.

320
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,160
It's a restaurant system.

321
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,160
Let's eat little by little.

322
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:07,160
This is so warm.

323
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,160
Why wasn't it warm until now?

324
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,160
It was all cold.

325
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,160
Let's eat.

326
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,160
What about udon?

327
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,160
Give me udon.

328
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:19,160
Ah!

329
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,160
I'm so scared.

330
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,160
It's 5 o'clock.

331
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,160
We came at this time.

332
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,160
That clock...

333
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,160
It's a bit late.

334
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:35,160
It's okay if it's 10 minutes late.

335
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,160
Ah, it's just 5 minutes.

336
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,160
Can I go to the toilet?

337
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,160
Why?

338
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,160
Can I go with you?

339
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:48,160
Why are you so free in this punishment game?

340
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:57,160
What is he?

341
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,160
It's not like a vacuum at all!

342
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,440
So he's not running away, is he?

343
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,440
Well, he's not running away that easily.

344
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,440
From here, to the toilet...

345
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,720
What happened?

346
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,720
I just went to the toilet.

347
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,720
The nose!

348
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,720
His nose is a little...

349
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,720
His nose is a little...

350
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,720
From the TV.

351
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:27,720
The restaurant is so good!

352
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,720
It's so good!

353
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:33,720
Why did you eat so much after going to the toilet?

354
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,720
Because I moved a little.

355
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:42,720
After clearing the restaurant, he goes to the shopping street where he can eat Shumai again.

356
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,720
Excuse me.

357
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:54,720
Excuse me, Mr. Pacquiao, I'm sorry, but I have to take this.

358
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,720
I made this for you, so please eat it.

359
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:59,720
Good luck!

360
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,720
Thank you.

361
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,720
It's important to be worried.

362
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:06,720
I wonder if he knows that he's being supported by anxiety.

363
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:11,720
You'll have a hard time with Shumai.

364
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:12,720
That's right.

365
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,720
Oh, oh, oh!

366
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,720
It's a Shumai!

367
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,720
It's a grilled Shumai!

368
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,720
Isn't this Mr. Kiyoku?

369
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,720
I always see him on TV!

370
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,720
This is a freebie!

371
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,720
It's a freebie!

372
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,720
It's a freebie!

373
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,720
It's supported by everyone in the world!

374
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,720
That's great!

375
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,720
Thank you!

376
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,720
Oh, there's more!

377
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,720
It's freebie!

378
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,720
Thank you for the phone call!

379
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,720
I can't believe it!

380
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,720
What's going on?

381
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,720
What's going on?

382
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:52,720
Yes, that's right.

383
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,720
That's right.

384
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,720
That's right.

385
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,720
We still have a lot of money left.

386
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,720
I'm selling shumai on the street.

387
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,720
Look at all the earrings.

388
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,720
Yes, yes, yes.

389
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,720
That's right.

390
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,720
Still, still, still

391
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,720
There are ears, ears

392
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,720
Both ears, both ears

393
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,720
Look at the ears, the ears

394
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,720
Both ears, yes yes yes

395
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,720
Yes yes yes

396
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,720
The other one, the other one

397
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,720
The way of eating

398
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,720
Good, good

399
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,720
There it is

400
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,720
Fujiwara, you're holding it in your hand, hurry up and eat it

401
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:32,720
If not, you won't be able to move on to the next stage

402
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,720
It's coming, you have to eat it

403
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,720
Then stop here. Don't move until I finish eating.

404
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,720
I see.

405
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:43,720
He stops here to suck up all the shumai he has.

406
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,720
What? Are you laughing?

407
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:48,720
Are you laughing?

408
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,720
You have a delicate face.

409
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:54,720
I'm jealous. I want to eat a lot of shumai.

410
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,720
Shumai is good.

411
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,720
I can't eat shumai at all today.

412
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,720
It looks delicious.

413
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,720
No, because I can't eat it.

414
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,720
It's the same thing as the vacuum cleaner.

415
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,720
It's not working at all.

416
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,720
Please.

417
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,720
It's a million times bigger.

418
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,720
Okay.

419
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,720
I'll do it.

420
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,720
I'll do it.

421
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,720
You're not a headache.

422
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,720
It's a lot.

423
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:24,720
That's right.

424
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,720
With that momentum.

425
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,720
I'll do it.

426
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,720
I'll do it.

427
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,720
I can do it.

428
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,720
Okay.

429
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,720
Okay.

430
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,720
The person who has eaten 81 Shumai so far is Bakium Fukumara.

431
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,720
But there is another challenge.

432
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,720
Yes.

433
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,720
Excuse me.

434
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,720
Are you Mr. Bakium?

435
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,720
No, I'm not.

436
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,720
No, I'm not.

437
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,720
No, I'm not.

438
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,720
I'm a fan of your show.

439
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,720
Please give me your autograph.

440
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,720
You're not allowed to do that.

441
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,720
I'm happy.

442
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,720
I'm happy.

443
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:54,720
Please.

444
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,720
Please.

445
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:56,720
Please.

446
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,720
You're a good person.

447
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,720
I'm angry.

448
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,720
I understand.

449
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,720
It's a good feeling.

450
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,720
It's a vacuum.

451
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,720
I've been stabbed a lot by a vacuum.

452
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,720
I'm not going to be noisy.

453
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,720
Thank you very much.

454
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,720
I'm sorry.

455
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,720
Please do your best.

456
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,720
I'm sorry.

457
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,720
I'm a big fan.

458
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,720
You're a big fan.

459
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,720
TV is amazing.

460
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,720
Thank you.

461
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:34,720
You are a big fan.

462
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,720
You are a big fan.

463
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:39,720
I'm sorry.

464
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,720
I'm sorry.

465
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,720
You are a big fan.

466
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:44,720
Don't cry.

467
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,720
Don't be stopped by someone.

468
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,720
I'm sorry.

469
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,720
I'm sorry.

470
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:50,720
Don't cry.

471
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,720
Don't cry.

472
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,720
I'm sorry.

473
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:54,720
Mr. Bakugou.

474
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,720
Please don't do that.

475
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,720
Finally, 1 in 3 of them are sitting down.

476
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,720
You're slow in terms of pace.

477
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,720
You're slow.

478
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,720
You're 1 in 3.

479
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,720
Hey!

480
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,720
Huh?

481
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,720
This is...

482
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,720
This is...

483
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:10,720
Isn't this Fujiwara-go?

484
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:11,720
This is Fujiwara-go's car.

485
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:12,720
This is Fujiwara's car.

486
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,720
This is Fujiwara's car.

487
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,720
Fujiwara, you're driving a Volvo.

488
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,720
This is really Fujiwara's car.

489
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:18,720
Right?

490
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,720
Wow!

491
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,720
What's wrong, Fujiwara?

492
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,720
What's this?

493
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,720
It's a dash board.

494
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,720
The color has changed.

495
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,720
That's right.

496
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,720
You're a great dash board.

497
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:30,720
Is that a Yankee?

498
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,720
That's right.

499
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,720
It's a Don Quixote.

500
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,720
Then, Fujiwara, you should get on.

501
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,720
I'll turn around.

502
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,720
Fujiwara, I'll wait for you.

503
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:40,720
You're amazing.

504
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,720
You're eating everything.

505
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,720
That must smell like shumai.

506
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,720
That's right.

507
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,720
You're so cruel.

508
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,720
He locked it.

509
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,720
He locked it.

510
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,720
Why did you lock it?

511
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,720
What kind of costume is that?

512
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,720
Jiro.

513
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,720
Don't ever take off your pants.

514
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,720
I can't help it.

515
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,720
I can't help it.

516
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:10,720
I can't help it.

517
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,020
We're only reacting to roughly the same weirdness.

518
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:16,020
Ladies and Juniors.

519
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,120
You are watching…

520
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:24,780
Long time no see, Tomoki.

521
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,180
This set one often leaves في

522
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,120
It does.

523
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,120
I share it often, in part.

524
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:41,120
I said a little bit of a joke on the radio, but I don't have a lot of sympathy for the audience, so I stopped on the way.

525
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:48,120
Where are the people who are talking on the phone at the convenience store?

526
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,120
Oh, you said that.

527
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:52,120
Look, the audience is like this again.

528
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:54,120
What is this?

529
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:57,120
Am I the only one who has seen the scene too much?

530
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:02,120
I'm the one who keeps talking in the convenience store next door.

531
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,120
But that's not true.

532
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:09,120
I've seen it, but I don't care.

533
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:13,120
It's okay if you put the product in the basket.

534
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:17,120
I'm talking while looking at it.

535
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,120
That's right.

536
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,120
Like a ha ha ha.

537
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:25,120
Of course, if you listen to the conversation, it's not that important.

538
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:28,120
I was like, I have to talk about it now!

539
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:31,120
I mean, I'm going to the convenience store!

540
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:36,120
There are products I want to see, but I want to get a Togari corn.

541
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:40,120
I was always in front of the Togari corn.

542
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:42,120
You were talking at the Togari corn?

543
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:47,120
There was a big convenience store the other day, and there were two guys like that.

544
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,120
Over here and over there.

545
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:54,120
I was like, if you guys become friends...

546
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,120
I'm talking to a different person.

547
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,120
But, no, I can't.

548
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,120
You're not really serious about it.

549
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,120
No, I'm not.

550
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:04,120
What are you saying?

551
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,120
For example, in the middle of winter,

552
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,120
That's definitely not good.

553
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,120
I can't make an excuse for that.

554
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:12,120
For example, in the middle of winter, it's really cold.

555
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:16,120
You're going to go into the convenience store and talk.

556
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,120
It's not like that.

557
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,120
It's this time of year.

558
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,120
You're talking all the time.

559
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:22,120
Anyway, you've been talking for five or ten minutes.

560
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:31,120
The other day, it was so bad, I thought he said it, but when I was listening to the conversation, it felt like my friend had died.

561
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,120
Oh, oh, oh.

562
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:35,120
And then, as expected, oh, oh, oh.

563
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,120
Ah, this is, well, it can't be helped.

564
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:41,120
Even so, it's even more out of reach.

565
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,120
It's not a good friend.

566
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,120
Hmm.

567
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,120
Ah, well, well, well.

568
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,120
But it can't be helped.

569
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,120
Somehow, after all, it's like this.

570
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,120
I'm convinced. I'm convinced.

571
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,120
I'm convinced. I'm convinced.

572
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:56,800
Well, everyone, well, Yamaguchi-san and other talent-san too,

573
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:01,120
they send e-mails and phone calls. You too, you know,

574
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,120
you do that.

575
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:08,120
I don't use any of the phone calls.

576
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:10,120
I don't do this.

577
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:13,120
What do you mean?

578
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,120
If that's the case, I'll give you 200 million yen.

579
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:19,120
I don't do that.

580
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:25,120
My phone is old but I can only send 300 emails.

581
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,120
Can you send more now?

582
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,120
I can send 500 more now.

583
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:33,120
The oldest one I saw was about March.

584
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,120
What?

585
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:36,120
The mail.

586
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,120
The mail?

587
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,120
Yes.

588
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,120
March?

589
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,120
Yes.

590
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:42,120
I have a lot of friends.

591
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:46,120
It's not gone.

592
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:48,120
It's gone, it's gone.

593
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:53,120
It's like, it's going to get colder.

594
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,120
Who said that?

595
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,120
Who said that?

596
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,120
You're going to laugh.

597
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,120
That's amazing.

598
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:06,120
That's true, but everyone uses their phones a lot.

599
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,120
You use your phone a lot.

600
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:13,120
I really have three batteries.

601
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,120
I think it's three.

602
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,120
It's three, right?

603
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,120
I've never seen it decrease.

604
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,120
One day?

605
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,120
But it's a charge-up disease.

606
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,120
I feel like it's decreasing.

607
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,120
I charged it right away.

608
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,120
You didn't hear it?

609
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,120
You didn't hear it?

610
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,120
It didn't decrease at all.

611
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,120
I've never had a beep.

612
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,120
I've never had a beep.

613
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,120
Hurry up to the convenience store.

614
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,120
You bought a 10-day vacation at a convenience store?

615
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,120
Not at all.

616
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:46,120
Not at all.

617
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,120
Ah, really?

618
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,120
If you go out for a day, you can afford it.

619
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,120
You can afford it.

620
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,120
You can afford it.

621
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:56,120
Sometimes, I forget my phone at home.

622
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,120
I think it's okay.

623
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:01,120
I work all day and when I get home,
