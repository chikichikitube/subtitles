1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Ladies and gentlemen.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Hello.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I haven't heard anything today, so I don't know what to do.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
What should I do?

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Today is the downtown special.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
It's our 10th anniversary this year.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
That's right.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
It's our 10th anniversary.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
You haven't done anything to us for the past 10 years.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
We've been suffering because of you.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
You don't know how painful it is, do you?

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
When Hamada stole gasoline.

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
When your job went wrong.

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
When someone lent you money.

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
When Hamada ran away with a woman in Tokyo.

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
It's been 10 years.

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Today, we have a guest.

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
For example, we'd like you to write a theme song for us.

19
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
For example, we'd like you to write a symbol for us.

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
For downtown, we'd like you to write a symbol for us.

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Do you have something like that?

22
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Bring it on.

23
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
You're in a good mood, aren't you?

24
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
If you say so, I'm in a good mood.

25
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
If you say so, I'm in a good mood.

26
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
If you say so, I'm in a good mood.

27
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
We'd like you to make such a song.

28
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Let's have you as a special guest.

29
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
You ate curry, didn't you?

30
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I don't know what you ate.

31
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I know you ate curry.

32
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I don't know what you ate.

33
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
This program is brought to you directly from Japan.

34
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
This program is brought to you directly from Japan.

35
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Let's start with our theme song.

36
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:34,000
This guest is a representative Japanese artist born in Kansai.

37
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
That's right.

38
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
This is the person who will make our theme song.

39
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
This is the person who will make our theme song.

40
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Thank you very much.

41
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
It's been a long time.

42
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
It's been a long time.

43
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Something's changed, hasn't it?

44
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I didn't know it at first.

45
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
We've skipped some songs, haven't we?

46
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
We've skipped some songs, haven't we?

47
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Yang Jin's song.

48
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Yukie Yukie Kawaguchi.

49
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
What else?

50
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
What else?

51
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
There are many more.

52
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
The next song is Aho ga miru buta no ke.

53
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Aho ga miru?

54
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Aho ga miru?

55
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
The next song is Aho ga miru?

56
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I don't think you know this.

57
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Aishu no kuro chikubi.

58
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
You don't know this, do you?

59
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
We didn't sell this at all.

60
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
We made a new song.

61
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Oh, Aishu no Kuroshikubi.

62
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
After that, Yukai na Mokkori.

63
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
This one didn't sell at all.

64
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Oh, the one that's a bit like Shimo.

65
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
The one that's a bit like Shimo.

66
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
This time, Tanba de Lumba.

67
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Oh, that's the one.

68
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I know that one.

69
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I know that one.

70
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
After that, Shoshimi.

71
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Oh, I know that one.

72
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Oh, with Omura-san.

73
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
This summer, I've been changing my own cymbals.

74
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
What song was that again?

75
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
It's called Yatte Misou.

76
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
It's called Yatte Misou.

77
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
It's still the same.

78
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
The title of your song is still the same.

79
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Yukkei-Ikkei Kawabuchi Hiroji.

80
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Yukkei, Yukkei, it's still the same!

81
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I see.

82
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
We're done.

83
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
That was a problem.

84
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
How many songs have we made?

85
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
You mean songs?

86
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
If you include this song, it won't be enough for 2,000 yen or 3,000 yen.

87
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
It will end in about 2 seconds.

88
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
There are a lot of fast songs, right?

89
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
There are a lot of fast songs.

90
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
It will end in a little while, right?

91
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
That's right.

92
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
That's why...

93
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Fast?

94
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
That's right.

95
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
We want to hear that.

96
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
That's right.

97
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
A theme song.

98
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
And then...

99
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
We talked about it a long time ago.

100
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I sent you a lot of materials.

101
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I asked you what kind of song you wanted to sing.

102
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
When I saw the materials you sent me,

103
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I saw that all of them were written by Matsumoto.

104
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
It seems that you are crazy.

105
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Especially Matsumoto.

106
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
This guy is crazy.

107
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Idiot.

108
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I'm not crazy.

109
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I'm not crazy.

110
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Stop it.

111
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I'm not crazy.

112
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Wait a minute.

113
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Stop talking like that even when you're older.

114
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
To be honest,

115
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I don't know why I'm not crazy.

116
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
You idiot.

117
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
You don't know why you're not crazy?

118
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Well, that's true.

119
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I'm not crazy.

120
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Shall we go?

121
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Well...

122
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Let's see how you went until you got there.

123
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
It's downtown, so I'll start with a fast song.

124
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
It's hard to write down.

125
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I'm not good at singing fast songs.

126
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I'm not good at singing fast songs.

127
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I have a song called Downtown by Eppo.

128
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
You have?

129
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
It's called Downtown.

130
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
It's cool.

131
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Hey!

132
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I thought it was a bit straight.

133
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
We used to sing that song in front of people.

134
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Is that right?

135
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Yes.

136
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I thought about it a lot.

137
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
It took a long time to make this song.

138
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
You said you wanted to make it earlier.

139
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
You said you wanted to make it earlier.

140
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
If you really like this song,

141
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
and you want me to use it,

142
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
what will happen to the money?

143
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
How much do you charge?

144
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
What?

145
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
For example, if you write one or two songs.

146
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I'll get paid for that.

147
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
It depends on how much it sells.

148
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Oh, I see.

149
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
It depends on how much it sells.

150
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I sometimes get asked to write a song for someone.

151
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I don't write that much,

152
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
but I still make Kitaro's albums.

153
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
If you ask me to write a song, I'll do it.

154
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
That's a lot.

155
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
The theme of Kitaro is Yoshi Ikuzo.

156
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
That's right.

157
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
So, what am I supposed to do?

158
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Please give me a moment.

159
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
But I don't have a angle to do that.

160
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Kitaro and a moment.

161
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
There are many.

162
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
The theme of Sunakage Baba.

163
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I request songs by Hekome Musume.

164
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
They're my albums.

165
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I'll give you a moment.

166
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I can make a song for a moment,

167
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
but I don't know much about it.

168
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
You want to know the data of a moment.

169
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
If you ask me to send you the data,

170
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I want to send you Yokai Daihyakka.

171
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
If you look at that,

172
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
One feature of Momen is it is soft,

173
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
the other is soft,

174
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
so When you're bad, even if you break into the water

175
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
it will return, there's only 3 features

176
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I have to work on 2 choirs with only 3

177
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
1 train version...

178
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
1 more Doctor Momen

179
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
But it's good, isn't it?

180
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
It's like a water-splash.

181
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
You're a fool!

182
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
You're a fool!

183
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I can't get used to it.

184
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
It's fun, isn't it?

185
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Have we made it yet?

186
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
The part we've known for a long time,

187
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
the old downtown and the present downtown,

188
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
we'll divide it into two parts.

189
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
The first one is the old downtown in Osaka.

190
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
It's a mess now, but there was a hard time,

191
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
including the past.

192
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
The second one is the present.

193
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
It's like a girl who was born in Osaka.

194
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
It's a song of a girl who was born in Osaka.

195
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
What?

196
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
It's a song of a girl who was born in Osaka.

197
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
What?

198
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
The title is the downtown born in Yoshimoto.

199
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I see.

200
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Can you tell us?

201
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Shall we listen to it?

202
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
That's right, but I'd like to hear the other songs of Kamo.

203
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
That's right.

204
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I'll leave it for later.

205
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Is it okay to sing it at the end?

206
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Shall we sing?

207
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
It's a song of a recent place.

208
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Thank you.

209
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
The old downtown is a mess now.

210
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
You're too fast!

211
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I'm an old man who can't move anymore.

212
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
It's snowing.

213
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Are you ready?

214
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I'm getting wet in the rain.

215
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I'm changing my clothes.

216
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,000
There's konjac coming out of my nose.

217
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I can't leave you, I can't let you go.

218
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
You gave it to me.

219
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Kirinji, Saka, Hokuhoku, Tenyu.

220
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I loved you, but I didn't know Hanako was there.

221
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Four, six, twenty, four, four, seven, twenty-eight.

222
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Four is thirty-two, four is thirty-six.

223
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Namihei got on the boat and made Sazae.

224
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
There's a lot of things.

225
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
It's delicious.

226
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
It's delicious.

227
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
The last one is the best.

228
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Let's play downtown.

229
00:09:53,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Let's play downtown, which was born in Yoshimoto.

230
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I'm tired of talking.

231
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Our laughter is not like this.

232
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I thought I lost while looking at the popularity of Tomizu.

233
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I'm crying.

234
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Downtown Yasakai was born in Yoshimoto.

235
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I can't go to the theater on the 20th.

236
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Downtown Yasakai was born in Yoshimoto.

237
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I can't sleep.

238
00:10:48,000 --> 00:11:01,000
When the second half of the show was a boom, the company's attitude changed.

239
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Number two.

240
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:09,000
The second half of the show was a peak.

241
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:15,000
The company told me to go to Tokyo.

242
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Keishu, who shatters in front of my eyes, fell in a flash.

243
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
It's well done.

244
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I can't believe I thought of it at school.

245
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
It's wonderful.

246
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Everyone, Keishu and Tomizu came out.

247
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I'm a little bit of a maniac.

248
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I'm a little bit of a maniac.

249
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I'm a little bit of a maniac.

250
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I don't think I'm a maniac.

251
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Keishu did his best in Tokyo.

252
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
It was faster to go to Tokyo than Downtown.

253
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Yoshimoto is also strong.

254
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,000
All Night Nippon suddenly became popular.

255
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
It's not funny at all.

256
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Keishu disappeared from Tokyo.

257
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
It disappeared in Osaka.

258
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Let's think about our catchphrase.

259
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
We have another guest.

260
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Let's call him.

261
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:27,000
This person.

262
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Mr. Asakuraku Shino.

263
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Nice to meet you.

264
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Nice to meet you.

265
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
It's like a killer's shoe.

266
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
It's okay.

267
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
When my staff went to ask for it,

268
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I thought it would be rejected.

269
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Did you throw it away?

270
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
That's not good.

271
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
It's okay.

272
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
What do you say?

273
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
It's easy to do.

274
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Is that so?

275
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I didn't know until this afternoon.

276
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
What are you talking about?

277
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
But I'm glad you came.

278
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Do you know the program called I don't know?

279
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
What is it?

280
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I haven't told you yet.

281
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Do you know it?

282
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I read it in the article.

283
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
What is the pattern this time?

284
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,000
How did you twist it this time?

285
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
This time...

286
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
From home to here.

287
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
What is that?

288
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
But that's amazing.

289
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Excuse me.

290
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Did you wear underwear?

291
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
It stinks.

292
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Idiot.

293
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
From behind.

294
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I didn't do it.

295
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
How many did you think today?

296
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I'm a little embarrassed.

297
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Really?

298
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Three.

299
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Really?

300
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Let's use the best one.

301
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I don't know if it's good.

302
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
What is the first one?

303
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:14,000
The first one is delicate like a demon and bold like an angel.

304
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I see.

305
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
The devil is bold and the angel is...

306
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
What is it?

307
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
It's different.

308
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:30,000
It's a technique to show the opposite.

309
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I'm really sorry, but don't you think it's wrong?

310
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I'm not good at writing.

311
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Isn't it wrong?

312
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Isn't it weird to write bold?

313
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I've been checking it.

314
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I'm sorry if I made a mistake.

315
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
No, you're wrong.

316
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I'm sorry.

317
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Do you mind if I hit you?

318
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
The next one is...

319
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
The more I think about it, the more I feel at ease.

320
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:09,000
The more I think about it, the more I feel at ease.

321
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I think the first one is better.

322
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Even if you make a mistake?

323
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Even if I make a mistake.

324
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
That's fine.

325
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
There's one more.

326
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
It's...

327
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Anti-trendy, anti-degadance, not light, not heavy, a little sweet and bitter downtown.

328
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Which one is a little sweet?

329
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
That's...

330
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Even if you ask me...

331
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Both of you are handsome, so sweet? Mask?

332
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Is it wrong?

333
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
No, no.

334
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
It's bitter.

335
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
You bite little by little.

336
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
No, no, no.

337
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
It's bitter.

338
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,000
It's not a catch copy.

339
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
What are you going to do if you get angry?

340
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I see.

341
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
These three.

342
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I think the first one is the best.

343
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Really?

344
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Yes.

345
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
When do you use this?

346
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Catch copy.

347
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
What?

348
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
When do you use the catch copy?

349
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
When it came out.

350
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:20,000
In the past, Mr. Katsura said, Margaret on the window, Mr. Katsura.

351
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
It's not like that at all.

352
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
He said that.

353
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Right?

354
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Yes.

355
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Mr. Katsura said that.

356
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Mr. Katsura said that.

357
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,000
When it came out, he said that.

358
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
The first one.

359
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Margaret on the window and Mr. Katsura.

360
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I can say it quickly, but that's long.

361
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I can't say the third one.

362
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I can't say it.

363
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Excuse me.

364
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I can't say it.

365
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
They came out together.

366
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Anti-trendy, anti-degadance.

367
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
It's not light, it's not heavy.

368
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,000
It's a little sweet and bitter.

369
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
When it comes out with this guy, it's complicated.

370
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Why is it complicated?

371
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
There's something like this.

372
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
The devil is talking about this guy.

373
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Why?

374
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
That's true.

375
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Why?

376
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
My face is serious, isn't it?

377
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
It's true.

378
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
The devil is talking about you.

379
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
The angel is talking about me.

380
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
You can say that yourself.

381
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
That's right.

382
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
What is this?

383
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
It's okay.

384
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I like this one better.

385
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
It's more comfortable than I thought.

386
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I like this one better.

387
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I got three of these, but I don't like any of them.

388
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
When I thought about this, I couldn't stand it anymore.

389
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I like this one as a word.

390
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I like this one better.

391
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I like this one better.

392
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I like this one better.

393
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I like this one better.

394
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
If I put this in my mouth, I can talk with it.

395
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Then, this one.

396
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
I'll release a CD next time, so I'll go get it.

397
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
It's too late.

398
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
It's too late.

399
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:09,000
It's already in my mouth.

400
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,000
You don't know it until you get it.

401
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Shina-san, put this in your mouth. Let's do it with three people.

402
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I'm pushing this one.

403
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Shina-san, you push this one.

404
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Let's do rock-paper-scissors with three people.

405
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Let's decide who wins.

406
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Rock-paper-scissors.

407
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I won.

408
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Thank you.

409
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
How much is this?

410
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
How much is this?

411
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
What is this?

412
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
This is the price.

413
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
You can't use this without permission, can you?

414
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Please use it without permission.

415
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I don't like this.

416
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Is it okay?

417
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Please.

418
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I don't feel good.

419
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
How much do you want?

420
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
How much do you want?

421
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Ask me after a while.

422
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
How much do you want?

423
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
How much do you want?

424
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
How much do you want?

425
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I don't know how much you want.

426
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,000
You are making Osaka people your enemies.

427
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:21,000
How much do you want?

428
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Next.

429
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Yes.

430
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Our Mars.

431
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I wonder if we can do it.

432
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
This is what I'm talking about.

433
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
We're going to make something on the show.

434
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
We made a G-jan before.

435
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
There was a staff.

436
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
There might be a T-shirt in the summer.

437
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
At that time.

438
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
We're going to put it in.

439
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
We're going to make it for that.

440
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Let's introduce that person.

441
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
It's Kazuhiko Hideto.

442
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Hello.

443
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
This is Macaro.

444
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
You've changed a lot.

445
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Once in Nagoya.

446
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
We were doing a talk show in Nagoya.

447
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
You came once at that time.

448
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Yes.

449
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I think I was more stupid than I was then.

450
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
That was about three or four years ago.

451
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
That's right.

452
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
In Nagoya.

453
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
The head of the commercial is worse.

454
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
The head of the commercial is more dreadful around here.

455
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I don't know if it's dreadful now.

456
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,000
It's been about three or four years since then.

457
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
At that time, on our show.

458
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
This person is amazing.

459
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
He has power.

460
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
I asked him to put a mark on it.

461
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
It's like a chainsaw.

462
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
I cut the set.

463
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
I asked him at the end.

464
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
What do you want to do in the future?

465
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
What did you say?

466
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:50,000
I want to hurt the earth.

467
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
That's a cool word.

468
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
I want to hurt it.

469
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
How about that?

470
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
I've done it a little bit in Sendai.

471
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
It's like this.

472
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
It's like this as a scar.

473
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
What's going on these days?

474
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
It seems to be on TV.

475
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
That's right.

476
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
You don't hate it, do you?

477
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I don't hate it.

478
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I don't like that I can't fight without a picture, a brush, and a paper.

479
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
I see.

480
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Even if I don't have anything, I want to do something.

481
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
What do you think of yourself?

482
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:33,000
When you go out, do you think you're the type to be pulled by a brush?

483
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Or do you think you're the type to be pulled by a chair?

484
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
I don't think so.

485
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
It's a little bit more than this head.

486
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:46,000
If it was a long time ago, I think it would be funny.

487
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
What's this head?

488
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
It's like this.

489
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,000
You think I'm stupid, don't you?

490
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I don't care because you're doing it.

491
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,000
I don't think I'm stupid, but I think I'm stupid.

492
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Your head is tough.

493
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Do you sell this kind of clothes?

494
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
I don't sell it.

495
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
What did you do?

496
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I don't have a single piece made.

497
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Do you say that yourself?

498
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:22,000
There are people who always make clothes like this.

499
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
You can't wear this kind of clothes, can you?

500
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
I don't have any left.

501
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Everyone is scared.

502
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,000
If you have this kind of head, you have to have this kind of past.

503
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
You can't get a relationship.

504
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,000
I just happened to have a head that I thought would be valuable.

505
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,000
What are you talking about?

506
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,000
It was pretty hard.

507
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I was easily attracted to it.

508
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Was it hard?

509
00:22:53,000 --> 00:23:00,000
I often do trademarks at work.

510
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
What kind of things have you done so far?

511
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
There are many stores.

512
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:14,000
If you go to a store with a logo, it looks like this.

513
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:19,000
It looks like a store.

514
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,000
But this doesn't look like downtown.

515
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:31,000
What doesn't look like downtown?

516
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:36,000
This doesn't look like a normal restaurant.

517
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,000
This doesn't look like that.

518
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
There are various variations.

519
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:51,000
For example, this kind of thing.

520
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
That's great.

521
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,000
You are amazing, Mr. Hibino.

522
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:10,000
This is like this.

523
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:17,000
This is like this.

524
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Who is writing a stone?

525
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:28,000
For example, there is a person who is down.

526
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:33,000
This is downtown.

527
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
This is a building.

528
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
This is a person who is down.

529
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
This is good for a T-shirt.

530
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
This too.

531
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
This is a back print.

532
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,000
This is really good.

533
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,000
If there is such a game,

534
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:04,000
For example, it is good to mark the characters of two people.

535
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,000
I think it would be nice if I could omit it.

536
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
I write a lot.

537
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
I write Machan and Hamachan.

538
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
This is Hamada.

539
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:21,000
I write a lot and then I use a pen.

540
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
I think it looks like this.

541
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,000
It's a little thicker than I thought.

542
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Then the expression comes out.

543
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
I took it out of here and expanded it.

544
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:38,000
This is cool.

545
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
I understand this.

546
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,000
What does this mean that the back is brown?

547
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,000
The image we have is brown.

548
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
I made it brown because I liked it.

549
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
This is good.

550
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:57,000
But this is also good.

551
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,000
This is very difficult.

552
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:05,000
If you want to make it look like a wakuten,

553
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:09,000
You can use this in some form.

554
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:14,000
I will use this as it is.

555
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Why?

556
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Can I use all of this?

557
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
You can.

558
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,000
But I have to pay for it.

559
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:30,000
If I use this and this at the same price,

560
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
I'm a little angry.

561
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:37,000
This is Hibino.

562
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:42,000
But if you use it,

563
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
It takes some time.

564
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
That's right.

565
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Isn't it 300,000 yen?

566
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
It's a little cheap.

567
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Let's use three.

568
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Let's use three.

569
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
I don't know if it's similar.

570
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Of course.

571
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:03,000
I don't say much about money on TV.

572
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,000
I don't say much.

573
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Do you listen to it?

574
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Then we will create our own song.

575
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
This person.

576
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
He made this song.

577
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
This person.

578
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Today's guest.

579
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Next guest.

580
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Please welcome.

581
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Mr.Ozaki Ami.

582
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Nice to meet you.

583
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Nice to meet you too.

584
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
I can't bow to you.

585
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
It's all right.

586
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Don't be surprised.

587
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Don't be surprised.

588
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Don't be surprised.

589
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
I'm not hitting anyone.

590
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
I'm a little scared.

591
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
I'm a little scared.

592
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Odaki, do you know us well?

593
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Of course.

594
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Of course.

595
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
When I asked you to make a song,

596
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
did you listen to it?

597
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Of course.

598
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
I like it.

599
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Really.

600
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
I was surprised.

601
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
You are a real hit maker.

602
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
You are a real hit maker.

603
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
I think so.

604
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
You wrote a song for someone else.

605
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
You wrote a song for someone else.

606
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
You wrote a song for someone else.

607
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
You wrote a song for someone else.

608
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
There are many songs.

609
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
There are many songs.

610
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
The one I remember the most is that.

611
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
My feelings.

612
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
That's a song you wrote yourself.

613
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
That's a song you wrote yourself.

614
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
I'm walking.

615
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
About 13 years ago.

616
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
How old were you then?

617
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
About 13 years ago?

618
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
About 13 years ago?

619
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
About 13 years ago?

620
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
About 13 years ago?

621
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
About 13 years ago?

622
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
About 13 years ago?

623
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
When I was a child.

624
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
You were always listening to songs?

625
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
When I was fourteen.

626
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
It doesn't matter.

627
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
I did it myself.

628
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
What?

629
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Why?

630
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
For instances like that.

631
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
For instance like that.

632
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Seeking for Bolivia.

633
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Seeking for Bolivia.

634
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
a girl when plays in Karaoke.

635
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
You can sing.

636
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Matsudaira Ken-san also wrote a song today.

637
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Is there a commercial song?

638
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Yes, there is a commercial song.

639
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
I just sang a commercial song.

640
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Kobayashi Asami-san was running.

641
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Is that so?

642
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
It was a song called My Fair Lady.

643
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Kobayashi Asami-san?

644
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Kobayashi Akira's song.

645
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
I'm really going to use this.

646
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Really?

647
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Will it be used?

648
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Well, I'll tell you later.

649
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
I don't know until I hear it.

650
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Hey!

651
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Well, even if you say that, it's a miss.

652
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
It's the second image.

653
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Really?

654
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Yes.

655
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Hey!

656
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Ozaki!

657
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
How long did it take to make it?

658
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
The time to make it?

659
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
This came out almost immediately.

660
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
You're not putting in any effort.

661
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
I have an image of downtown.

662
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
I'm from Kansai.

663
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
I'm from Kyoto.

664
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
In Kansai,

665
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
there's always a strange boy.

666
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Isn't there?

667
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
No, there is.

668
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
I'm being teased.

669
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
But it's so much fun.

670
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
It's really interesting.

671
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
I wonder if this person is okay with Jiro.

672
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
It's like that.

673
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Also,

674
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
the sound of the fire crackling.

675
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Also,

676
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
the sound of everyone shouting

677
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
in front of the club room.

678
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Also, the smell of the shoe box.

679
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
When I say smell, it's smelly.

680
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
It's like that.

681
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
I see.

682
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
I thought that I had to

683
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
make it dirty.

684
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Was it too clean?

685
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
No, it's not like that.

686
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
It's not supposed to be sunny.

687
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
It's like that.

688
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
When I was getting wet,

689
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
I didn't walk seriously.

690
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
My back was itchy.

691
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
I heard that.

692
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
I see.

693
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
It's okay.

694
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
It's okay.

695
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
What's your original character?

696
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
It's cold.

697
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
I have something heavy.

698
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
It's just like that.

699
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
I'm sorry.

700
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
What are you doing?

701
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Ozaki-san,

702
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
before you sing that song,

703
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
can you sing

704
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
while listening to Olivia?

705
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
I want to hear

706
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
your original song.

707
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Do you remember the lyrics?

708
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
I don't remember.

709
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Even if I step on

710
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
the pedal,

711
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
I can't step on it.

712
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
I can't step on it.

713
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
I can't step on it.

714
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
Who are you?

715
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Wait!

716
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Who are you?

717
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Who are you?

718
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
What are you doing?

719
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
The pianist

720
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
who brought the piano.

721
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
I don't know him at all.

722
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Can I start?

723
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Let's start.

724
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Ozaki!

725
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
I'm sorry.

726
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
One more time, please.

727
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:11,000
My favorite song

728
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:17,000
I'll listen to it alone.

729
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Olivia is a lonely heart

730
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Because she comforts me

731
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Jasmine tea is a drug that makes me sleep

732
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:49,000
I want to spend a day like me

733
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:55,000
On a night like this

734
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
When we met

735
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:07,000
I didn't think this day would come

736
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
We said

737
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Making up despair

738
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:19,000
No, we just spent time

739
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Exhausted

740
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:35,000
You, my illusion, I loved you

741
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:45,000
You, my illusion, I loved you

742
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:15,000
You, my illusion, I loved you

743
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Walking in the rain

744
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:50,000
As time goes by

745
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Walking in the rain

746
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:04,000
As time goes by

747
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Walking in the rain

748
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Walking in the rain

749
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:26,000
The smell of rain from the shoulders

750
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:32,000
The smell of after school from the back

751
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:40,000
The sound of closing the door on the sixth floor

752
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:47,000
The sound of laughing and whistling

753
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Where are you going while getting wet?

754
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:09,000
The honest back is melting

755
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Walking in the rain

756
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:23,000
As time goes by

757
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Walking in the rain

758
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Walking in the rain

759
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Talking in the rain

760
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Walking in the rain

761
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:23,000
As time goes by
