1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
In the first episode of Aki no Tsukai Arahen, aim for a prize of 300,000 yen!

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Aki no Uwaa Uwaa Sanbon Shobu!

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Everyone, it's already autumn, so we have to move our bodies

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Yes, it's the first month of the service

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Today, we have Madsonsu-san and Endo team

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Yes

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Yama-chan and Tanaka team

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Yes

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
The two teams, let's have a Sanbon Shobu

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
The winning team will receive a prize of 300,000 yen!

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
The losing team will lose

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
This program is brought to you by these sponsors

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Let's go round and round! Toilet paper!

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Haya-maki-tori-taiketsu!

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
It's easy

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Yes

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The team with the fastest start wins

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I see

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
With this

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm good at this

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Let's start

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Ready

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Ah, it's a flute

24
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
The flute is...

25
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Oharu Shoya

26
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Pa pa pa pa

27
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
It's just a game, you can just bring the flute

28
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
What's wrong?

29
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
What's wrong?

30
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Why are you so angry?

31
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
What's wrong?

32
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
It's not what you think

33
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
It's a flute

34
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The director of Gaki no Tsukai, Komura Saki Kozo

35
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
With his charming smile and unique character, he captivates everyone

36
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
He's a famous idiot

37
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Who is he?

38
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
A flute

39
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
A flute?

40
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I don't have a flute

41
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I didn't order it

42
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
You didn't order it? Why did you order it?

43
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I brought the flute by myself

44
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Who do you call a flute?

45
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
No, no, that's...

46
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I'm sorry to say this

47
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Why did you order it?

48
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I didn't bring it

49
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Who do you call a flute?

50
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
No, no, no

51
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I didn't bring it by myself

52
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
That's strange

53
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Who would bring a flute by himself?

54
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Did you bring it by yourself?

55
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I didn't bring it

56
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
What's wrong with you? How do you do this?

57
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
It's a good flute, so I can do it

58
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I want a flute, but I don't have money, so I can't buy it

59
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
How much is it?

60
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
How much is it?

61
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
You can buy a flute

62
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Don't you have anything?

63
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
What are you going to do?

64
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I can't do it without something

65
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I don't even know the price

66
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Okay, I got it

67
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Let's do this

68
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I'll do it

69
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
What?

70
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I'll do the flute

71
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I don't understand what you're saying

72
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I'll do the flute

73
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
What do you mean?

74
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I'll do the flute

75
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Let's do it

76
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
What are you going to do?

77
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Do it for me

78
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Do it for me

79
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
What?

80
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Stop it

81
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
What are you doing?

82
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Are you going to give it to me?

83
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Give it to me

84
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
What?

85
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Give it to me

86
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
That's a strange way of talking

87
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
It's a strange way of talking

88
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
What are you doing?

89
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
It's a strange way of talking

90
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
You have one minute

91
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Okay

92
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Let's go

93
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Okay

94
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Ready

95
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Wait a minute

96
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
What's wrong?

97
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Why are you laughing?

98
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
What?

99
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
It's him

100
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
It's not like that

101
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
It's not?

102
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I think you have to use your smile

103
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
What?

104
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
You have to use your smile

105
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I don't think that's a good thing

106
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Okay, let's do it

107
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I'll use my smile

108
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Let's do it

109
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Okay

110
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Ready

111
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Ready

112
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Ready

113
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Ready

114
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Ready

115
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Ready

116
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Ready

117
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Go

118
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Go

119
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
You're good

120
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
You're good

121
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
You're good

122
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
You're good

123
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
You're good

124
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
You're good

125
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
You're good

126
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
You can do it!

127
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
You can do it!

128
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
You can do it!

129
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
You can do it!

130
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Time's up!

131
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
It's over.

132
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
It's hard to tell.

133
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
It's hard to tell.

134
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
It's hard to tell.

135
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
It's hard to tell.

136
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
It's hard to tell.

137
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
It's hard to tell.

138
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
You don't know the answer.

139
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
You're just drawing.

140
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Just drawing.

141
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Bring it on.

142
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Bring it on.

143
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
OK, next game.

144
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
OK, next game.

145
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
If I do it now, I don't know.

146
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I don't know what this is

147
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
No-Ten-Kin-Kaki-Gori-Hayagui-Taiketsu!

148
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
This is the same

149
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
The time limit is 1 minute

150
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
How much can you eat?

151
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
It's going to be hard

152
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I'm going to say 5 words in front of everyone

153
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
How much can you eat?

154
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Come here, you're talking to me

155
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
How much can you eat?

156
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Hayagui-Taiketsu!

157
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Ready!

158
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Go, go, go!

159
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
This is hard

160
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Ouch, ouch, ouch!

161
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I know, I know

162
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Come on, hurry up

163
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Let's go, let's go

164
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Crush it, crush it

165
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
It's over!

166
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Did you see that?

167
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
What?

168
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
If you say it after someone says it, you'll know

169
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
But you said 1 minute, didn't you?

170
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
It's not going to be a match

171
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Then at least say it

172
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
That's impossible

173
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
It's hard to understand

174
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
It's the easiest to understand

175
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Then can you say it?

176
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I can say it

177
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
How do you say it?

178
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I say it like this

179
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
That's hard

180
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
It's hard

181
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I think it's hard to laugh

182
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
It's hard

183
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
It's not hard

184
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
It's not hard

185
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Are you laughing?

186
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Just a little

187
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Why?

188
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Why are you laughing?

189
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Bring it on

190
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
No, no, no

191
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
No, no, no

192
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
It's hard to understand

193
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
It's hard

194
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
It's hard

195
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
It's not hard

196
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
It's not hard

197
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Do you want to quit?

198
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I'll quit

199
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I'm getting goosebumps

200
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Don't laugh

201
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I don't understand

202
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I don't understand

203
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Crush it, fire badminton match

204
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Winner

205
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
So far it's draw and draw

206
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
It's a draw

207
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
The prize money is 30 yen

208
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
The one who gets 7 points wins

209
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
7 points

210
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Ready

211
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I got it

212
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Good

213
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I got it

214
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Good

215
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Which one?

216
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Which one?

217
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Which one?

218
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Did it go in?

219
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
It went in

220
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Which one did you get?

221
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Yama-chan team got 1 point

222
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
What?

223
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
You got it?

224
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I don't understand

225
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I don't understand

226
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Your voice is too small

227
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
That's fine

228
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Ready

229
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Don't laugh

230
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
What?

231
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Are you laughing?

232
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
What?

233
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Your voice is too small

234
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Stop laughing

235
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Ready

236
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I got it

237
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I got it

238
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I got it

239
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Good

240
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
No gan

241
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
If it's no gan, laugh

242
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
What are you doing?

243
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Can you see it?

244
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
It's starting

245
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
It's starting

246
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
It's starting

247
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
It's like...

248
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
It's like you're trying to make me laugh

249
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I can't do it

250
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
You're not going to do it

251
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
You're not going to do it

252
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
You have to set the character

253
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
You have to set the character

254
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Bring it up

255
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Bring it up

256
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Bring it up

257
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Bring it up

258
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Bring it up

259
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Bring it up

260
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
You're sweating

261
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Bring it up

262
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
At least change the hat

263
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Bring it up

264
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Seriously

265
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Bring a new hat

266
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Is this a new hat?

267
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Is it okay?

268
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
It's okay

269
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Really?

270
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
That's fine

271
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
It's 0

272
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
You have to be confident.

273
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
You're confident and you're going to send it, right?

274
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Yeah, I'm fine.

275
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Let's go.

276
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
This team first.

277
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Ready!

278
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
What are you doing?

279
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
It's too long.

280
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Why is it this side?

281
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Let's go.

282
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Good evening.

283
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
It's been a while.

284
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
It's been a while, right?

285
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Well...

286
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Road construction...

287
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Can I eat this?

288
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Road construction...

289
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
There's a road construction site, right?

290
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
They do this at night.

291
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
They do it like this.

292
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
When you're driving, they do it like this.

293
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
They do it like this.

294
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
They do it like this.

295
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I don't know where you started.

296
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
You can do it like this.

297
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
You can do it like this.

298
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:50,000
You should study more and make rules.

299
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I'm doing it properly.

300
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
You should study more and make rules.

301
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Well, well, well.

302
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I was driving at night.

303
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I had two cars.

304
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
You don't understand the meaning, do you?

305
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
No, no.

306
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
That's why I told you to stop.

307
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
No, that's not it.

308
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I was doing it like this.

309
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I was having fun.

310
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I stopped.

311
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I opened the window.

312
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I said, what are you doing?

313
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
The road is bumpy.

314
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I want you to slow down.

315
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Do you understand?

316
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I don't understand that.

317
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
It's different from the originality.

318
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I don't understand that.

319
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I don't understand that.

320
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I don't understand that.

321
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I thought you were angry.

322
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I thought you were angry.

323
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
What is it?

324
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
What is it?

325
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
The Japanese series will start.

326
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
The Japanese series will start on Saturday.

327
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Kakeoka.

328
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Which do you think it is?

329
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
That's a giant.

330
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Really?

331
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I'm a giant fan, so I have to cheer for the giant.

332
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
It's been a long time.

333
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
It's okay.

334
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Where are you?

335
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Where are you?

336
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Naturally.

337
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Well, then.

338
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I'm a giant.

339
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I'm not saying I'm a giant.

340
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I pretended to be a giant.

341
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I'm a giant fan.

342
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I don't care.

343
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I don't care.

344
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I don't care.

345
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I don't care.

346
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I don't care.

347
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I don't care.

348
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I don't care.

349
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I don't care.

350
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I don't care.

351
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I don't care.

352
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Kakeoka,wrote a line that makes you laugh.

353
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I re?

354
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
What's the matter?

355
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Why do yo say that?

356
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Why do yo say that?

357
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
It's fun.

358
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
You can't do it.

359
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
You have to cut the intrigue.

360
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
You have to cut the intrigue.

361
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I don't care.

362
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
You can use it as many times as you want.

363
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I mean, there's no one who can kick his partner's ass as much as he wants.

364
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
You're right.

365
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
What do you think, Son-dan?

366
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I don't think I can kick his ass.

367
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Oh, really?

368
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I don't think I can kick his ass.

369
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
But you can do it.

370
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Why?

371
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Because I still have to leave my wife.

372
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I have to protect her.

373
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Oh, I see.

374
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
You don't have anything left, right?

375
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I don't need it.

376
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Oh, really?

377
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I didn't know that.

378
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
You don't need it.

379
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I just remembered.

380
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
You forgot something.

381
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
You're weird.

382
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I don't need it.

383
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
You don't need it.

384
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Why do you need it?

385
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
What do you use it for?

386
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
You can use it to pee.

387
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Wait a minute.

388
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
How do you prove that you don't need it?

389
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
No, no.

390
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
That's just a hole.

391
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
A hole?

392
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Yes, a hole.

393
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I'll make two holes for you.

394
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I don't want to prove it.

395
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Just make one hole.

396
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Then I'll make a hole like this.

397
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Why?

398
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I'll give you some momentum.

399
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Like a rubber nozzle.

400
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Like this?

401
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
You don't need it, right?

402
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Why don't you need it?

403
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I'll cut it.

404
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Because you don't need it.

405
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
You don't need it.

406
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Your wife will be happy if you don't have it.

407
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Why?

408
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
You always make fun of me.

409
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
You don't need it.

410
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
You really don't need it.

411
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I don't need it.

412
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Go to Macao.

413
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
What?

414
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Go to Macao to cut it.

415
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Why Macao?

416
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
You go to Macao to cut it, right?

417
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
You're old.

418
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I made a wooden box.

419
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Why a wooden box?

420
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
It's not your belly.

421
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Do you put it in a wooden box?

422
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I put it in.

423
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Where do you put it?

424
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I put it in the trunk of my car.

425
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I said, there's no way.

426
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Who are you explaining it to?

427
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
There's no way.

428
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
When I became weak.

429
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Who?

430
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
You.

431
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
When you were in the car and became weak.

432
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
There's no way.

433
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Who are you explaining it to?

434
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
There's no way.

435
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Well, it's the police investigation.

436
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
When I got angry because I couldn't give it to you.

437
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
If you don't have it, it's a little...

438
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
It's like a fire.

439
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
You're an idiot.

440
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
It's okay.

441
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
There's no way.

442
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I'm still here.

443
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I'll do anesthesia.

444
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
So.

445
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
You should cut it.

446
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Why don't you cut it?

447
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I got it.

448
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
You think I'm going to cut it right away, don't you?

449
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
How do you cut it?

450
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
The pattern of the cut cheese.

451
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I made it a wave.

452
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
It's like a carrot.

453
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
How do you cut it?

454
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
The carrot next to the stage.

455
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I'll think about it.

456
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
What is this guy?

457
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
There are a lot of people I don't know these days.

458
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:31,000
A long time ago, there was a famous person who came out.

459
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
If you say that, something strange will come out.

460
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I think Bob Sapp will come out.

461
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
It's hard to have someone come out.

462
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,000
You have to laugh a little and return it.

463
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
That's true.

464
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
What's that?

465
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
You know.

466
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I'm doing what I want to ask you on the website.

467
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I'll send you an e-mail today.

468
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I see.

469
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
That's amazing.

470
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:17,000
There's a creature called the last chimp in the back of the mountain of fangs.

471
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Please tell me what it looks like.

472
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
This is scary.

473
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
I've never heard of it.

474
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
The last chimp.

475
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
This is scary.

476
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Please tell me what it looks like.

477
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,000
It's the last one.

478
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
It used to be a flock.

479
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
It's about to disappear.

480
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I see.

481
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
It's amazing.

482
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Please tell me what it looks like.

483
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
It's wearing a skirt.

484
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
It's wearing a skirt.

485
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
The whole body is dirty.

486
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Which one?

487
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Which one do you want to ask?

488
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
A creature?

489
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
It's a human.

490
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
It's wearing a skirt.

491
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
It doesn't have hands.

492
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
On its shoulders?

493
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
It's wearing a skirt on its shoulders.

494
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
And it's wearing a pendant.

495
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
It's holding a bunch of pachinko balls.

496
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
It's hitting the trees.

497
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
It's in the back of the mountain.

498
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
It's hitting the trees.

499
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
The last chimp is scary.

500
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
The last chimp is really scary.

501
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
It used to be a flock.

502
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
It's amazing.

503
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Where is it going?

504
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
What?

505
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Where is it going?

506
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
It's a favorite animal.

507
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
It can't take it because it's stupid.

508
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Normally it's like this.

509
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
What is it doing?

510
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
It's biting grass.

511
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
It's biting grass.

512
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
It's this fast.

513
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
It's not very fast.

514
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
It's not very fast.

515
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,000
When the ball falls, everyone runs.

516
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Run?

517
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
It's like a chimp.

518
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
It's like a chimp.

519
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
It's amazing.

520
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
It doesn't matter if the ball falls.

521
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
It doesn't care.

522
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
It doesn't use anything?

523
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
What?

524
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
What about the pachinko balls?

525
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
It doesn't use anything.

526
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
It just runs away.

527
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
That's right.

528
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
The boss is the only one who has the pachinko balls.

529
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
I see.

530
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Everyone is doing this, but there's really nothing.

531
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
It's the boss's dream.

532
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
It comes and eats it.

533
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
What does it eat?

534
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
It's a ball.

535
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
It's a mix of many things.

536
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
It's amazing.

537
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
The last chimp.

538
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
The 4LDK in the apartment has 3LD.

539
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
It's so much that it's occupied by pet animals.

540
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
It's a favorite animal.

541
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
That's what I think.

542
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Lions are famous for being so strict that they only raise children who have fallen to the bottom of the valley.

543
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,000
I heard that even lazy people raise their children harshly.

544
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
What kind of method is it?

545
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Do you know?

546
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
That the lion has fallen to the valley.

547
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I've heard of it.

548
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
You've heard of it, haven't you?

549
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
The lion is the king of the beast.

550
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
It only raises strong animals.

551
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I see.

552
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,000
It's not that lazy people are the king of the beast or anything.

553
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
On the contrary, even if it's strong, it can't be helped.

554
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
It only raises those who are so lazy.

555
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
I see.

556
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
On the contrary.

557
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I see.

558
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
That's why it's amazing.

559
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
What kind of raising method is it?

560
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
What?

561
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Your voice is loud.

562
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
The lion will fall to the valley.

563
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:24,000
If you raise a lazy animal to a certain extent, it will burn its butt.

564
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
When it turns 20 years old.

565
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
The father will be like,

566
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Fua! Fua!

567
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
What are you doing?

568
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
It will burn its butt.

569
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
In the city?

570
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
In the city.

571
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Even if it burns, it will be like,

572
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Fua!

573
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
I don't know if it's like this.

574
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
You shouldn't make a fuss.

575
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Even if it smells like shit, it will be like,

576
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Fua!

577
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Even if it's like,

578
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Half of it is burning!

579
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
It's really hot, isn't it?

580
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
It's really hot.

581
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
It's really hot.

582
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
If you do this quickly,

583
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
It won't be good, right?

584
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
There's water in there.

585
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
It's burning its butt.

586
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
If you do this quickly, it will be like,

587
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Fua!

588
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
But if you do that, it won't be good.

589
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
If it burns its butt, it will be like,

590
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Fua!

591
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
It's already burning, but...

592
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Fua!

593
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
I want to go there quickly.

594
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
The real thing.

595
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
The father will be watching that.

596
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
How lazy is it?

597
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
You're in a hurry, aren't you?

598
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Even if it's a little,

599
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
If it's like this,

600
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
If it's like this,

601
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Fua!

602
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
If it's like this,

603
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Fua!

604
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Take it off.

605
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:55,000
