1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
When I woke up this morning, I had a headache.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
I'm wearing a sun mask.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
But the staff called me.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
What I'm going to do today is...

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I'm going to use today's drawing.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:27,000
If you look at this, you can see how the opening project is going to develop in the future.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
That's what I'm going to show you today.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
That's all I have to say.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Let's take a look at the development of the drawing.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Let's go!

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Gaki no Tsukai Aki-Fuyu Opening Project Sagi-Dori Collection

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
This program is brought to you by these sponsors.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
While talking about the history of Gaki no Tsukai, we must never forget about the competition.

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
And this is the most recent competition.

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
This is the biggest game of this century.

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Hamada vs. Matsumoto Hoka.

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
The dream golf competition!

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Hamada has absolute confidence in his golf skills.

19
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
This is a golf competition against Matsumoto Hoka.

20
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Hamada's first shot is as good as Matsumoto Hoka's four shots.

21
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
As everyone says, Hamada's first shot is a nice shot.

22
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Matsumoto is afraid of his opponent's expression.

23
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
When I get punished, my shoulders get tired.

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I want to relax my shoulders.

25
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I want to relax my shoulders.

26
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Are you okay?

27
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Hey, you're going too high.

28
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Matsumoto's first shot.

29
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
No, no, don't fall.

30
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Next is Tanaka.

31
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Okay, I flew.

32
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Where did you go?

33
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
The course.

34
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
It's open.

35
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Is it free space?

36
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
What is that?

37
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
What is free space?

38
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
On the other hand, Hamada has a long shot.

39
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Three on.

40
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Where did you go?

41
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
It's open.

42
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
No way.

43
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Really?

44
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
He missed the par, but it's the fifth.

45
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Nice, nice.

46
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Amazing.

47
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
However,

48
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Since he missed the par and it's the fifth, we're okay with 20, right?

49
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Okay.

50
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I'll hit it 12 more times.

51
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Okay.

52
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
12 times at this distance.

53
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Okay, okay.

54
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
12 times at this distance.

55
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I'll hit it and I'll close it.

56
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Okay.

57
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Thank you very much.

58
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Thank you very much.

59
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Team Matsumoto in the first hole wins easily.

60
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Next is the second hole.

61
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Hamada is the first to try to turn the tables.

62
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
However, he missed the par and it's the OB.

63
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

64
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Yes.

65
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
A rematch tee shot.

66
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Where did you go?

67
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
It's over there.

68
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Team Matsumoto in the second hole wins.

69
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Wait, wait.

70
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
It's a practice shot.

71
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Really?

72
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Really, really, really.

73
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
It's a practice shot, right?

74
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I'll go.

75
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Okay.

76
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Yes.

77
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Team Matsumoto in the second hole wins.

78
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Thank you very much.

79
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
It's finally the final hole.

80
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Team Matsumoto is mercilessly attacking Hamada.

81
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Okay.

82
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
It's good.

83
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
It's good.

84
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
It's good.

85
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
It's good.

86
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
It's good.

87
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
It's good.

88
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
It's good.

89
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I'm good, right?

90
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Amazing.

91
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
And Hamada's pad is...

92
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Wait, wait.

93
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

94
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
In the end, Hamada couldn't win even once.

95
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
After this, he started crying and added one more hole.

96
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Go down there.

97
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

98
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Oh.

99
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Hamada's ball was hated by the cup.

100
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
It's a four-time loss.

101
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Team Matsumoto has won.

102
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Team Matsumoto has won.

103
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
So.

104
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Yes.

105
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Hamada, you're out.

106
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Yeah.

107
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Yeah.

108
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Yeah.

109
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Yeah.

110
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Yeah.

111
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Yeah.

112
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Yes, yes.

113
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Three months later.

114
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
It's Akiko.

115
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
What is it?

116
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
No, no, no, no.

117
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Go to Okanto, Hollywood and play Titanic.

118
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
The penalty game is determined by the love scene of Titanic.

119
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:09,000
The sky and the machine are waiting for me in the sky.

120
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Hamada finished the hard penalty game.

121
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
A bomb came out of his mouth.

122
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Excuse me.

123
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Yes.

124
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
How about doing it again?

125
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
No, it's okay.

126
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
It's okay.

127
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
It doesn't matter what time it is.

128
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Yes.

129
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Let's improve the rules again.

130
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Are you going to improve the rules?

131
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
No, I have to improve that.

132
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Who will win the next game?

133
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
And what is the penalty game of the trial?

134
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Hamada VS Matsumoto vs Golf Reunion

135
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
The next episode is coming soon.

136
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Please look forward to it.

137
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Ladies and gentlemen.

138
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Downtown is famous for its sound when it appears in the talk.

139
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Looking back at the history of the Gaki no Tsukai 9 years,

140
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
various songs have been used so far.

141
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
And recently,

142
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Matsumoto Hitoshi's song has been used.

143
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
It is Taxi Driver.

144
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
My heart is swaying.

145
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
My love is swaying.

146
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I am a taxi driver.

147
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Taxi Driver.

148
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Hey, stop it.

149
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,000
After this, the program recruited an artist to sing the famous song Taxi Driver.

150
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
And then...

151
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Finally, a musician.

152
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I'm so happy.

153
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Please come on stage.

154
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
This is the artist.

155
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
It's Sharankyu.

156
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
The name was given by the mega hit band Sharankyu.

157
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Osaka is a comic band.

158
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I'm so happy.

159
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Your eyes are swimming today.

160
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I'm going to play the drums today.

161
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I thought I had to.

162
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I'm so happy.

163
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
The members immediately joined the sound.

164
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,000
The field has been shaking its neck.

165
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I wonder what happened to it.

166
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
That's funny.

167
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Sharankyu-san.

168
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Yes.

169
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
What's going on?

170
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I'm checking the lyrics of the song.

171
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I've never seen it before.

172
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I've never seen it before.

173
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I'm a little confused.

174
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I see.

175
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
It takes a lot of time.

176
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I'm sorry.

177
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Don't ruin my image.

178
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
It doesn't matter if it's messed up.

179
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I'll show you what it's like.

180
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
It's hard to get in.

181
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I'm a little confused.

182
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I'm a little confused.

183
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I'm a little confused.

184
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Yes.

185
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Yes.

186
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Show it to me.

187
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I don't know at all.

188
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Ina Homo.

189
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Ina Homo.

190
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
This is it.

191
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Which one?

192
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
This one.

193
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Believe in yourself.

194
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Yes.

195
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
This is how the taxi driver Sharankyu version was completed.

196
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I'm a taxi driver.

197
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I'm all right.

198
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I'm all right.

199
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:20,000
We're still looking for musicians to sing for us.

200
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:26,000
We're waiting for your call.

201
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
The most luxurious luxury project with a child's user.

202
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,000
A celebrity fishing competition where famous talents come together.

203
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Are you ready?

204
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
We're going to start.

205
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Don't be ashamed.

206
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Let's do our best.

207
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Let's go.

208
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I'm glad I have a job.

209
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:00,000
The first time started four years ago in Kawaguchiko, Fumoto, Fujino.

210
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Among the members, Matsumoto was the first hit.

211
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
It's coming.

212
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
It's coming.

213
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I'm getting impatient.

214
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I'm getting impatient.

215
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I've been fishing for a long time.

216
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,000
But after this, no one gets a hit.

217
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I'll get a hit.

218
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I'll get a hit.

219
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Liar.

220
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:38,000
In the second half, Itoi finally got a hit.

221
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
It's over.

222
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
It's over.

223
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
It's over.

224
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
It's over.

225
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
It's coming.

226
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:56,000
And Okuda got a hit.

227
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
This is good.

228
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,000
The game was narrowed down to the three of Okuda and Itoi Matsumoto.

229
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
27.

230
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
27.

231
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
8.

232
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
28.

233
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
28.

234
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
But it's 7.

235
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I'm getting impatient.

236
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
It's just 7.

237
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
It's just 7.

238
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
That means...

239
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Matsumoto wins the first game.

240
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
The first game was a success for Matsumoto.

241
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
The second game was a success for Matsumoto.

242
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:36,000
The second game was a success for Matsumoto.

243
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:44,000
This man won the first game.

244
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
That means...

245
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Matsumoto wins the second game.

246
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Matsumoto wins the second game.

247
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I got a hit.

248
00:11:53,000 --> 00:12:00,000
In the third game, the guests get a hit.

249
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Two people from downtown are left behind.

250
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
In the meantime, Itoi said something.

251
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I know how scary they are, so I won't say anything.

252
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
And the next moment.

253
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
It's coming.

254
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
It's coming.

255
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
It's coming.

256
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
It's coming.

257
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
It's coming.

258
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
It's coming.

259
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
It's coming.

260
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
It's coming.

261
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
It's coming.

262
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
It's coming.

263
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
It's coming.

264
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
It's coming.

265
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
That's good.

266
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
It's big, isn't it?

267
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
As expected of a defending champion.

268
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Will Matsumoto's hit three times in a row work?

269
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
It's 36.

270
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
36.

271
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
36.

272
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
It's dangerous.

273
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
What does that mean?

274
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
It's dangerous.

275
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
37 centimeters.

276
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Itoi wins.

277
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I'm so happy

278
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
He won 3 times in a row

279
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
This is so frustrating

280
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
The 4th Fishing Championship was held this summer

281
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Everyone except Hamada and Enuchi won the first half

282
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
It's over

283
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I have a bad feeling about this

284
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
It's over

285
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:22,000
But in the second half, Hamada, who was aiming for a comeback, won

286
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I did it

287
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I did it

288
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Second time

289
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
This is bad

290
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
This is bad

291
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
This is bad

292
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Enuchi, who was in a hurry, won right before the end

293
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
He applauded the winning battle

294
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
And the results were announced

295
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
He won 3 times in a row

296
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
He won 3 times in a row

297
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,000
This time, the winner is Hamada

298
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Thank you

299
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
A terrifying downturn

300
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
He won 3 times in a row

301
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Is it okay to leave Hamada like this?

302
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I'm a TV entertainer who likes fishing

303
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Come anytime

304
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
We are waiting for all the entertainers who like fishing

305
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Stop it

306
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Until now, Gaki no Tsukai has been broadcasting the battle of rivals for many years

307
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Among them, there are two people who are called the most passionate and eternal rivals

308
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Yamazaki Hosei vs. Moriman

309
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Their fate began two years ago with Yamazaki's humiliating defeat in the Panty Trigger Battle

310
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:03,000
After that, Yamazaki was completely defeated in the second match

311
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Even in the third match, Yamazaki was defeated by Moriman until the end of the Panty Trigger Battle

312
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Yamazaki collapsed into the ring with a scream and showed a miserable appearance

313
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,000
And again, Yamazaki challenged Moriman

314
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:27,000
The match was held in Korakuen Hall, the holy place of martial arts

315
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Yamazaki met Moriman

316
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Yamazaki vs. Moriman

317
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Yamazaki vs. Moriman

318
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Yamazaki vs. Moriman

319
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Yamazaki vs. Moriman

320
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Yamazaki vs. Moriman

321
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Yamazaki-san! Yamazaki-san! Yamazaki-san! This is interesting!

322
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Yamazaki vs. Moriman

323
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Yamazaki vs. Moriman

324
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Yamazaki, who couldn't be honest in the fourth match, ran away from the ring

325
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Yamazaki vs. Moriman

326
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
And finally, the final match was decided

327
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
What kind of finale will the long battle be?

328
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Yamazaki vs. Moriman

329
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
The last Final Revenge Match

330
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
The day when the gong rings is near

331
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
The day when the gong rings is near

332
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
The day when the gong rings is near

333
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
The comedians start with high tension and end with high tension

334
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
First, let's watch this

335
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
High tension is the greatest weapon of comedians

336
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Yamazaki vs. Moriman

337
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,000
High tension is the greatest weapon of comedians

338
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
First, this week's 10th place is

339
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
50 points

340
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Kogoriko Spartandi vs. Naoki Tanaka

341
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Kogoriko Spartandi vs. Naoki Tanaka

342
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Kogoriko Spartandi vs. Naoki Tanaka

343
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Kogoriko Spartandi vs. Naoki Tanaka

344
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Kogoriko Spartandi vs. Naoki Tanaka

345
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Let's watch this week's 3rd place

346
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Fujii Takashi vs. Otoko to Onna wa Chigau

347
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Otoko to Onna wa Chigau

348
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
This week's 1st place

349
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Kogoriko Endo Shouzou vs. Yoshi

350
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Kogoriko Endo Shouzou vs. Yoshi

351
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
From now on

352
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I will

353
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
do it

354
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
do it

355
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
do it

356
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
do it

357
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
do it

358
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
do it

359
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
do it

360
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I want to eat

361
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
corn

362
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
I want to eat

363
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
eat

364
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
eat

365
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
eat

366
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I want to eat

367
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
eat

368
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
eat

369
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:49,200
Tackle

370
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Rubble

371
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Rubble

372
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Rubble

373
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Look at your voice

374
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I'll eat

375
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
At Gaki's conversion

376
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
We're hiring a great comedian who will bring you tremendous high tension

377
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Get ready

378
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
High Tension Game

379
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Up until now, Gaki no Tsukai has filed a lawsuit for various suspicions

380
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
and has passed judgement under a fair trial.

381
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
This is it!

382
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
It's so natural!

383
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,000
And now, here is the lawsuit that is the biggest problem with Gaki.

384
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
High Tension Game

385
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:42,000
From Tadayama, we will now begin the High Tension Game with Akihiro Ohnuma.

386
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Gaki, the famous director, Akihiro Ohnuma.

387
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
The trial began with the accusation that this man, who looks like he has two sides to him,

388
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:57,000
is actually a real high tension guy and is a nuisance to the people around him.

389
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,000
High Tension Game

390
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
From Tadayama, we will now begin the High Tension Game with Akihiro Ohnuma.

391
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,000
That was when we were filming in Yoshinoya.

392
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Yes, I remember this.

393
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:17,000
After the filming, the producer received a beef bowl from someone at the restaurant.

394
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Hey, you guys! I received a beef bowl!

395
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Share it with everyone!

396
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Yay! I did it!

397
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Ohnuma, who was watching the scene, caught the AD.

398
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Hey, what did you receive earlier?

399
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
It was a beef bowl from Yoshinoya.

400
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Give it to me. Give it to me.

401
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Surprisingly, the AD took the beef bowl from him.

402
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
That night...

403
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Today, we are going to eat out. Hurry up and get ready.

404
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Yay! I did it!

405
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,000
The destination they arrived at was Yoshinoya.

406
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
And of course, the payment will be...

407
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Please pay with this Tadaken.

408
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
How many tickets will you take?

409
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I will take all the tickets I received.

410
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:20,000
All of them? All of them?

411
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
All of them?

412
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
I have something else to tell you.

413
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Ohnuma also received a beef bowl.

414
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
What? Wait a minute.

415
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
I can't accept this.

416
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
What do you mean?

417
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
This is too much.

418
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
What do you mean?

419
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
What do you mean? How many tickets did you receive?

420
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
50,000 yen.

421
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Please announce the verdict.

422
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:59,000
The defendant, Ohnuma, has caused a lot of trouble to the people.

423
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Therefore, there is no room for defense.

424
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
The verdict is...

425
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
He will dance on the street.

426
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Ohnuma was sentenced to one year in prison.

427
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:16,000
However, the program is still looking for a witness for Ohnuma.

428
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:22,000
If the director of Ohnuma has caused any damage, please let us know.

429
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,000
The program is still looking for Ohnuma.

430
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
And finally, this announcement.

431
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
I will come to see you again.

432
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:42,000
I will come to see the people of downtown again.

433
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Thank you very much. It was fun.

434
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,000
The famous people who want to see the talk of downtown live.

435
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Please come to play anytime.

436
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:57,000
So, Gakky will have a golf match.

437
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:02,000
And Yamazaki vs. Moriman match.

438
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:08,000
I want to do it more and more in the future.

439
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:13,000
I was suddenly called out by Yue.

440
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Please look forward to it.

441
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:31,000
