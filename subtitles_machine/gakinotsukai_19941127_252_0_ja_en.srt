1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
This is the 5th episode of Gaki no Tsukai, Tsukishige! Tsukikirai Dottieru!

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Hello, hello.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
It's been a while.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
This is the 5th episode.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
That's right.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
It's been a while.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
It's really been a while.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
It's been a while.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I don't like it.

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Let's just say that this isn't our intention.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I'll put it on without permission.

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
That's right.

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
We'll talk in a way that you don't know where to start.

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm really sorry for the entertainers who got it.

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
That's right.

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'll talk about how to do it.

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm afraid it'll take forever.

18
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Are you apologizing or not?

19
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Then shall we do it?

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Isn't it obvious?

21
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Oh, is that so?

22
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
That's right.

23
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
There's a lot of heavy stuff in here today.

24
00:00:48,000 --> 00:01:02,000
This program is brought to you by the sponsors you see.

25
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Okay.

26
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Let's go.

27
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Here we go.

28
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Thank you very much.

29
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Stop it.

30
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I've been watching you all this time.

31
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Hey, hey.

32
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
That's enough.

33
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Even if it's done, it's still a scene.

34
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Wait, wait.

35
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Let's try your hate.

36
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Do you hate me?

37
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I hate you.

38
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
This is a good thing.

39
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:45,000
It seems to be the most hated woman in the world right now.

40
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I don't know why you hate me so much.

41
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Well, I hate you.

42
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
What do you hate about me?

43
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
The way you talk.

44
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
You look like you have a bad breath.

45
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I don't think it's a good idea to say that just for the sake of image.

46
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
No, no, no.

47
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
You're watching TV.

48
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
It's just an image, isn't it?

49
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I hate you.

50
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Hey, if you really have a bad breath, say it.

51
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
When I went to the bathroom, it smelled like poop.

52
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
It doesn't matter if you say that.

53
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Matsunosuke Shio was angry.

54
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
It stinks.

55
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
It seems that the image of the drama was quite bad in this case.

56
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
There was a drama that I was doing with Ken Ogata.

57
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,000
The role at that time was so unaccepted by women.

58
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I feel sorry for that.

59
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Please follow me.

60
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I hate you.

61
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
It doesn't matter where you are.

62
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I hate you.

63
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I hate you.

64
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I want you to do your best.

65
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I'm sending you an e-mail.

66
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I'm sending you an e-mail.

67
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Rather than saying that you hate me, I want you to say,

68
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I hate you.

69
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I want you to do your best.

70
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I think it would be nice if I could see it in the Keirai line.

71
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Do you like it?

72
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Yes.

73
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Next to this.

74
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Do you like this?

75
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
It's cool, isn't it?

76
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
What do you mean?

77
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
The eyebrows are drawn more than necessary.

78
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
He is a young actor now.

79
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Is that so?

80
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I think everyone is watching him now.

81
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Do you want to be like him?

82
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I want to be like him when I'm young.

83
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I see.

84
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
It's cool.

85
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
What are you doing to my favorite child?

86
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Stop it.

87
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
What are you doing to my favorite child?

88
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
It's disgusting.

89
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
It's about this.

90
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
It's a song.

91
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
This person is good.

92
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
What is good about him?

93
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
What is good about him?

94
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
He doesn't do much activity.

95
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
He is doing it.

96
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
He earns more than I do.

97
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
But I think he is short-tempered.

98
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
But why is he short-tempered?

99
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
When he appears on TV, do you watch him?

100
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I saw him.

101
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
That's not good.

102
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
It's not a variety show.

103
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I saw him.

104
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I don't want to be next to him.

105
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I saw him in the quiz.

106
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Do you watch him when he appears on TV?

107
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
But I like him.

108
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
What are you talking about?

109
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
People who support him are different.

110
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Is that so?

111
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Tell me what you hate about him.

112
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
You hate him a lot.

113
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
No, I don't hate him.

114
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
What are you talking about?

115
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I don't like him.

116
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
What?

117
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I can't forgive him.

118
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
When I was young, I didn't like him.

119
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:29,000
You don't like him at all.

120
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
When he appears in front of you, you don't like him.

121
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
That's right.

122
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I don't like him.

123
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I like him as a man.

124
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I got it.

125
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Hurry up.

126
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I don't like him.

127
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I don't know how you feel.

128
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I hate him.

129
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I hate him.

130
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
In the middle.

131
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Rikiya-san.

132
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
He looks like a kind person.

133
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I'm just kidding.

134
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I can beat him.

135
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
He is my country typhoon.

136
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
What kind of technique is that?

137
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I can't beat him.

138
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I can't beat him.

139
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Country typhoon?

140
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
You look weak.

141
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
You look weak just by saying country.

142
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I can't beat him.

143
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Is that so?

144
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Tell me what you like about him.

145
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Okay.

146
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Do you like him?

147
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
No, I don't like him.

148
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I don't like him at all.

149
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I haven't seen him before.

150
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Do you like him that much?

151
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
If you say so.

152
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
It's been a long time since he came back to Golden Brown.

153
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
He came back.

154
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
That's right.

155
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
In that sense.

156
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I found him.

157
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
That's right.

158
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Let's go next.

159
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Okay.

160
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Next.

161
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Do you like him?

162
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Is that so?

163
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I like the way he looks.

164
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Even though he is a porn star.

165
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
If I could see him a little bit.

166
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I like his attitude.

167
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I love his attitude.

168
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I want to kill him.

169
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I love him so much that I want to kill him.

170
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
That's right.

171
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I really want you to do your best.

172
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Who is that?

173
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
MCAT.

174
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
His real name is Ichiro Yanagida.

175
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Is that so?

176
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
His real name is Okamoto Takeshi.

177
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Okamoto-kun.

178
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
He always wears a spear-like hat.

179
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Okamoto-kun.

180
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
He has a very low back.

181
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
When I see him.

182
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
He has an attitude like this.

183
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Like this.

184
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Boom.

185
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
That's what he says.

186
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I don't know him very well.

187
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
You still like him.

188
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
That's right.

189
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I like him.

190
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
That's right.

191
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Who is this?

192
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Who is this?

193
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Do you like him so much?

194
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Can I sit over there?

195
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
But I like him.

196
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
What is this?

197
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
You put out a record, didn't you?

198
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
That's right.

199
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I don't want to see him.

200
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
But I'm late at night.

201
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I watch TV until the end.

202
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I don't like smelly things.

203
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I hate it.

204
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
That's right.

205
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I turn off the TV.

206
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
But I don't like it.

207
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I can't help it.

208
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Jesus.

209
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Jesus.

210
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
You remember it too much.

211
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I don't like it.

212
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
On the contrary, I want to tease him.

213
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
But this kind of woman is a narrow-minded woman.

214
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
You put out a record, didn't you?

215
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I make a record.

216
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
You make a record.

217
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Amen.

218
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I'm very happy.

219
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Jesus.

220
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Thank you.

221
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Last week, a woman came to my house.

222
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
She said,

223
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I'm here.

224
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
If you don't say that, I have a follow-up report.

225
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I don't know what time it was.

226
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
It was past 12 o'clock.

227
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I heard a sound.

228
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
It's the same.

229
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I said,

230
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Yes.

231
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I saw it on the monitor.

232
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I saw it on AVEC.

233
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
That's a rare pattern.

234
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
This is Hama's house.

235
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
What?

236
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I was surprised.

237
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I started to kiss her.

238
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Her eyes were in front of the monitor.

239
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I hugged her and hugged her.

240
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I kissed her.

241
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
What should I do?

242
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
It's amazing.

243
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
It's sweet.

244
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
It's sweet.

245
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Don't do that.

246
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
You come to my house.

247
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
That's right.

248
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I'm scared.

249
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
What's the follow-up report?

250
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
It's been a week since then.

251
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Is it the same person?

252
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
The same person came again.

253
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I didn't keep my promise.

254
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
What is the purpose?

255
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Please give me a hug.

256
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I understand.

257
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Let's shake hands.

258
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
But...

259
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Don't do that.

260
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I'll give you a hug.

261
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Don't do that.

262
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I can't do that.

263
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I can't fall in love with a woman I like.

264
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I can't do that.

265
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I can't fall in love with a woman I like.

266
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Don't say that.

267
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I'm not interested in women.

268
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I can't do that.

269
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Don't say that.

270
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
You're the only one I like.

271
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
She told you that.

272
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I'm angry.

273
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
She was angry at me.

274
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
That's right.

275
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Stop it.

276
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Don't do that.

277
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
You stay away from me.

278
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Don't do that.

279
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
You stay away from me.

280
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Don't do that.

281
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
You stay away from me.

282
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Please don't do that.

283
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I'm angry.

284
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Please don't do that.

285
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I'm angry.

286
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Stop it!

287
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
You're the one who's saying that it's ugly.

288
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
The ugly thing I'm saying is, even though it's ugly...

289
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
You're the one who's saying it's ugly.

290
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Even though it's not good,

291
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Yes, yes, yes.

292
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I'm saying that it's the ugly thing that you haven't noticed.

293
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
It's strange that you admit it, but the ugly thing in the world,

294
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
many ugly things, you don't think they're ugly, right?

295
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
For example, even though he has a face of about 50 points,

296
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
even though he's handsome,

297
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,000
there's no one who can understand that he has 50 points, right?

298
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
For example, if you're a man,

299
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
if you only talk about the face, it's really about 30 points, right?

300
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Even if you say that you have 30 points,

301
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
you think you have 50 points, right?

302
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
That's not good!

303
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
When I look at you like that, I get angry and run away.

304
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
How many points are you running away from?

305
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
How many points do you think you have?

306
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
80 points.

307
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
So, you have a sin of 50 points.

308
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Even though you have 30 points, 80 means 50.

309
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Yes, yes, yes.

310
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Can't you just increase it?

311
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Yes, yes.

312
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Can't you just increase it?

313
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
This anger is my anger of 50 points,

314
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
and it's my country typhoon.

315
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Can't you forget it?

316
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Can't you forget your own skill?

317
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
It's really a typhoon, isn't it?

318
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Yes, yes, yes.

319
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Can't you just increase the typhoon?

320
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Everyone thinks you have 30 points.

321
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I've heard that you have 30 points.

322
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Hey, wait a minute.

323
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
What kind of conversation is it that I have 30 points?

324
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
What kind of talk is that?

325
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
When I got on the plane, I said that I was a captain.

326
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I'm an announcer.

327
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I'm going through a bad place right now.

328
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Anyway, you have 30 points.

329
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I have 30 points.

330
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I don't care.

331
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I don't care if I get angry.

332
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
How many points do you think you have?

333
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I don't care if you give me points.

334
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I don't play with looks.

335
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I don't care about that.

336
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
How many points do you think you have?

337
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I don't want to be honest.

338
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Of course.

339
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
How far can you go?

340
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Only your face?

341
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Or this really...

342
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Red body?

343
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
It's not red.

344
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
So what's my 30 points?

345
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
A total score of 30 points?

346
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Only your face.

347
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Then give me the whole thing.

348
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Put the whole thing in?

349
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
If you put the whole thing in, it's 30 points.

350
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
What?

351
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
It's not increasing.

352
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
It's increasing.

353
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
It's a plus point.

354
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Why is it increasing?

355
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Look over there.

356
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Turn around.

357
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
30 points.

358
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Turn around.

359
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I don't know what you're doing.

360
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
It's okay.

361
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
It's okay if you're the same age as Matsumoto.

362
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
How many points do you have?

363
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I'll be honest.

364
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
85 points.

365
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
85?

366
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
It's okay.

367
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I don't care.

368
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I don't care.

369
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:09,000
It's just that you have a handicap.

370
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
It's a handicap.

371
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
It started with a bunker when I was born.

372
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Wait a minute.

373
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
This is really rude.

374
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
How many points do you have?

375
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I don't think it's as hard as everyone says.

376
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
It's about 40.

377
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Wait a minute.

378
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
No, no, no.

379
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Thank you for your help.

380
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Wait.

381
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I have 30 points, but why do you all have 40 points?

382
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Why is your score so low?

383
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:48,000
First of all, you rely on medicine.

384
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
This is the most important thing.

385
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Wait.

386
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
What kind of technology is that?

387
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I didn't do anything.

388
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Say something.

389
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Everyone is too determined with their characters.

390
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Don't you think so?

391
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
For example?

392
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
For example, Shimura Ken.

393
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
His face is quite masculine.

394
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Is it masculine?

395
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Just by looking at his face.

396
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
It's not masculine.

397
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
If you look up, you'll think it's hard.

398
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
But Mr. Ikagaya is...

399
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I'm not angry.

400
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
He's also a bunker.

401
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I'm angry.

402
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I've never seen a person who is said to be the second best actor.

403
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
It's called Tsutsui something.

404
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
It's not ugly, is it?

405
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
How many points does he have?

406
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Tsutsui?

407
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Tsutsui has about 50 points.

408
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Tsutsui has 50 points.

409
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
You're looking for something lower than yourself.

410
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I don't think I'm the worst.

411
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Who is lower than me?

412
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Who is lower than you?

413
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
There's a lot of them.

414
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I don't know if I'm lower than you, but I know someone like you.

415
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Who?

416
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Oguchi.

417
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,000
It's Oguchi.

418
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I did it.

419
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
It's Oguchi.

420
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Is Oguchi lower than 30?

421
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I don't know.

422
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Who is said to be the most muscular man?

423
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
It's me.

424
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
It's me in your evaluation.

425
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Really?

426
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
How many points do you have?

427
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
My own?

428
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
70 points.

429
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
65 points.

430
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I won't give it to you.

431
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
If it's 65 points, it's 27 points.

432
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
That's mean.

433
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
It's not mean.

434
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
It's sad.

435
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Why?

436
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Is it sad if it's 65 points?

437
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
How many points do you have?

438
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I'll give you half.

439
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
If it's at least 40 points, I'll give it to you.

440
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I'll tell you the truth.

441
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
You.

442
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
30 points.

443
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I want to tell you the truth.

444
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I'm sorry.

445
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Don't say sorry.

446
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I'm really sorry this time.

447
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
This is serious.

448
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
How many points do you have for me?

449
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
About 50 points.

450
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Really?

451
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Are you happy with 50 points?

452
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Hey.

453
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Wait.

454
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
You have a low score of 50 points.

455
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
And the audience is surprised by your score of 50 points.

456
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Really?

457
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I'll give you half for 65 points.

458
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
How many points do you have for 30 points?

459
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
No one has a problem with this guy's score of 50 points, right?

460
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
This is serious.

461
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Sing more.

462
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I don't want to talk with you anymore.

463
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
If you don't do it here, I can't help you.

464
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
You have to sing more.

465
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I'll ask you every time.

466
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
How many points do you have?

467
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Okay.

468
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Okay, come to the academy later.

469
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I can't believe you have 89 points.

470
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I was looking for a guy who has the same score as me.

471
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
But it's Jean Claude Van Damme.

472
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
There are many kinds of people.

473
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
How many points do you have?

474
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Is your scouter correct?

475
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
What about Clipper?

476
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Who is Clipper?

477
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Ah, Higashi.

478
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I bought it.

479
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Did you compare it with Clipper?

480
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Matsumoto used to be called the god of pantomime.

481
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Please show it.

482
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
He was called the god of pantomime.

483
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
He was called the silent artist.

484
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Well, that's the way it is.

485
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
He was called like that.

486
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Today, I'll show you the wall.

487
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
That's...

488
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
That's a complete amateur.

489
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,000
If you ask me to show you the wall, an amateur will do it right away.

490
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I can't do that.

491
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Are you sure?

492
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Yes.

493
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,000
I'll ask you something.

494
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Do you always touch the real wall when you see it?

495
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
You don't touch it, do you?

496
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
I don't care. Please do it.

497
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
That's the appearance.

498
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
That's your point of view.

499
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
This is the real wall.

500
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
No, that's not true.

501
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I think that's an advanced technique.

502
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Ah, I see.

503
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
But, in general,

504
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
like this.

505
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Please show me this.

506
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
If you want to do it, you have to take it off.

507
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Please wear it.

508
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
What?

509
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Ah, that's the way it is.

510
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
You have to make your body soft.

511
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
That's the way it is.

512
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
It's not bent so much.

513
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
How about this?

514
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
What?

515
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
The wall.

516
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Please show me the wall.

517
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
I can't do it without a song.

518
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,000
What kind of song do you want?

519
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Who told you to dance?

520
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
The wall.

521
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
I'm thirsty.

522
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
The wall that comes close.

523
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
The wall that comes close?

524
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
It's a normal wall.

525
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
What are you doing?

526
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
It's simple.

527
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
You have to make your body soft.

528
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
That's the way it is.

529
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
You have to make your body soft.

530
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
You have to make your body soft.

531
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
I'm sorry.

532
00:23:48,000 --> 00:24:00,000
What are you doing?

533
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:19,000
I was surprised.
