1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The next defendant, Heipo, please come forward.

2
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
That's not possible.

3
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
The defendant, Heipo.

4
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:56,000
He is a child-treatment team selector, but he has been sentenced to 2 years in prison for his misconduct.

5
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Even now, it is clear that the thinness of the punishment is causing a lot of trouble to the people.

6
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:13,000
The victims' strong hopes have led to the third and even thinner punishment being decided.

7
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm scared!

8
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
This program is brought to you by the following sponsors.

9
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Prosecutor Hamada, please present your evidence.

10
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:27,500
Yes!

11
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:33,000
As in other trials, we have a VTR of the many evil deeds of the Heipou.

12
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
First, please look at this.

13
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Yes, yes, yes!

14
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
It's the Heipou-sama's bird!

15
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Yay! Heipou-san!

16
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Let's take a picture together!

17
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Yes, yes, that's fine!

18
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Hey, Pou!

19
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Hey, Pou has been on TV a lot lately.

20
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,000
The girls in the city are foolish, but recently she has been able to talk to celebrities and she is very popular.

21
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
She's so popular. There's nothing I can do.

22
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Please listen to this news.

23
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Hello, this is Maria. I want to meet with Hey, Pou. Please call me when you think about it.

24
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
What is this?

25
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
That's right, it's Yamada Maria-chan

26
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:32,000
In the previous Heipou trial, Heipou didn't know Yamada Maria at all, even though he had met her before

27
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:39,000
And because of that incident, he was able to talk to Yamada Maria on the phone

28
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Isn't that amazing, Heipou?

29
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:51,000
This is the voice of a woman who is completely in love. Maria-chan seems to have fallen for me.

30
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
It's different from being on TV.

31
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:07,000
What are you saying? It has nothing to do with TV. This is the result of the attraction of my men. You don't understand the gai.

32
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Heipo, who was so excited that he was about to lose his voice.

33
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I've been invited to a date by Maria-chan.

34
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
There might be an electric shock soon.

35
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
You're a fool.

36
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
And a few days later, the servant was having a meeting.

37
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Hey, Heipo. What happened to Maria-chan after that?

38
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Of course, I met her. It was so much fun.

39
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Hey Po, isn't it amazing?

40
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I'm jealous.

41
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
It's really good, isn't it?

42
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Leave it to me.

43
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:48,000
However, as a joke, Hey Po was invited to the stage of the appearance of Maria Yamada.

44
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Please watch from the audience seat.

45
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Maria-chan.

46
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
President, I would like to make an appointment for this incident.

47
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Understood. Please enter the showroom.

48
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
This is from Producer Suga.

49
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
The VTR you just saw was a perfect example of reality.

50
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I asked the people at the agency after that.

51
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Apparently, he went to the dressing room after the show ended.

52
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I see.

53
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I said, I have to say hello to Maria.

54
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,000
When I said, good work, good work, Maria-chan said, good work, see you later.

55
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
She didn't say that to anyone else.

56
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
It was a very cool situation.

57
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
She said she left with a bouquet of flowers.

58
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Is that a fact?

59
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
That is a fact.

60
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,000
But why did you lie in front of everyone, even though you had such a relationship?

61
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Well, because Maria-chan said she wanted to see me and called me.

62
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
No, no, no.

63
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I'd like to...

64
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
You're a student, right?

65
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
No, no, that's not it.

66
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
But you said you wanted to go on a date, right?

67
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
No, no, normally when you go on a date, you're in a position where you can't see the other two.

68
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
No, no, no.

69
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
You're acting as if you're alone.

70
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I've always emphasized that I'd meet her alone.

71
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
That's completely a lie.

72
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
You've never met her alone, right?

73
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Well...

74
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
After that...

75
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
You haven't!

76
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I've been in a lot of loose calls with Maria-chan.

77
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
It's a bit of a no-go.

78
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
But, well, Tane-san is busy.

79
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
You're not being treated as an opponent, right?

80
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
The stage is also a subject. I have a lot of them.

81
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Do you go into those loose calls?

82
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I do sometimes.

83
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Why do you say those loose calls in such a strong way?

84
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
There is a voice of a woman who wants to go on a date, right?

85
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Ah, there is.

86
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
It was that kind of voice. This one, I definitely have to buy.

87
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
That kind of voice? Do you know it?

88
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Of course I know it.

89
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I know it.

90
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I know it.

91
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
No, this person is a very good person.

92
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:10,000
The story of the first girl

93
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:17,000
This is the story of the time when Heipo and Suga introduced the girls to their workmates

94
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Hey, it's fun today

95
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I wonder what kind of girl will come

96
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
And then the workmate appeared

97
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Sorry, I can't come alone today

98
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Why? If I do that, I'll be the only one to get burned!

99
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
He's confused about something unexpected, but he doesn't know what he's doing.

100
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Suga-chan is also cool.

101
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Garth! Why are you so flustered?

102
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
You're so flustered and cool!

103
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I'm fine today, so you do your best!

104
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I'll be quiet!

105
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Thank you, Heipo!

106
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Heipo is very sincere. The three of them are waiting for the girl.

107
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,000
It seems like she hasn't come yet. Then I'll drink a little and wait.

108
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
That's right. Then I'll have a Tio Pepe. Please give me a Tio Pepe.

109
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
What? What is a Tio Pepe?

110
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
What is it, Heipo? Don't you know what a Tio Pepe is?

111
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
A Tio Pepe is a dried cherry drink.

112
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I didn't know at all.

113
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Then, give me a Tio Pepe too.

114
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
After a few minutes.

115
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Ah, this is Tio Pepe.

116
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:51,360
Hey, Heipo, you're not even a

117
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Saku-Saku, are you okay?

118
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Of course I'm okay!

119
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
What is this?

120
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
This is too hard for me!

121
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I don't need this anymore!

122
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Tio Pepe is...

123
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Then, the two girls who were waiting for him appeared.

124
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Sorry to keep you waiting.

125
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
The two of them were model-like beauties.

126
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
When Heipo saw them, he was like...

127
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Oh, isn't that nice?

128
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Let me introduce you. This is Mr. Suga.

129
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Hello, I'm Suga.

130
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I'm Heipo from the world.

131
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Please come this way.

132
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:27,000
What a surprise! Heipo forgot his promise and started to make a girl all by himself.

133
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
And then...

134
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Everyone, I have a very good sake. Would you like to try it?

135
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Wow! I want to try it!

136
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Excuse me, could I have a Tio Pepe?

137
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Tio Pepe? What is Tio Pepe?

138
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Tio Pepe is a dried jelly. It's very delicious.

139
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Wow, Heipou-san is so smart!

140
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
He's so quick to get angry.

141
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
After that, Heipou was always in the middle of the drinking party, and he didn't leave the girl's side.

142
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
He was always so sluggish.

143
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
And after the drinking party, when Ichido left the bar...

144
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
What a bad face!

145
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Mom, you know what's going on, right?

146
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
If you know, then hurry and go home!

147
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Having said that, Heiko disappeared into the city at night.

148
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
That's so sassy!

149
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
What is he, anyway?

150
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I'm always angry.

151
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I see.

152
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
And then, he was a tall, pretty boy.

153
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
That's true.

154
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
And on the way home, he said,

155
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Gassu, we're adults, right?

156
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Yes, we are.

157
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
If you're adults, think about it properly!

158
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Bye!

159
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I was like, what the hell is this?

160
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I was like, what the hell is this?

161
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
And then, the girl was living in Suginami or something in a taxi.

162
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,000
She was supposed to go drinking next, but she suddenly decided to go to that apartment in a taxi.

163
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
And then, she said, Excuse me, driver, Suginami, please.

164
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
And then, I don't know if she was lighting up or not.

165
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,000
So the girl said, Sorry, Sachi-san, my brother is coming from the country. I'm sorry for today.

166
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,600
He got off the car and took a taxi.

167
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,100
Excuse me.

168
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:07,800
He took a high-speed train and said,

169
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,300
Please take me to Oimachi.

170
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:15,300
Do you like big women?

171
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:16,000
Yes.

172
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,200
I like people who are about 170 cm tall.

173
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,800
Mr. Motoko Obayashi is a serious type.

174
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,000
Wow!

175
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:22,800
Really.

176
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,000
How many are there in the average?

177
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,800
I think there are about 160.

178
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,400
Then there are probably no 160.

179
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,600
There are definitely no 160.

180
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,600
I killed 150 people.

181
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,600
After that, you went home without anything, right?

182
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,600
Actually, I was waiting for a long time.

183
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,600
What?

184
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:48,600
I thought I would come back to see Mr. Heipo again, so I went out once and came back again.

185
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,600
This was a secret to Mr. Sugasa.

186
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,600
I see.

187
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,600
You can't do anything if you go back.

188
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,600
I didn't come out after all.

189
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,600
You didn't ping-pong?

190
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,600
I thought I wouldn't like it if a strange person came out.

191
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,600
I don't like weird people coming out, but you're weird.

192
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:16,600
This is a meeting of a program that trains new entertainers.

193
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:22,600
Saito-san, I'm thinking of having the new entertainers enter the comic contest.

194
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:25,600
Yes, yes, yes, yes, doesn't that sound interesting?

195
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,600
Then let's contact the entertainers right away.

196
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,600
Let's go!

197
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,600
Wait a minute! You guys are really boring people!

198
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,600
What are you going to do now?

199
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:45,600
We're going to secretly register you for a comic contest and announce it in the studio!

200
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,600
It's a prank! A prank!

201
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,600
That's right, Heppo-san! That's definitely going to work!

202
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:55,600
With this, we can see the artist's serious reaction and this time it's a prank!

203
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:00,600
But everyone, please don't get caught.

204
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,600
I'm sure of it!

205
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:05,600
With the idea of the paper, we decided to do a prank.

206
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,600
And on the day of the show...

207
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,600
Everyone, today is a prank, so be careful not to get caught!

208
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,600
It's okay! It's perfect!

209
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:16,600
The staff members who were preparing for the prank,

210
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,600
and the new entertainer who was the target of the prank,

211
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,600
were about to enter the studio.

212
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,600
At that time...

213
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:25,600
Uwaaa! It's late again!

214
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,600
Ah, Saito-san! Good morning!

215
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,600
Thank you for today!

216
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,600
Thank you!

217
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,600
Yes, yes, I'm asking you for a favor.

218
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,600
I'm expecting you guys.

219
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:38,600
Because you're going to be in the Kenyan Comedian Contest.

220
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,600
Eeeh!? Really!?

221
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,600
No way!

222
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,600
You said it...

223
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,600
Yes, yes, that's right. You were surprised, right?

224
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,600
It's the Kenyan Comedian Contest.

225
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:50,200
And, the prank that you will announce on the show...

226
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:53,800
Ah, I said it!

227
00:12:53,800 --> 00:13:00,200
Heipo himself said the prank that he said before the show.

228
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:05,600
I'm sorry, but please don't tell anyone about this. Please don't tell anyone.

229
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:11,600
Heipo stopped everyone from saying that he said the prank.

230
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:16,000
It's not like he was not good at acting in the show.

231
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Ah, don't say it!

232
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
The court will now decide the witness.

233
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Understood. The witness, please enter.

234
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
This is the writer's personal report.

235
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Is this the truth?

236
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
It's the truth.

237
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I've expressed it a bit softly in the video, but...

238
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I didn't realize that I had been pranking him.

239
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I was talking about the Manzai Concours forever.

240
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
HOOOOOO!

241
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I noticed it on my way.

242
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I was pulling it a little.

243
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I noticed that and I tried to break it.

244
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
OOOOOOOO!

245
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I see.

246
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I want to kill you.

247
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
This person is really stupid.

248
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
It's harsh.

249
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
You didn't notice this at all.

250
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Well, since you're human, your lips slip.

251
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I think it's okay to say it.

252
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
There's a place where you can't slip.

253
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
It's a place where you can't say it.

254
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I think that's where you need to ask the comedians to understand and react.

255
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
It's not like that!

256
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
It's not like that!

257
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
You destroyed a whole film!

258
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
If you say it more, you might have destroyed a whole group of comedians.

259
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
That's the most troublesome thing for comedians.

260
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
There are some people who should say it.

261
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Huh?

262
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
No, no, no.

263
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
No, no, no.

264
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
You're still talking back.

265
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
This is a bit annoying.

266
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
There's one more.

267
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
There was a series called the Limit.

268
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
The Limit of the Cold Chinese.

269
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,000
It was a secret show at the restaurant.

270
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Before the show, we went to check on the restaurant.

271
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
How crowded the restaurant was.

272
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:06,000
When the director of the North Korean movie was going to the police, he appeared.

273
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
When the store manager came, he said,

274
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Today, I look forward to working with you.

275
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,000
This is also a ruined pattern.

276
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Oh, I see.

277
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
He said such a thing.

278
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Why?

279
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I should have said hello to you 50 years ago.

280
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
No, no, no.

281
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I think it's fine to be angry, but I think you know that you have to be silent about the blue flower.

282
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Why?

283
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I said hello by mistake.

284
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
It was a mistake, right?

285
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I'm sorry.

286
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
You shouldn't say that.

287
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I'm sorry.

288
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
You're saying that you made a mistake.

289
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
We're sorry.

290
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
We're sorry.

291
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:55,000
This is a story that a female staff member told me when she went to the company.

292
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Hey, what do you do for a living?

293
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I work at a boutique. What do you do for a living?

294
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I'm a staff member for a children's show.

295
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
No way! A staff member for a children's show?

296
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Oh, by the way, that Heipou came to our shop the other day, but he came to my head!

297
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
That's not true.

298
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,000
According to the girl, that day Heipou came to the shop by himself.

299
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Heipou, Heipou, la la la la la la la.

300
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Ah, here, here.

301
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Welcome!

302
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Ah, are you Mr. Heipo?

303
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Yes, yes, that's right. I'm Heipo.

304
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I'm so happy you came to our shop.

305
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
What are you looking for today?

306
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Today, I came to look for a pair of shoes that would suit a gentleman like me.

307
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Ah, then come over here.

308
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Heipo immediately looks for the shoes that suit him.

309
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
And...

310
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Ah, this is nice.

311
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
It suits me perfectly, doesn't it?

312
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I think it suits you very well.

313
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I see. Then, please give me the smallest size of this.

314
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Understood. Please wait a moment.

315
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
A few minutes later.

316
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
He found his favorite shoes and put them on.

317
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
However...

318
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Huh?

319
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
They're too big.

320
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
They're too big.

321
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
What did you do to them?

322
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
They're too big for this size.

323
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Please bring me a smaller one.

324
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I'm truly sorry.

325
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
That shoe is the smallest size in this store.

326
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
What is this?

327
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,000
This store doesn't suit a gentleman like me.

328
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
What is this?

329
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I won't come here again.

330
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
This Sanribo Dick.

331
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:45,000
When he realized that he didn't have the size, he left with a huge smile.

332
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
What? There's no way there are such small shoes!

333
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Not only the staff, but also the general public were troubled by this.

334
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Everyone, you can't go to a third-rate store like this!

335
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Ebo-san, how big are your feet?

336
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,000
About 24 inches.

337
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Then, there's no such thing.

338
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
No, no, no.

339
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
No, no, no.

340
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
No, no, no.

341
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Even if you don't have it, you can just go home.

342
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Why do you have it?

343
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
That's the most frustrating thing.

344
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I like it, but I don't have it.

345
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I have to think more forward.

346
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
That kind of...

347
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Huh?

348
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
What?

349
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
What?

350
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
What?

351
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
What?

352
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
What?

353
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
What?

354
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I'm still asking.

355
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I'm listening.

356
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
What are you doing, Taira-san?

357
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:38,000
The

358
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Yamachan Quest that was broadcasted last year.

359
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
The Heipo on the air is...

360
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Scary!

361
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I can't break the screen at all.

362
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I can't break it.

363
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Heipo, shut up!

364
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Shut up!

365
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Actually, in this village, a very terrible incident has happened.

366
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Before the recording, the director explains the secret hiding place in the haunted house.

367
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Well, Heipou-san, please hide here and scare Hamada-san.

368
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I see. You don't think I'm hiding here as a ghost, do you?

369
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,000
If that's the case, I'm sure you'll be surprised and you'll be able to film something you've never seen before.

370
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Leave it to me!

371
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
As expected of the director of the show.

372
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,000
He quickly understands the intentions of the Onuma and enters the haunted house.

373
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Now, please watch the shocking video that happened while he was on standby.

374
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Please watch.

375
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Please don't do that.

376
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
You can't stay here.

377
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I'm scared.

378
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
I'm scared.

379
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Please come in.

380
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I'm scared.

381
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
I'm scared.

382
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
No, no, no.

383
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:34,000
No, no, no. I'm scared.

384
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Akari, you were okay.

385
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,000
I don't like you being so prepared.

386
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Stay here.

387
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
I'm scared.

388
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I'm going to drink it.

389
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,000
I don't know the magic.

390
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
I'm sorry.

391
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
I'm scared.

392
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I'll do it here, but I'll do it in front.

393
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I'm scared.

394
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Today?

395
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I'm scared.

396
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
He's here.

397
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I'm scared.

398
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
I can't do this.

399
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
It's not in yet.

400
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I wasn't scared.

401
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
I'm scared.

402
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
I can't do this.

403
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I can't do this.

404
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Take it off.

405
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I'm scared.

406
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I'm going to do it again!

407
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Ah! Ah! Ah!

408
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
I'm going to do it again!

409
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
What?

410
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
That's disgusting!

411
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
This is...

412
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
This is...

413
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
This is really shocking!

414
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Why?

415
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Why are you doing this?

416
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
It's scary, isn't it?

417
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
It's scary even in the room.

418
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
You're saying things like,

419
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
I can't do it today!

420
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
It has nothing to do with that.

421
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
O-Numa and Shion are so annoying!

422
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Stop it! You're making me angry!

423
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
O-Numa, you hit your junior, right?

424
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Of course.

425
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
That's right.

426
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
I wanted to hit my senior too.

427
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
That's right. In that situation.

428
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
What are you so scared of?

429
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Because there are ghosts, right?

430
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Eh?

431
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Stop it!

432
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Stop saying, eh?

433
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
But that project, or that corner,

434
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,000
You're the one who's supposed to scare the dark side of me.

435
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Well, if it's someone else...

436
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:51,000
No, no, when you're the one who's talking, why don't you say that you're scared?

437
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
I thought I was okay at that time.

438
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Right?

439
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Why are you scared?

440
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Please enter the stage.

441
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:07,000
The court is now in session.

442
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Please announce the verdict.

443
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
The court has done nothing but reflect on its actions.

444
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
It has caused many people trouble.

445
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
It is a hard-to-tolerate fact.

446
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Therefore, there is no room for explanation.

447
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
The verdict is the human breaker's punishment.

448
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,000
I'm sorry.

449
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
There is electricity over there.

450
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
In that room, the bedroom, right?

451
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Yes, that's right.

452
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Ah! Ah! No!

453
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Someone help!

454
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
No!

455
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
No!

456
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Please forgive me.

457
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Please, please.

458
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Please.
