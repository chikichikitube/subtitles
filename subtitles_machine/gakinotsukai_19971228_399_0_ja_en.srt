00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Chiki Chiki Staff Exhibition, Let's all make it together, Gaki Kalender 98!

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
What about this time?

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
This time, simply, let's make a calendar for next year from January to December.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I see.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
That's what we're going to do.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
We're going to go and bake what we've made.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Bake it?

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
It's bad manners.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Well, we should've made it.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
We should've had it baked in a temple.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Since it's a calendar, it should be from January to December.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Yes, yes, yes.

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
We need a model for that.

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
This member should be in it.

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
This member should be in it.

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
If it's not enough, the staff should be in it too.

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
That can't be helped.

18
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Yes.

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
There's going to be a hard month for a month, right?

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
A hard month.

21
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
There's going to be a really hard month.

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Right?

23
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
If you say that, it's going to be a hard month from January on.

24
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
There we go.

25
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
There we go.

26
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
There we go.

27
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
There we go.

28
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
This program is brought to you by these sponsors.

29
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Well, let's go.

30
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
There's only this person here.

31
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
He's our staff member for January.

32
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Oh, really?

33
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Since it's January, you're an octopus.

34
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Yes.

35
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
If it's done well, we're going to make a calendar and give it to the viewers.

36
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Yes.

37
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Is it done?

38
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Yes.

39
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Can't I open my hands?

40
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Oh, like that?

41
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Yes.

42
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Come here.

43
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Make more faces.

44
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Make more faces.

45
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Make more faces.

46
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I can't do it.

47
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I'm an amateur.

48
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I can't do it.

49
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Make two different faces.

50
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Let's make more faces.

51
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Who's this?

52
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
He's a demon.

53
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Why are there so many Sakamoto-chan?

54
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
In February...

55
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Sakamoto-chan is in February too?

56
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Sakamoto-chan and Yamazaki.

57
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Oh, I see.

58
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Sakamoto-chan, you should eat.

59
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
You can't bite, can you?

60
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
What's wrong with your body?

61
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Yamazaki, you're wrong.

62
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Yamazaki, it's not this way.

63
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Yamazaki, your camera view is weird.

64
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Look at the demon.

65
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Look at the demon.

66
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
You're on the side.

67
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
That's why your nose position is wrong.

68
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
It's the opposite.

69
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Really?

70
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
You're really not used to making jokes.

71
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I think about it.

72
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Which way to draw the mole.

73
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
The side without the camera.

74
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
You're all the opposite.

75
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
The mole and nose are all the opposite.

76
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Cry once.

77
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Ouch!

78
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
At that moment...

79
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Go away, demon.

80
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Is this all in March?

81
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
In March, there's a festival.

82
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Four unique characters start shooting.

83
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
The picture is good.

84
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:51,000
The picture is good.

85
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Yanaoka is ugly.

86
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
This is the first time I've seen Yanaoka like that.

87
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
It's really funny.

88
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
It's funny.

89
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
It's ugly.

90
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I can't lose to him.

91
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
It's ugly.

92
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
It's ugly.

93
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Tanaka, let's make a voice.

94
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Yes.

95
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Hurry up.

96
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Yanaoka, don't say anything.

97
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Yanaoka, you can't make a voice.

98
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Stop it.

99
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Yanaoka, let's make a voice.

100
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Yanaoka, let's make a voice.

101
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Yanaoka, let's make a voice.

102
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Yanaoka, let's make a voice.

103
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Yanaoka, look at the camera.

104
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Make a voice.

105
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Make a voice.

106
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Make a voice.

107
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Yanaoka, let's make a voice.

108
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Next is Hama born in May.

109
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
It's funny.

110
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
It's funny.

111
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Let's go.

112
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
It's funny.

113
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
It's funny.

114
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
It's funny.

115
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Is that you?

116
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
If it's me, there's no bear.

117
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
There's only one person in May.

118
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Let's leave the bear.

119
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
It's not his birthday or anything.

120
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Who is the bear?

121
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Who?

122
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
You're in trouble.

123
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I'm sorry.

124
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I'm sorry.

125
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I'm sorry.

126
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I think it's good that I won.

127
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
That's a little different.

128
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
That's a little different.

129
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
That's a little different.

130
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Look over there.

131
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Over there.

132
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Yes, yes.

133
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
No, no, no, no, no.

134
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I was taken by the string.

135
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
It's a post-it.

136
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Who is this?

137
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Kirika.

138
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Okay, okay, okay.

139
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
It's Sato Koichiro.

140
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Sato Koichiro.

141
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
It's going to cost a lot of money.

142
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
You're doing a good job.

143
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
What's this?

144
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
It's covered with a big one.

145
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
It's covered with a big one.

146
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
He's breaking his head in the middle.

147
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
That's a good one.

148
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
That's a good one.

149
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
That's a good one.

150
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Here we go.

151
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Roar, bear, roar.

152
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Roar, bear, roar.

153
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Roar.

154
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Did you get it?

155
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Roar.

156
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Who is this?

157
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
It's covered with a big one.

158
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Roar, bear, roar.

159
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Roar, bear, roar.

160
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
It's not a horse.

161
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
It's a human.

162
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
No matter how you look at it.

163
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Roar.

164
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
It's still covered with a big one.

165
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
It's still covered with a big one.

166
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Let's take a picture.

167
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
June Pride in June.

168
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
It's ugly.

169
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
It's scary.

170
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
It's ugly up to here.

171
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
It's a muhen.

172
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
If you kill it.

173
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
If you kill it, it's a muhen.

174
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Laugh.

175
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Don't laugh.

176
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Laugh more.

177
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Laugh more.

178
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
It's scary.

179
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
It's scary.

180
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
It's scary.

181
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
It's scary.

182
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
It's scary.

183
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
It's scary.

184
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
It's scary.

185
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
It's scary.

186
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
It's scary.

187
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I envy your face.

188
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
If I was born again, I would have this face.

189
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
They look alike in some way.

190
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Speak.

191
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Hey.

192
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
It didn't work in July?

193
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
But these two.

194
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Why are these two here?

195
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I don't know.

196
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
They are Orihime and Hikoboshi.

197
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
But they can't bite each other.

198
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Do it.

199
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Do it properly.

200
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Don't fight.

201
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Do it properly.

202
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
In August, there is a watermelon party at the beach in the middle of summer.

203
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:35,000
It's a situation where a crab that got caught in the water gets hit by a muhen.

204
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
It looks more like a crab.

205
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Really?

206
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
It's true.

207
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
It's true.

208
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
It's true.

209
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
You can see it a little, right?

210
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
It doesn't matter who it is.

211
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
In September, Machan finally appears.

212
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Matsumoto-san.

213
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Yes.

214
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Take this.

215
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Wait a minute.

216
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
From this side.

217
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Please jump here.

218
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I'll jump.

219
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,000
If you jump like this, you will be in the same place as the moon.

220
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I see.

221
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I see.

222
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
You can do it in one shot, right?

223
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
That's right.

224
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Let's do it.

225
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Really?

226
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Really.

227
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Is that so?

228
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I'm really sorry.

229
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
What?

230
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I can't do this.

231
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Do it more.

232
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Yamazaki, show us.

233
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Please.

234
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Come from here.

235
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
You want me to do this much, right?

236
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Show us something strange.

237
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Yes.

238
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Fight!

239
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Try jumping.

240
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
More, more, more.

241
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Jump more. Why can't you jump?

242
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Jump more.

243
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Personally, I jump a lot.

244
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
No, you don't.

245
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Just try it.

246
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I can't do it.

247
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Like this.

248
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
That's right.

249
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
That's right.

250
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
That's right.

251
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Dangerous.

252
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Dangerous. You're working too hard.

253
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Do you have a set?

254
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Do you have a set?

255
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Let's use this one in September.

256
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Wait a minute.

257
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Wait a minute.

258
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Let me use this one.

259
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Let's go.

260
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Let's go.

261
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Laugh. Laugh.

262
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Laugh.

263
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Laugh.

264
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Laugh.

265
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Laugh.

266
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Don't say no.

267
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Please.

268
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Say no. Say no.

269
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Say no.

270
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Please.

271
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Please.

272
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Please.

273
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Please.

274
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Please.

275
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
My sweat is sticky.

276
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Mago-san, please.

277
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Doctor.

278
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I'm sorry. Please.

279
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
What if I fall down this time?

280
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
What if I fall down this time?

281
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
You're falling down.

282
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
You're falling down.

283
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Alright.

284
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Alright.

285
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Okay. Okay. Okay.

286
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
You're crazy.

287
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
October is an active image of the autumn sports festival.

288
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Snap expressed a piece of obstacle relay.

289
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Snap.

290
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
November.

291
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,000
An old lady is gathering in Urayama with the image of the deepening autumn.

292
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
There are a lot of people in December.

293
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
There are three of us.

294
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Yes.

295
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
So, I'll introduce you.

296
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Takahashi Oishi. Kuranosuke.

297
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Okamoto is Kira.

298
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Kira.

299
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
He looks like a bad guy.

300
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Fujiwara is Horime Yasuke.

301
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Fujiwara is Horime Yasuke.

302
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
The fat of the liver is coming out.

303
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
This kid is funny.

304
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
This kid is funny.

305
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
But there's nothing to do.

306
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
That's right.

307
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
This kid is not funny at all.

308
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Hey, Fujiwara-san.

309
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Do you want me to dress you up?

310
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Do you want me to dress you up?

311
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
That's a real face.

312
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I tried to cut it.

313
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Are you ready?

314
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Kira is normal.

315
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
You have a more nasty face when you're booking.

316
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
You have a face when you refuse to do something.

317
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Unfortunately...

318
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Covered in full face.

319
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Hey Fujiwara,

320
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
please look at the camera.

321
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
He just said Gero-Gero.

322
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
It's Circe who changes.

323
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
That's funny.

324
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Today's opening was a bit long.

325
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Oh, I see.

326
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I could have cut the talk, but I didn't.

327
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
You should have come out and stopped me!

328
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I've been angry since last week.

329
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
You should have come out and stopped me!

330
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
You should have come out and stopped me!

331
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
No, that's not it.

332
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I'll tell you why I did the talk today.

333
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
You see, everyone is worried about Hamada-kun's health.

334
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
That's where my kindness comes out.

335
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Hamada-chan, Hamada-chan, who are you?

336
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
That room just now, isn't that Hamada-chan?

337
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I don't want to talk about the accident.

338
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
You don't want to talk about it?

339
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
You don't want to talk about it?

340
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I didn't know anything about the accident.

341
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Oh, really?

342
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
It was on Saturday, right? When was it?

343
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Friday night.

344
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Friday night?

345
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
In the morning.

346
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I had a job on Saturday.

347
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Yes, yes.

348
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
When I had a job on Saturday, who was it?

349
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Oh, it was Okamoto.

350
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
He came over.

351
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I didn't know anything about it.

352
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
He said, Hamada-san, it's okay.

353
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
What?

354
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I didn't know anything about it.

355
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
He suddenly said, Hamada-san, it's okay.

356
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I didn't know anything about it.

357
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I thought, there's nothing to worry about.

358
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Why? I didn't know anything.

359
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
There's nothing to worry about.

360
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
There's nothing to worry about for someone like Hamada.

361
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
He said, Hamada-san, it's okay.

362
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I said, what?

363
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Why is it okay?

364
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
He got angry.

365
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I didn't know anything about it.

366
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I was sleeping.

367
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I heard a noise.

368
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I was covered in glass.

369
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
It was pretty amazing.

370
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
It was amazing.

371
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I wondered what it was.

372
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
When I woke up, it was windy.

373
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
All the windows were broken.

374
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I thought you did it.

375
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
You did it.

376
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I thought you did it.

377
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
No matter how you think about it, it's like a foreign car.

378
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
You look like a foreign car.

379
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I thought it was you.

380
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
You look like a foreign car too.

381
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
No, you look more like a foreign car.

382
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
No, you look more like a foreign car.

383
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
When you're on TV, you're a talent.

384
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
You're very attentive.

385
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:51,000
But when you're done, you're like a foreign car.

386
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
You're very frivolous.

387
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
When you're done, you're frivolous.

388
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I don't know what to say.

389
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I'm saying this because I wasn't on the show.

390
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
What do you mean?

391
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I didn't get on the show, so that's what happened.

392
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
You didn't get on the show, so the accident happened.

393
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Yes.

394
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Why?

395
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I have a lot of fear.

396
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I'm like your god of poverty.

397
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I'm holding you back.

398
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I'm holding you back.

399
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I'm carrying a lot of things.

400
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
I have a different aura.

401
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I can't do anything about you.

402
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
What?

403
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
You're not being protected.

404
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
The woman behind you is a Mongolian.

405
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I'm not a Mongolian.

406
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I can't do anything about it.

407
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I'm not a normal Mongolian.

408
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I'm a tempura.

409
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
You're being cooked even more.

410
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I'm being cooked even more.

411
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
And I'm a little cold.

412
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I'm being cooked even more.

413
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I can't do anything about it.

414
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
If I'm there, I'll protect you.

415
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
If you're there with me, you're being protected.

416
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
You have to be more careful.

417
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I see.

418
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I'm not a Mongolian.

419
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Are you a good person?

420
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I'm a good person.

421
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I'm Elibis Presley.

422
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Elibis Presley.

423
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Elibis Presley.

424
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Elibis Presley and Bob Marley are mine.

425
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Matsumoto-san once made a new opening song for Talk.

426
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
It was very popular.

427
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Did you have one?

428
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I had one.

429
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
What are you talking about?

430
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I had a lot of them.

431
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Please make a new opening song for Talk.

432
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
What about the previous one?

433
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
No, I can't.

434
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
That's where I am.

435
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
That's not a song.

436
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
It's not a song.

437
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
No, that's where I am.

438
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
That's no good.

439
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
This is hard to sing.

440
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I can't sing.

441
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
It's over?

442
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
No matter how many times I hear it, I can't help but drink.

443
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
You can't help but drink.

444
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
You can't help but drink.

445
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
You can't help but drink.

446
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
So, please make a new song.

447
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I'll make a new song.

448
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
This is the last one for this year.

449
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Next year?

450
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Next year, I'll make a new song.

451
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,000
If you make a new song here, it'll be recorded.

452
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
It'll be soon.

453
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
OK, OK.

454
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Are you OK?

455
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I like that.

456
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I like the simple feeling.

457
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
If you're ready, I'll sing.

458
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Are you OK?

459
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
OK, I understand.

460
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I'll make a new opening song.

461
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Everyone, please be quiet.

462
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
This is a recording.

463
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Who's talking?

464
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I'm going in, so I can't talk.

465
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I can't talk.

466
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

467
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Please do it.

468
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
OK, I understand.

469
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Make a decision.

470
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
If you make a decision, it'll be soon.

471
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
OK, I understand.

472
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Are you ready?

473
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
It's close.

474
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
This is the second year.

475
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Mic.

476
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
OK, OK.

477
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I'll sing a foreign song.

478
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Are you ready?

479
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Yes.

480
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
5 seconds.

481
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
4, 3, 2, 1.

482
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Buse shibon.

483
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Matcha matcha shibon.

484
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Can you lower this?

485
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
I'll sing a foreign song.

486
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Please.

487
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
It's OK now.

488
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
What's shibon?

489
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
I've heard this in Osaka.

490
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
It's a performance in the middle of the night.

491
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Please do it.

492
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Don't look this way.

493
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I understand.

494
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Let's change.

495
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
It's different now.

496
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Are you ready?

497
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Yes.

498
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
5 seconds.

499
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
4, 3, 2, 1.

500
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Bagachiko.

501
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Bagachiko.

502
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Why are you laughing?

503
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
I'm not laughing.

504
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Why are you laughing?

505
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
5 seconds.

506
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Do it like a black dream.

507
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
What?

508
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Do it like a black dream.

509
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
5 seconds.

510
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
There's a way to do it like a black dream.

511
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
If you do this.

512
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
It's a song in the opening.

513
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
It's not about how to enter.

514
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
It's not about how to enter.

515
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
It's not about how to enter.

516
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
It's OK if it's a visual.

517
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
It's OK if it's a visual.

518
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
If it's a singing style, it's OK to enter.

519
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Please.

520
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Let's go.

521
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
5, 4, 3, 2...

522
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Bagachiko.

523
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Bagachiko.

524
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Bagachiko.

525
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Bagachiko.

526
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Yes, Machan is Bagachiko.

527
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Machan shouldn't be Bagachiko.

528
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Bagachiko.

529
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Bagachiko.

530
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Machan shouldn't be Bagachiko.

531
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Mebachiko.

532
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Mebachiko.

533
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Mebachiko.

534
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,620
You are laughs

535
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:49,560
Bang!

536
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,920

00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:57,080
Another

540
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,620
Cut

541
00:21:58,620 --> 00:21:59,440
You're laughs

542
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,920

You are laughs

547

I can't get into it.

560
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:09,700
I did it because I couldn't.

561
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:10,700
No, no.

562
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:11,700
Bang, bang, bang, bang.

563
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:14,700
There's something about the previous song.

564
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:17,700
If you put it out, it's amazing.

565
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:22,700
I'll say it clearly, but Okuda Tamio is frustrated right now.

566
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:24,700
Ah, so this is what happened.

567
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:27,700
It's a new genre.

568
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:32,700
A man and a woman who fell in love are opposed by their parents, but they still want to be together.

569
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:38,700
It's a song that has the image of running away.

570
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:42,700
In the song, Machan is stupid.

571
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:44,700
Eh?

572
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:46,700
It has something to do with it.

573
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:49,700
Machan, please support our love.

574
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:52,700
Hana-chan, please support our love.

575
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:54,700
Stupid.

576
00:23:54,700 --> 00:24:00,700
My dad is not stupid.
