1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
What was the first time you went to a bathhouse?

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Do you remember?

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
What do you mean?

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I think it was...

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I think it was when I was in 12th or 13th grade

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
That's so old!

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Tell us!

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
You two went to a bathhouse together, right?

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Yes, yes

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I've been there a few times, so I don't remember

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
At that time, an old man with a razor came in

12
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
At the bathhouse...

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
There's a place where it flows, right?

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
There's a well

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
There's a shower

16
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
There was an old man sitting there

17
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
He was like, this isn't it!

18
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
This isn't it!

19
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
And he was cutting potatoes, right?

20
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
He wanted to cut potatoes

21
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
He was cutting potatoes

22
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,000
We two were in a culture shop

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
There's a culture shop?

24
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Do they have that kind of thing?

25
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
That's right

26
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
The water was flowing

27
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
This isn't it!

28
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
This isn't it!

29
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
That's what he said

30
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
You've been there, right?

31
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Yes, yes, I remember

32
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Since then, time has been separated

33
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Separated?

34
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
It's been 25 years, right?

35
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I...

36
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I've done it

37
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
So...

38
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I can understand how that old man felt

39
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
That old man and I...

40
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
We've been together for a long time

41
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
What do you mean, this isn't it?

42
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Why do you think this isn't it?

43
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
At that time, I didn't understand the meaning

44
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
It was like a sci-fi world

45
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
That old man

46
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
It was like a space fantasy

47
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
It wasn't a fantasy

48
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Now, I understand

49
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
The other day, I did it

50
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Why did you do it?

51
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
How did you feel when you did it?

52
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
It was too long

53
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
That's not what you ask an old man

54
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Why do you ask an old man?

55
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I didn't say that it was too long

56
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I think that old man...

57
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I think that old man...

58
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Your feelings are different

59
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I don't need to talk to that old man

60
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
That old man and I

61
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Too long?

62
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
What do you mean?

63
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Tell me how long it was

64
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
What's long?

65
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
It's completely long

66
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
That's right

67
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:23,000
It was like a press release

68
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

69
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I think your retina is going crazy.

70
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I never thought it was going to be this long.

71
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I think it's going to be here soon.

72
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I don't know how old you all are, but if you're 40, it's going to be crazy.

73
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Your retina is going crazy.

74
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I don't know how your retina is going to be this long.

75
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I don't know how long it's going to be.

76
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
It's amazing.

77
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
It's really amazing.

78
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Is it in the way?

79
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
It's really in the way.

80
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
It's long.

81
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
It's in the way.

82
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
It's going crazy.

83
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I always read a book before I go to bed.

84
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I put my pillow on my bed and read a book.

85
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I don't know what women think, but I'm doing this.

86
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I'm doing this.

87
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I'm doing this.

88
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I go to the bathroom and say,

89
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
This is what it looks like.

90
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
This is what it looks like.

91
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Old man.

92
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I don't think you should call me an old man.

93
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Thank you, old man.

94
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Sorry, old man.

95
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
It's okay, old man.

96
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
There's something I want to ask you.

97
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
What is it?

98
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
People who live in mansions.

99
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I've been curious about it for a long time.

100
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
There's a poster, right?

101
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Right?

102
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
On the dial.

103
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
662.

104
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
114.

105
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
It's usually like that. Left, left, right, right, right, left.

106
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
What should I do with that?

107
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
What do you mean?

108
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
For example, if it's 221.

109
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Where does it start?

110
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
If it's 221.

111
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
If it's stopped at 2.

112
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
That's 2.

113
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I'm just worried.

114
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
But it depends on the model.

115
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
If there's a model that tells you to put it back to zero.

116
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Then I have to try it once.

117
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
So.

118
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
It's 2.

119
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
It's 2 on the left.

120
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
If you stop it, it's no good, right?

121
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
If you stop at 5 on the way, it's no good, right?

122
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:10,000
So, until the next 2.

123
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
It's no good, it's no good, it's no good.

124
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
No, no, I didn't say it. I didn't say it.

125
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
But I didn't hear you say it.

126
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
So, 2.

127
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
2.

128
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
1.

129
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Well, every time you open it, it's okay.

130
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
What are you guys doing?

131
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I don't know.

132
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I don't know at all.

133
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
So, until now, you've been opening it like that, right?

134
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Until now, I don't really know what happened.

135
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
It's like the joints are a little weird.

136
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I managed to get through it somehow.

137
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Then you should do that from now on.

138
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:56,000
But I can't stand it anymore.

139
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
If you say it so strongly, I want to do something about it.

140
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
You can explain it properly.

141
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
You can do it through the program.

142
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
No, no, no.

143
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
It's just a picture of a crab.

144
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
But I don't want to explain it to you like this.

145
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I don't like it if you don't like it.

146
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I don't like it if you don't like it.

147
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
It's going to be like this.

148
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
No, that tension.

149
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
No, no, no, no.

150
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
That's the tension of the explanation.

151
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
It's because you say it like that.

152
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
That's why it's cool.

153
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
No, it's going to be like this.

154
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
It's going to be like this.

155
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
You should say it with a low tone.

156
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Well, that's right.

157
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
There are a lot of people who don't understand.

158
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
No, that's not true.

159
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I'm sure everyone is listening, so they're just opening it up.

160
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
No way.

161
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
There's no one else in the neighborhood who's like this, right?

162
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I don't think so.

163
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
That's right.

164
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
You're the one who's always been caught.

165
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Hey.

166
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
No, no, no.

167
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I was tapped.

168
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

169
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
No, I think there are people who understand.

170
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Is there anyone like that at home?

171
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Look, there are.

172
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
There are so many.

173
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Then tell me.

174
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
What do you want me to do?

175
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Why?

176
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Don't talk to me.

177
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I don't like it.

178
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Why don't you talk to me?

179
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Don't talk to me.

180
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
If you go to the right, it's the next left.

181
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Even if you stop, it's up to that number.

182
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Little by little.

183
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
If you go to the right, it's definitely not left.

184
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Right, left, left.

185
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Right, left, right.

186
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
No, no, no.

187
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Left, left, right.

188
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
You just have to go over that number twice.

189
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I've already told you.

190
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Then let's ask over there.

191
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Wait a minute.

192
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
You just have to go over that number twice.

193
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Shut up.

194
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I don't know, so I'll just stay here.

195
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
You're from the countryside.

196
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
That's good.

197
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Well, the intonation is good.

198
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
You didn't open it?

199
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Put your hand in and take it out.

200
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
That's good.

201
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
That's right.

202
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I don't know.

203
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Hurry up.

204
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I don't know.

205
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I'm curious.

206
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
You can take it out with your hand.

207
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
You can take it out with your hand.

208
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I don't know if I can take it out with my hand.

209
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Is that a tongue twister?

210
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Pen name Hanpenkozo.

211
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I have a question for Matsumoto-san, who has been the subject of many masterpieces.

212
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I heard that it was Matsumoto-san who stole the motorcycle from Yutaka Ozaki.

213
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
After that, I heard that Matsumoto-san also dealt with it.

214
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
What the hell did you do?

215
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Was that your motorcycle?

216
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I was surprised.

217
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I bought a book at a bookstore.

218
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I went to the bookstore with a motorcycle and stopped it.

219
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I was surprised.

220
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I ran away.

221
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I ran away.

222
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
You stole it.

223
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I stole it completely.

224
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I chased him saying, what are you doing?

225
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I was going to stop.

226
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I asked him, what are you doing?

227
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
He wasn't honest.

228
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I asked him to apologize.

229
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I don't want to apologize.

230
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
You are crazy.

231
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:02,000
What am I?

232
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I don't know.

233
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I don't want to be criticized.

234
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
You are noisy.

235
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
You are noisy.

236
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
You were crazy.

237
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
You took it back by force.

238
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
It was a big hit.

239
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
When I heard that song, I was surprised.

240
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
It was my motorcycle.

241
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:37,000
It's a terrible story.

242
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
My pen name is Komatsu.

243
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Matsumoto knows all the games in the world.

244
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Tell me your favorite Russian game.

245
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
There are many.

246
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
How many people can I play with?

247
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Let's play with two people.

248
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Let's play with two people.

249
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:11,000
OK.

250
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I lost 20 points.

251
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I can't win.

252
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I can't win no matter how many times I play.

253
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Let's play again.

254
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Don't do it.

255
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I'm kidding.

256
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
It's easy to understand.

257
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Rock-paper-scissors.

258
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I don't say rock-paper-scissors.

259
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I say it in Russian.

260
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
You don't understand.

261
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Say it in Russian.

262
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I don't care.

263
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Rock-paper-scissors.

264
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:19,000
You win.

265
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I lost.

266
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I lose.

267
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I see.

268
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I'm going to run away.

269
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Please follow me.

270
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:40,000
If you touch me, you lose.

271
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Which is better?

272
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Rock-paper-scissors.

273
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I don't explain the rules.

274
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I think it's better to do it.

275
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I'll chase you.

276
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Why are you chasing me?

277
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Because you won.

278
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Who are you chasing?

279
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Borscht.

280
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Borscht is because I lost.

281
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Do you understand?

282
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
If you touch me, who are you?

283
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Borscht.

284
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Borscht is Borscht.

285
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
If you touch me, I'm Borscht.

286
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I'm not Borscht anymore.

287
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
No.

288
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I'm Borscht's Borscht.

289
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I don't understand.

290
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I don't understand Borscht and Borscht.

291
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I can't play this game.

292
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Why don't you try it?

293
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Hiroshiki...

294
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
What are you doing?

295
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Borscht touched by Hiroshiki can't move for a while.

296
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Then what should I do?

297
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,000
If I play with a group of people, I can't find the next one.

298
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
It can't be helped.

299
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
It's not a game for two people.

300
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
That's right.

301
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
If you don't do it, you won't be able to stand up.

302
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
It can't be helped.

303
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
There are only two of us.

304
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Let's go.

305
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:49,000
There's no place to run.

306
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I'm sorry.

307
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Are you okay?

308
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Are you okay?

309
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Are you okay?

310
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Are you okay?

311
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Are you okay?

312
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Can't you do it anymore?

313
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Wake up.

314
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:52,000
What kind of game is this?

315
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I have a question for Matsumoto-san, the honorary chairman of the Japanese Greeting Association.

316
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Yes.

317
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,000
It is said that the most used word among Japanese people is sorry.

318
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
That's right.

319
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
What is the 14th used word?

320
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
These are all ranked.

321
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Is that so?

322
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Yes.

323
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
The fact that I'm sorry is the first place.

324
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I think it's a good thing and a sad thing for Japanese people.

325
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I see.

326
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Please tell me the 14th.

327
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Can I just say the 14th?

328
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
If you can, please tell me in the meantime.

329
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I'll tell you.

330
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
The second place is...

331
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Isn't there an M for this?

332
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
The first place is sorry, right?

333
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
The second place is...

334
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Isn't there an M for this?

335
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Normally, if there is an excuse, someone can say hello.

336
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I say it unexpectedly.

337
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
How are you doing?

338
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
How are you doing?

339
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
The third place is how are you doing?

340
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:56,000
There is no M for this between sorry and how are you doing.

341
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I don't remember what I said.

342
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Think about it. How many times do you say there is no M for this?

343
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I don't know.

344
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
You say it a lot.

345
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I can't do it.

346
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
How about the fourth place?

347
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
The fourth place is normal.

348
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,000
It's small.

349
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
What about the fifth place?

350
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
The fifth place?

351
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:29,000
It depends on the decision.

352
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Really?

353
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
It depends on the decision.

354
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
The fifth place?

355
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Then you go down and tell me about the tenth place.

356
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
The tenth place is how are you doing?

357
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
How are you doing?

358
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
The Japanese say it.

359
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I say it unexpectedly.

360
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I didn't notice it myself.

361
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
It depends on the decision.

362
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
The fifth place.

363
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I want to hear about the 14th place.

364
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Then tell me about the 10th place to the 13th place.

365
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
The 10th place is how are you doing?

366
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
The 10th place is how are you doing?

367
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Then tell me about the 11th, 12th, and 13th place.

368
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:08,000
The 11th place is...

369
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
It's like a greeting meeting.

370
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:19,000
What are you doing?

371
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Tell me!

372
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Tell me something!

373
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
There is a slight difference.

374
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Including all of that.

375
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Then the 11th?

376
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
The 12th?

377
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
The 12th?

378
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
The 13th?

379
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
You're going back to the starting point.

380
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Of course.

381
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
The 13th place is...

382
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:48,000
It's still moving.

383
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
The one before that is...

384
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I don't know about that.

385
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I can't accept this.

386
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
It's the 14th place.

387
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Do you want to go to the 14th place?

388
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
If you don't ask that...

389
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Then tell me about the 15th place.

390
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
The 15th place?

391
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I want to hear about the 14th place.

392
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Then tell me about the 15th place.

393
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:14,000
The 15th place is...

394
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,000
The 15th place is...

395
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
The 15th place?

396
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Everyone, you might not like this.

397
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I want to talk about pomeranians.

398
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
It might be good.

399
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
It can't be helped.

400
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
It's not like that.

401
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
It can't be helped.

402
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
It can't be helped.

403
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Then the 14th place.

404
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
The 14th place?

405
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
The 14th place is...

406
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:45,000
It changed to the one before that.

407
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:50,000
This is the 29th place.

408
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
That's right.

409
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I think I was waiting for this.

410
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
It's changing.

411
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I think so.

412
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Let's start again.

413
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
No, no.

414
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Let's start again.

415
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
What's the 1st place?

416
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I'm sorry.

417
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I'm sorry.

418
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
It's this year.

419
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
This year?

420
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Yes.

421
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
What's the 2nd place?

422
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Isn't there an M for this?

423
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
That's right.

424
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
What's the 3rd place?

425
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
How are you?

426
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
How are you?

427
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
What's the 4th place?

428
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
It's small.

429
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
What's the 5th place?

430
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
It depends on the decision.

431
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
What's the 10th place?

432
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
What's the 11th place?

433
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I didn't say the 12th place.

434
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
What's the 13th place?

435
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
It's still moving.

436
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
That's right.

437
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
What should I do?

438
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
You can say the 12th place.

439
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
The 12th place is...

440
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
The 12th place is...

441
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
It's finally...

442
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
It's finally moving somewhere.

443
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:56,000
What are you doing?

444
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Who said that?

445
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
You can't say that.

446
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Let's fill in the blanks.

447
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Right?

448
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Yes.

449
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
6, 7, 8, 9.

450
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Say it.

451
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
6 is...

452
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Cameloon is slow.

453
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Cameloon is slow.

454
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
7 is?

455
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:24,000
That's 14.

456
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
What?

457
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Cameloon representative is slow.

458
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:33,000
That's funny.

459
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
That's 14?

460
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I think that's the 14th place.

461
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Really?

462
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
6, 7, 8.

463
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Say it and remember it.

464
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
What's the 7th place?

465
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
The 7th place is...

466
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Thin noodles.

467
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
I knew it. Thin noodles.

468
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
That's the 12th place.

469
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
This is the 14th place.

470
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
That's right.

471
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Say something nice.

472
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
The 7th place is thin noodles.

473
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
And the 14th place is...

474
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Thin noodles.

475
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
So that's the 14th place?

476
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Yes.

477
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
8 and 9 are left.

478
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
They're left.

479
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
That's gross.

480
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
It's not like that at all.

481
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
What's the 8th place?

482
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Nishikino.

483
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
The 8th place is Nishikino.

484
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Nishikino, it's you.

485
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
What's the 9th place?

486
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:42,000
The 9th place is thin noodles.

487
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
That's the end.

488
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
That's good, right?

489
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Yes.

490
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Is it over?

491
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
It's over. It's all over.

492
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I felt like Nishikino slipped.

493
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
It's not bad at all.

494
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:58,000
It's not good to show your real self here.

495
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Then let's go home.

496
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:06,000
That's the 79th place.

497
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
It's really the D cup?

498
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
It's the next one.

499
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:21,000
This program was provided by the following sponsors.
