1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Ladies and gentlemen...

2
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,500
After 24 hours...

3
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:14,500
It looks like it's going to break today.

4
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:17,500
After 24 hours of TV, this program is over.

5
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,500
That's how it is.

6
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,500
24 hours was hard, wasn't it?

7
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,500
You were crying.

8
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:26,500
Oh, really?

9
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:27,500
It's that time of the year?

10
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,500
It's that time of the year.

11
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,500
It's that time of the year, isn't it?

12
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:32,500
The titans...

13
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:33,500
Yes, yes, the titans.

14
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,500
...became fans.

15
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:36,500
What did you say?

16
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,500
What?

17
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:39,500
You're not interested in baseball?

18
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,500
No, I'm not.

19
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,500
What do you like?

20
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,500
I used to like Chunichi.

21
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,500
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

22
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:48,500
Now you like Chunichi.

23
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:49,500
I like Chunichi.

24
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,500
When I was in elementary school, if there wasn't a club I liked,

25
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,500
I wouldn't be able to play against them.

26
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:58,500
Well, everyone likes baseball.

27
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:59,500
That's right.

28
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:02,500
So I forced myself to like Chunichi.

29
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:05,500
You're wearing Chunichi's hat while saying that.

30
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:06,500
Yes, yes, yes.

31
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:09,500
I kept saying that I liked him.

32
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:10,500
And then...

33
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:14,500
After I left school, Shakutani transferred to my school.

34
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:16,500
That's good.

35
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:19,500
I had to apologize for that.

36
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:20,500
Why?

37
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,500
It doesn't matter.

38
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:26,500
But there was a player called Matsumoto.

39
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:29,500
Matsumoto Rukitsura.

40
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:34,500
I really liked how he threw the ball at a very fast pace.

41
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:35,500
That's the only thing I remember.

42
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:36,500
It was amazing.

43
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,500
So there's a catcher, right?

44
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:42,500
If you throw it and there's a ball, it goes straight to the next one.

45
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:45,500
It was really amazing.

46
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:48,500
You should have thrown it slower with the catch ball.

47
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,500
Why?

48
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,500
That's what I thought.

49
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,500
It's a batter, right?

50
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:53,500
No, it's not a batter.

51
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:56,500
I liked him, but he's gone somewhere.

52
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,500
Oh, really?

53
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:58,500
He's not here, is he?

54
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,500
He's not here.

55
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,500
Maybe he was here in the past.

56
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,500
No, he was here.

57
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:03,500
I'm worried.

58
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,500
What's wrong with my brain?

59
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,500
That's right.

60
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:09,500
That's right.

61
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:10,500
Well, baseball is...

62
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,500
Well, I think baseball is...

63
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,500
Well, if you like baseball, you can like it.

64
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:20,500
You always play baseball, right?

65
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,500
That's right.

66
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:22,500
Well, it's usually until 9 o'clock.

67
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:23,500
It's 9 o'clock.

68
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:26,500
It's already 9 o'clock.

69
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:29,500
You should have started 30 minutes earlier.

70
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,500
So I'm making a reservation, but I don't want to see it.

71
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,500
Stop that.

72
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,500
No, no, no.

73
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:39,500
That's...

74
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,500
It's really annoying.

75
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:42,500
I rarely do that.

76
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:47,500
But when I come back after making a reservation, I don't want to see it.

77
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,500
I can't help it.

78
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,500
I often hear that kind of story.

79
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,500
I've been doing it since 9 o'clock.

80
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:52,500
It's been about two and a half hours.

81
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:57,500
If that's the case, you should have decided that the picture would end at 9 o'clock.

82
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,500
No matter how many times you do it.

83
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,500
Then you can get a lucky face again.

84
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,500
Because it's early.

85
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:04,500
I don't have a lucky face.

86
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,500
I don't have a lucky face.

87
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,500
I don't have a lucky face.

88
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,500
I'm sorry.

89
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,500
I didn't listen to you.

90
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,500
Right?

91
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:14,500
Don't you have any lucky faces?

92
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,500
Well, I don't care.

93
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,500
I don't care.

94
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,500
It's a broadcast situation.

95
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,500
That kind of show will be a big deal.

96
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,500
It's not a big deal.

97
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,500
It's about 30 minutes.

98
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,500
No, no, no.

99
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:31,500
So I want to make the late-night show one minute and one second faster.

100
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,500
But I'm doing it because I can only get a good picture.

101
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,500
Why is it a roll situation?

102
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,500
It's a roll situation.

103
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,500
Right?

104
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,500
That's the only show I can do.

105
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,500
That's why I'm broadcasting there.

106
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:47,500
If I can't do it in Golden, I'll do it from the beginning.

107
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,500
Huh?

108
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,500
All right, all right.

109
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,500
Wait a minute.

110
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,500
I'm going to ask you.

111
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,500
If you think so, switch on.

112
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,500
Wait a minute.

113
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,500
There's nothing on the page.

114
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,500
The atmosphere, the atmosphere.

115
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,500
I'm looking at the movement here.

116
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,500
I don't know if you're going to do it or not.

117
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,500
No, no, no.

118
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:07,500
That's not right.

119
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,500
That's funny.

120
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,500
I want to see it.

121
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,500
If you say you're going to extend the Aikyu broadcast as it is.

122
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,500
I think that's right.

123
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,500
I don't think so.

124
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,500
What are you going to do when it's over at a place like this?

125
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,500
What kind of place is this?

126
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,500
What's that?

127
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,500
I can't see Nagashima.

128
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,500
If that's the case, I'll do it a little more.

129
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,500
Nagashima.

130
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,500
Why don't you show Nagashima?

131
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,500
Nagashima is like this.

132
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,500
Wait a minute.

133
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,500
If you say it's over at 6 o'clock.

134
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,500
I'll call you.

135
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,500
What kind of sign is that?

136
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,500
Hey.

137
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,500
What kind of sign is it at 2 out of 10,000?

138
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,500
It's not similar.

139
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,500
Other than that.

140
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,500
I'm imitating Keisuke Kuwata right now.

141
00:04:54,500 --> 00:05:01,500
I've been doing it for a while, but it doesn't look like it.

142
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,500
Why is Keisuke Kuwata Keisuke?

143
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,500
Right now.

144
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,500
Right now.

145
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,500
It's halfway through, isn't it?

146
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,500
Like Sen Masao.

147
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,500
Right now.

148
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,500
Baah.

149
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,500
Baah.

150
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,500
It's like a croquette.

151
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,500
What kind of sign is that?

152
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,500
You can't do it at all, can you?

153
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,500
I can't.

154
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,500
Why?

155
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:35,500
My partner is doing this much.

156
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,500
We're eating the same amount of food.

157
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,500
Why can't you do it?

158
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,500
I can't.

159
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,500
Why?

160
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,500
You can't do anything, can you?

161
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,500
I can't.

162
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:56,500
You can't do it at all, can you?

163
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,500
Do it again.

164
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,500
I don't know what you're talking about.

165
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,500
You really can't do it, can you?

166
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,500
What's number 18?

167
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,500
Yumi.

168
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:12,500
That's the first time I've heard it.

169
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:16,500
I can't do it at all.

170
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,500
Next.

171
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,500
And Chuck.

172
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:24,500
Huh?

173
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:27,500
Chuck, Chuck.

174
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,500
Can you do that?

175
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,500
I can't do that.

176
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,500
San-san.

177
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,500
San-san.

178
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,500
Can you do that?

179
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,500
I can't do that.

180
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,500
Do something.

181
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,500
Teach me.

182
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,500
Okay, okay, okay.

183
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,500
I'm an impersonator teacher.

184
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,500
I'm an impersonator teacher.

185
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,500
Nice to meet you.

186
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,500
Nice to meet you.

187
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,500
I'm Yumi-san.

188
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,500
I'm Yumi-san.

189
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:53,500
You're like a CD player.

190
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,500
I think it's better to be a cool guy.

191
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,500
Let's go with the red sun.

192
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,500
The red sun?

193
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:05,500
Peperoncino is here.

194
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,500
Me?

195
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,500
Of course.

196
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,500
Who is it?

197
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,500
You told me.

198
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,500
I've been talking to you all the time.

199
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,500
Since the first broadcast.

200
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,500
Since before that.

201
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,500
What's Peperon?

202
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,500
Peperoncino is here.

203
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:30,500
Have you ever seen a show?

204
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,500
Excuse me.

205
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,500
Wait a minute.

206
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,500
You're late.

207
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,500
No.

208
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,500
I thought you were in the show.

209
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,500
Peperoncino is here.

210
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,500
You should have seen the situation.

211
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:47,500
You're one step late.

212
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,500
What did you do?

213
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,500
Peperoncino is here.

214
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,500
Okay, I got it.

215
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:55,500
Peperoncino is here.

216
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,500
Peperoncino is here.

217
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:00,500
Peperoncino is here.

218
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,500
Who are you?

219
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,500
Like this.

220
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,500
It's cold.

221
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:15,500
Peperoncino is here.

222
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:16,500
Who are you?

223
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,500
Is this okay?

224
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:21,500
I'm sorry.

225
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,500
I'll pay you back.

226
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:31,500
Matsumoto is the most famous fortune teller in the world.

227
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:32,500
Yes.

228
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:35,500
What is your profession?

229
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:39,500
I don't know my past life.

230
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:42,500
Have you ever done fortune telling?

231
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,500
Of course.

232
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,500
Before that?

233
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,500
Yes.

234
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,500
Tell me.

235
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,500
Me and Matsumoto.

236
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:51,500
I don't think you should ask.

237
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:54,500
It's dangerous.

238
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,500
Is it dangerous?

239
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,500
I don't care if it's dangerous.

240
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:59,500
I don't like it.

241
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,500
I'm depressed.

242
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,500
Are you depressed?

243
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,500
I'm depressed.

244
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,500
Are you depressed?

245
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,500
I'm depressed.

246
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,500
Tell me.

247
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:11,500
I knew you were doing that.

248
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,500
What?

249
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,500
I knew you were doing that.

250
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,500
Wait a minute.

251
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,500
You shouldn't have done that.

252
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,500
You knew that.

253
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,500
I knew it a long time ago.

254
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,500
Everyone knows my staff.

255
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:26,500
You're not here.

256
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:30,500
But you have a good atmosphere.

257
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,500
Tell me.

258
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,500
I don't care if I'm depressed.

259
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:39,500
Okay.

260
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:43,500
Don't be surprised.

261
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:49,500
Don't hate me.

262
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,500
I'm a bright red winner.

263
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:59,500
I'm a bright red winner.

264
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,500
I'm very depressed.

265
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,500
I'm very depressed.

266
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:16,500
I'm a bright red winner.

267
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,500
I'm a bright red winner.

268
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:21,500
I'm a bright red winner.

269
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,500
I don't eat.

270
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:29,500
I used to be told that you were a familiar in your previous life.

271
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:32,500
That was before that.

272
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:37,500
Before that, I used to put eggs in the refrigerator.

273
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,500
I shouldn't have said that.

274
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,500
That's the whole story.

275
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:51,500
I was doing that for the first few episodes.

276
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,500
That's the whole story.

277
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:56,500
But the winner is the third one.

278
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,500
The third one?

279
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,500
The middle one.

280
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,500
There are four below.

281
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:05,500
That was tough.

282
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,500
I'm sorry.

283
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,500
Who are you?

284
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,500
Who are you?

285
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,500
If I were a winner.

286
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:18,500
I used to say that I was a regent.

287
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,500
That's cool.

288
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,500
Where are you from?

289
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:27,500
Why are you doing this on someone's head?

290
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,500
That's enough.

291
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,500
I have a question for Mr. Matsumoto.

292
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,500
When I'm singing in karaoke,

293
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,500
but no one is listening to me,

294
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,500
what should I do to make them listen to me?

295
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,500
That's a good question.

296
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:48,500
When I'm singing in karaoke,

297
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,500
I can only see the people who are singing.

298
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:55,500
I can only see the people who are not singing.

299
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,500
It's not that sad.

300
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,500
That's true.

301
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:02,500
It's a matter of persuasion.

302
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,500
For example, what should I sing?

303
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,500
I'm praying.

304
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,500
You're praying?

305
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,500
How many times are you going to sing?

306
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,500
I can't think of anything.

307
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,500
That's fine.

308
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,500
What was it again?

309
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,500
I'm embarrassed.

310
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,500
It's because you're a regent.

311
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:34,500
Be careful of your health.

312
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,500
Seriously?

313
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,500
You're praying?

314
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,500
Seriously?

315
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:47,500
But the song is still going on.

316
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,500
It's okay.

317
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,500
It's okay to be late.

318
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:59,500
Be careful of your health.

319
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,500
Seriously?

320
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:09,500
Don't drink too much.

321
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,500
Seriously?

322
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,500
Seriously?

323
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,500
Seriously?

324
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,500
This song was good.

325
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:20,500
I'm glad I sang this song.
