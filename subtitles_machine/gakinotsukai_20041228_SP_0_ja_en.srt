1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:07,000
In the winter of 2004, another harsh punishment game was launched.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
There was only one rule.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
It was a one-night, two-day trip to a hot spring that you absolutely must not laugh at.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:26,000
If you laugh at the emotions given to humanity among all living things on Earth, and if you are taken away from that laughter...

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
...you will be punished by the 2003 punishment game.

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
And the ones who fell into hell this time were these men.

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Naoki Tanaka.

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Hosei Yamasaki.

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Masatoshi Hamada.

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
The one who controlled the fate of these three men was...

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
...Shouzo Endo.

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
And the man who was in charge of the punishment game was...

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
...Hitoshi Matsumoto.

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The memories engraved in the minds of these three men...

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
...were a one-night, two-day trip to hell.

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Just do it already!

17
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
It all started with this match.

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
The first time, near the Gaki no Tsukai.

19
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Gaki Shijo's first genius boy, Yamasaki Hatsun.

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I don't know how many people will be punished.

21
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Wasabi Sushi Russian Roulette Match!

22
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
The genius boy, Yamasaki Hatsun's Wasabi Sushi Russian Roulette Match.

23
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,000
The punishment game is to eat four Wasabi Sushi out of 100 sushi.

24
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I don't know how many people will be punished for eating Wasabi Sushi in downtown.

25
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
The first one to be punished is...

26
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Come on!

27
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Don't be a middle-aged man.

28
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
That's enough.

29
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Tanaka, choose.

30
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Safe?

31
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I think it's safe.

32
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
It's safe.

33
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
What are you saying?

34
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Don't be a middle-aged man.

35
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Yamasaki Hatsun's punishment game!

36
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
The second one to be punished is...

37
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Safe?

38
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I think it's safe.

39
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
It's safe.

40
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
What? Tanaka?

41
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Tanaka, you're out!

42
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I thought it was safe.

43
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
And...

44
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I'm safe.

45
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
End safe.

46
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I'm safe.

47
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
We did it!

48
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
We did it!

49
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Hamada's punishment game is over!

50
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:30,000
The men who are chosen by the laughing devil will open the curtain.

51
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Thank you for watching the punishment game.

52
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
We won.

53
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Yes, we won.

54
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Shall we call the people to be punished?

55
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Yes, please.

56
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
How do you feel?

57
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I'm fine.

58
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
But I'm a little tired after the game.

59
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
What?

60
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
You must be tired.

61
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I was so excited that I couldn't speak.

62
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Why?

63
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I lost.

64
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,000
This is a long punishment game.

65
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:29,000
There are many punishments.

66
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

67
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I know what you're talking about.

68
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
You should say it.

69
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

70
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

71
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I was so busy that I had a runny nose.

72
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
You're all enemies.

73
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I can't help that.

74
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
You can't help that.

75
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
You're all enemies.

76
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Who can be on your side?

77
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I've never been so quiet.

78
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I was surprised.

79
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:13,000
It was 2 p.m. on the day of the punishment game.

80
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Three people got on the train and arrived at Yugahara Station.

81
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:22,000
This man was waiting for three people in this town.

82
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Hey.

83
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Hey.

84
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Hey.

85
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
You're so excited.

86
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I'm laughing now.

87
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Hey.

88
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Hey.

89
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
You're so excited.

90
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I'm laughing now.

91
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Do you know where this is?

92
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
This is Yugahara.

93
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
You're wrong.

94
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
You're wrong as a comedian.

95
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
You can't be funny.

96
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
You can't be funny.

97
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
You can't be funny.

98
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
You can't be funny.

99
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
It's a punishment game today.

100
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
You can't be funny.

101
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
It's a punishment game today.

102
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
And it's a goal.

103
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Where is your goal?

104
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I'll explain the rules of the punishment game.

105
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
One.

106
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Three people will go to a hot spring hotel for two days and one night.

107
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
One.

108
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
You can't laugh no matter what happens.

109
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
One.

110
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
If you laugh, you'll get a hard punishment.

111
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
That's all.

112
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Mr. Matsumoto gave me a simple rule for the stupid Hamada.

113
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Good for you, Hamada.

114
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
We're about to start the punishment game.

115
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Are you ready?

116
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
All right.

117
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
You can't be funny.

118
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
The punishment game will start when you laugh.

119
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
If I laugh, it's over.

120
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Follow me.

121
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
You can't be funny.

122
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Let's go.

123
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
You can't be funny.

124
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Let's go together.

125
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Let's go together.

126
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Is the hot spring close to the inn?

127
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,000
It's close to the inn, but it's close.

128
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Is that so?

129
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Yes.

130
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Look to the left.

131
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,000
The green of Yugawara is beautiful.

132
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Yugawara is beautiful.

133
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,000
The city is welcoming us.

134
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Look.

135
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Look.

136
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
This is amazing.

137
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
This is amazing.

138
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
This is amazing.

139
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
This is amazing.

140
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I'm really surprised.

141
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
This is amazing.

142
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Tanaka.

143
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
You can't be funny.

144
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
You can't be funny.

145
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
What?

146
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
What?

147
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
What?

148
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
What?

149
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
It hurts.

150
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
It hurts.

151
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
It hurts.

152
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
It hurts.

153
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
If this city doesn't cooperate, there will be no hole.

154
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
This is amazing.

155
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
What?

156
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
We arrived in Yugawara.

157
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Where?

158
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:04,000
What's wrong?

159
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
What is this?

160
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Wait a minute.

161
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Wait a minute.

162
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Wait a minute.

163
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Wait a minute.

164
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Wait a minute.

165
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Cool.

166
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Eun-vi.

167
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,000
1, 2, 3.

168
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Mister, Mister.

169
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Mister, Mister.

170
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Mister, Mister.

171
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Mister, Mister.

172
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Mister, Mister.

173
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Mister, Mister.

174
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I knew it!

175
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Hamada out!

176
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Yamasaki out!

177
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Ouch!

178
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Why did you get hit twice?

179
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Tanaka got hit so many times!

180
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
YWGP World Heavyweight Champion!

181
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,000
He is the number one star in the world heavyweight division!

182
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
What are you doing?

183
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
What are you doing?

184
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Thank you.

185
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
What are you doing?

186
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Mom! Mom! Mom!

187
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
He is funny.

188
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
He is amazing.

189
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
The kids in Yugawara are studying hard.

190
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I don't know anymore.

191
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Tanaka!

192
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
What are you doing?

193
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
What are you doing?

194
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Help me!

195
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
It's hard.

196
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Hamada!

197
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
What are you doing?

198
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I can't stand it.

199
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I can't stand it.

200
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Tanaka is amazing.

201
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
He is amazing.

202
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I can't stand it.

203
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Let's take a break.

204
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
It's a hot spring town in Yugawara.

205
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
We should go to a traditional confectionery shop.

206
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Let's have some tea.

207
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Sit down.

208
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Thank you.

209
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
He is still laughing.

210
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Thank you.

211
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I'm from Yugawara.

212
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,000
You can see me from the left or from the back.

213
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
He is still laughing.

214
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I want to introduce something delicious before I go to bed.

215
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
What is it?

216
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Where is Mr. Okami?

217
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Mr. Okami?

218
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
He is a good man.

219
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
What is it?

220
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
This is Amanogawa Manju.

221
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Amanogawa?

222
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
It's a beautiful name.

223
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Did you draw Amanogawa?

224
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
We are filming.

225
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
We are filming.

226
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
This is Amanogawa.

227
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Why do you call it Amanogawa?

228
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I did my best.

229
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
It's beautiful.

230
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
It's beautiful.

231
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
It's beautiful.

232
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
It's beautiful.

233
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
It's beautiful.

234
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
It's beautiful.

235
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
It's beautiful.

236
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Don't say unnecessary things.

237
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Don't say unnecessary things.

238
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
That's why he laughed.

239
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
It hurts.

240
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Is it delicious?

241
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
It's delicious.

242
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
There are many other delicious foods.

243
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Please look forward to it.

244
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Yes.

245
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
OK.

246
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:33,000
He is so small.

247
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
It's hot.

248
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
It hurts.

249
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
The director is so small.

250
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
He looks like an old man.

251
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Next.

252
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Let's go over there.

253
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Before we go to the inn,

254
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
let's go to the place we want to go.

255
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Let's go to the inn.

256
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Let's go.

257
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Hey.

258
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Is this the best place?

259
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Please get in the car.

260
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I'm going first.

261
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
You're going first.

262
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Please get in the car.

263
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Please get in the car.

264
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Excuse me.

265
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
It's more powerful than the last time.

266
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
That's right.

267
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
It's amazing.

268
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
The promotion of DYNAMITE was amazing.

269
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
It was amazing.

270
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I don't think so.

271
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
You guys are so small.

272
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Are you doing a business service?

273
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Where are they going?

274
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
What is waiting for them?

275
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
It's amazing.

276
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
There are so many things.

277
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
That sign is amazing.

278
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
It's amazing, isn't it?

279
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
It's amazing.

280
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
It's amazing.

281
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Can I listen to the radio?

282
00:15:39,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Yes.

283
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:12,000
The show will begin soon.

284
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I was really surprised.

285
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
This year is the year of the monkey.

286
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
It's the year of the monkey meat.

287
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
That's why I was surprised.

288
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
When I think about it,

289
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
It feels like it's the year of the monkey.

290
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
It's the year of the monkey.

291
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Please give me more time.

292
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
And

293
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
You're out.

294
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I can't stop it here.

295
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I want you to come to Yukawara.

296
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I'm so tired.

297
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I don't have time to rest.

298
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I'm so hungry.

299
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Ouch!

300
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:04,000
What kind of sound is this?

301
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I heard a loud noise.

302
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I'm so tired.

303
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
It's tough.

304
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Can I listen to the radio?

305
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I don't know what to do with this.

306
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Why?

307
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Yukawara on my mind.

308
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Dynamite Shikoku is coming to Yukawara.

309
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I'm so sorry.

310
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I'm so sorry.

311
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I'm so sorry.

312
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Dynamite Shikoku is coming to Yukawara.

313
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I'm so sorry.

314
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Let's go to Yukawara.

315
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I was surprised.

316
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Dynamite Shikoku is weak.

317
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I'm getting tired.

318
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Good luck, Tanaka.

319
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Can I listen to the radio?

320
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Yes, you can.

321
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I can't listen to the radio.

322
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Why don't you listen to the radio?

323
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I'm so sorry.

324
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I'm so sorry.

325
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I'm so sorry.

326
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I'm so sorry.

327
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Ouch!

328
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I'm so sorry.

329
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I'm so sorry.

330
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Ouch!

331
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I'm so sorry.

332
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:51,000
He is waiting for a chance to attack.

333
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I'm so sorry.

334
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I'm so sorry.

335
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I'm so sorry.

336
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
I'm so sorry.

337
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I'm so sorry.

338
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I'm so sorry.

339
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I'm so sorry.

340
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Why did you go to LA in Yukawara?

341
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I'm so sorry.

342
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I'm so sorry.

343
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
He is coming.

344
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Ouch!

345
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Ouch!

346
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
He is still going to LA.

347
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Ouch!

348
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
He is still going to LA.

349
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
He is still going to LA.

350
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Ouch!

351
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
He is going to laugh.

352
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
He is going to laugh.

353
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
He is coming.

354
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I have a cramp.

355
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I think I have a cramp.

356
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I haven't arrived at the inn yet.

357
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
I haven't arrived at the inn yet.

358
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Is this dirty?

359
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
It's dirty.

360
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
I'm wearing glasses.

361
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:27,000
He is laughing.

362
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Stop it!

363
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Stop it!

364
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Stop it!

365
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Why are you sleeping?

366
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Why are you sleeping?

367
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Why are you sleeping?

368
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Why?

369
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Why?

370
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Why?

371
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
I see.

372
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
It hurts.

373
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
It hurts.

374
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
That's amazing.

375
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Ouch!

376
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Ouch!

377
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Ouch!

378
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
It hurts a lot.

379
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
It hurts a lot.

380
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
It hurts a lot.

381
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
It's funny.

382
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
I don't want to go to the inn at all.

383
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
I know.

384
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
I can't wait.

385
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
I can't wait.

386
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
I'm sorry.

387
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Don't apologize.

388
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Ikko finally arrives at his next destination.

389
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,000
However, where has he arrived?

390
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Can you get off?

391
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Let's go to the inn.

392
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Let's go to the inn.

393
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Let's go to the inn.

394
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Let's go to the inn.

395
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
This is a temple.

396
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
You have a lot of desires.

397
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I want you to practice here.

398
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
I see.

399
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Follow me.

400
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Is this a temple?

401
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,000
This is an old and righteous temple.

402
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:10,000
What kind of training will the three of them receive here?

403
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Let's not talk about unnecessary things.

404
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
That's right.

405
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Tanako is really going down.

406
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
It's strange.

407
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
I'm fighting.

408
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
It doesn't matter.

409
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
What do you hate?

410
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
What do you hate?

411
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
What do you think I am?

412
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
I'm not good at using the steering wheel.

413
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
I've changed.

414
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
I'm using it properly.

415
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
I'm telling you because I'm not tired.

416
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
I'm not tired at all.

417
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
You're usually tired.

418
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Then why did you invite me to Hokkaido?

419
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I can't help it because you were the only one there.

420
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
What is it?

421
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
What is it?

422
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
What is it?

423
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
What is it?

424
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Yamasaki out.

425
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
You were born.

426
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
What is it?

427
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Wait a minute.

428
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Tanaka out.

429
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Yamasaki out.

430
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
It hurts.

431
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
I'm sorry.

432
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
What is it?

433
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Why are you laughing?

434
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
What is it?

435
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
I don't know.

436
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
It hurts.

437
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
What is it?

438
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
You hit your hip.

439
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
That's it.

440
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Please say hello to the staff who will be taking care of you from now on.

441
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Staff.

442
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Yes.

443
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Welcome to the staff's exhibition.

444
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Please come in.

445
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
I'll show you around.

446
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
This way, please.

447
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Thank you in advance.

448
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Of course.

449
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Can I come in?

450
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Please come in.

451
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
This is the main hall.

452
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Behind me is the head office of the history department.

453
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:10,000
The first right corner is the head office of the history department.

454
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,000
The first right corner is the head office of the history department.

455
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,000
The first right corner is the head office of the history department.

456
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
The head office of the history department.

457
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
I'm from Kyoto.

458
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
I'm from Kyoto.

459
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
I'd like to meet you all.

460
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:34,000
I'm not rude.

461
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Please come in.

462
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
It was hot, wasn't it?

463
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
I'm sorry.

464
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:07,000
It's okay.

465
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
That's what summer is all about.

466
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:25,000
It was really hot this year, wasn't it?

467
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Is that so?

468
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
It's hot.

469
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
It's hot.

470
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:39,000
How is it?

471
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:44,000
It's hot, isn't it?

472
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
It's still hot.

473
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
It's amazing.

474
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:56,000
There are times like this on this show.

475
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
That's right.

476
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:01,000
It was hot, wasn't it?

477
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
I am.

478
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
It's sudden, but.

479
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Well then.

480
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:15,000
I am.

481
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:20,000
First.

482
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:37,000
I am.

483
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
It hurts.

484
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,000
It's starting to hurt.

485
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
It hurts.

486
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:48,000
It hurts.

487
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Well then.

488
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:55,000
I'd like you all to do zazen.

489
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:06,000
It's okay to keep your eyes open, but please don't disturb your mind.

490
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Well then, let's start zazen.

491
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Well then, let's start zazen.

492
00:28:53,000 --> 00:29:04,000
I'm pregnant.

493
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:12,000
I'm pregnant.

494
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:25,000
You don't have enough training.

495
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Hello.

496
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Hello.

497
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Hello.

498
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Hello.

499
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Hello.

500
00:29:54,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Hello.

501
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Hello.

502
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Hello.

503
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,000
It hurts.

504
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,000
You don't have enough training.

505
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:45,000
What the hell is that guy?

506
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:51,000
I don't like this.

507
00:30:51,000 --> 00:31:00,000
It hurts a little.

508
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Tanaka out.

509
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,000
You don't have enough training.

510
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:17,000
It hurts.

511
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:28,000
That's amazing.

512
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Oh, Maito.

513
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Don't call me Maito.

514
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
It's Dynamite Shokoku.

515
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:37,000
You're the only one who calls me Maito.

516
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Can I talk to you for a second?

517
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
I was beaten.

518
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Excuse me.

519
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,000
The strongest wrestler in the world.

520
00:31:54,000 --> 00:32:04,000
I hope to beat Escargoman.

521
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Tanaka out.

522
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Don't call me Dynamite Shokoku.

523
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
It hurts.

524
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Let's go.

525
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Here?

526
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
One.

527
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Two.

528
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Three.

529
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Four.

530
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Tanaka out.

531
00:32:43,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Stop it.

532
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:10,000
You need more training.

533
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Thank you very much.

534
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
This is the end of the training.

535
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:19,000
You learned English, didn't you?

536
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:26,000
They haven't even arrived at the inn for three hours since the start, but they're already about to give up.

537
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:32,000
But after this, the penalty game will continue.

538
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Are you still at the inn?

539
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
I'm still at the inn.

540
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
That's right.

541
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
It's true.

542
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:41,000
You two haven't met yet.

543
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Tanaka is the funniest one so far.

544
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Tanaka is so loose.

545
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:52,000
I went to the inn before, but that was the first time I met him.

546
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:58,000
I was wondering if I would meet him like this.

547
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,000
But Dynamite Shokoku is interesting.

548
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Actually, it's been seven years since he came back.

549
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:09,000
He came out for the first time during the 7th Henge.

550
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
During the 7th Henge?

551
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
That's right.

552
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,000
It was seven or eight years ago.

553
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
That's right.

554
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
It was the first time.

555
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
That's right.

556
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Since the first time I met him, I've been a pot.

557
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
It's been seven years.

558
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
It's been more than seven years.

559
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
He came out.

560
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
I see.

561
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Everyone has a pot.

562
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:34,000
I actually saw him at the end of the 14th.

563
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,000
He has a great impact.

564
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
He is tough.

565
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,000
You haven't seen him in person, right?

566
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,000
He's really a four-headed man.

567
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,000
He's a two-headed man.

568
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
He's a one-headed man.

569
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
A one-headed man?

570
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
He's a one-headed man.

571
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
He's not a one-headed man.

572
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
It's just his face.

573
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
It's just his face.

574
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
It's just his face.

575
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
He doesn't have any organs.

576
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:06,000
It's 6pm. The sun has set and the three of us are finally in the hotel.

577
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:20,000
This is the hotel where the three of us will be staying tonight. What kind of trick is waiting for us?

578
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:26,000
This is the hotel where the three of us will be staying tonight. What kind of trick is waiting for us?

579
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Good morning.

580
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
I bought it.

581
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
I bought it.

582
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
I bought it.

583
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
I bought it.

584
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:45,000
This is a nice team.

585
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
This is so bad.

586
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
I can't do it.

587
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
You have to do it.

588
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
I can't do it.

589
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,000
I can't do it.

590
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
I can't do it.

591
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
I can't do it.

592
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
I can't do it.

593
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
It hurts.

594
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Let's go to the room.

595
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
This is a good place.

596
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
This is a good place.

597
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
This is a good room.

598
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
This is a good room.

599
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
I haven't seen the room yet.

600
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Do you remember the room in the script?

601
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
This is a good room.

602
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
This is a good room.

603
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
I'm going to the room.

604
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
I'm going to the room.

605
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
I'm going to the room.

606
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
I'm going to the room.

607
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:10,000
I'm going to the room.

608
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
I'm going to the room.

609
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
I'm going to the room.

610
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
I'm going to the room.

611
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
There is something here.

612
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Hamada out.

613
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Hamada out.

614
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
No, I'm Yamada.

615
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Hamada out.

616
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Stop it.

617
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Why?

618
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Hamada out.

619
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
What?

620
00:37:52,000 --> 00:38:00,000
I don't do anything even if I laugh.

621
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Did you laugh in the bathroom?

622
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
I laughed.

623
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
I feel like I only did Hokusai Enda.

624
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
I was also hit.

625
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Hamada out.

626
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
He came out.

627
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Hamada out.

628
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
This is you.

629
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
I was surprised.

630
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Why did you get hit?

631
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
I don't know.

632
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Hamada out.

633
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
I was hit.

634
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Stop it.

635
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Stop it.

636
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Stop it.

637
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
I was hit.

638
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
It was painful.

639
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
It was really painful.

640
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
There was a bat in the middle.

641
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Yes.

642
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
This is also painful.

643
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
This is also painful.

644
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
This is the pamphlet Yamazaki got.

645
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:20,000
This program is introduced with the characters that came to Yumamara.

646
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
This is painful.

647
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Yamazaki.

648
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Hamada out.

649
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Hamada out.

650
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Stop it.

651
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Stop it.

652
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
I was hit.

653
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
I was hit.

654
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:50,000
I don't think I should laugh when someone hits me.

655
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
This is really painful.

656
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
This is painful.

657
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
This is beautiful.

658
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
There are many.

659
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
This is also beautiful.

660
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
I want to enter the showroom.

661
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:08,000
This is good.

662
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Hamada out.

663
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Hamada out.

664
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
I was hit.

665
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
I was surprised.

666
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
This is painful.

667
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
This is painful.

668
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
This is not funny.

669
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
I was surprised.

670
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
I can't find it.

671
00:40:54,000 --> 00:41:00,000
There is a yukata here.

672
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Yes.

673
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:06,000
The size is L and M.

674
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Which one is good for Tanaka?

675
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
I want L.

676
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
I understand.

677
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Yamazaki.

678
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,000
I want M.

679
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
I understand.

680
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
What about Kuchibirobake?

681
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
I want Kuchibirobake.

682
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
This is painful.

683
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
This is painful.

684
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
I forgot something important.

685
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
This is a video of the showroom.

686
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
This is a video of the showroom.

687
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Please see this.

688
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Yes.

689
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
Excuse me.

690
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
This is really embarrassing.

691
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
This is the first time I've seen this.

692
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
This is embarrassing.

693
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000
I didn't see it.

694
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
This is really embarrassing.

695
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
This is embarrassing.

696
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Please end this.

697
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
I'm going.

698
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
I'm going.

699
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Yamazaki.

700
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Damn it.

701
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
This is painful.

702
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
He was coming.

703
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Today, I will guide you.

704
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
This is a long video.

705
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
This is a long video.

706
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
I took a lot of videos.

707
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
This is a long video.

708
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
I will do this.

709
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
I will do this.

710
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,000
I will do this.

711
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
This is cheap.

712
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
This is cheap.

713
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:30,000
I want to go to the beach.

714
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
I want to go to the beach.

715
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
I want to go to the beach.

716
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
I want to go to the beach.

717
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
I did my best.

718
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
I went to the beach.

719
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
Good morning.

720
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Meanwhile, Matsumoto arrived at the inn.

721
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
This is amazing.

722
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
This is amazing.

723
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,000
This is amazing.

724
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
This is amazing.

725
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
It's 7 o'clock in the afternoon.

726
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Only 5 hours have passed since the start.

727
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:22,000
The three people who entered the room are in relaxed mode in their yukata.

728
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:32,000
The three people who entered the room are in relaxed mode in their yukata.

729
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
This is Chachin.

730
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
This is a battle.

731
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
This is a battle.

732
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
They are in a great mood.

733
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,000
They are in a great mood.

734
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
I'm looking forward to it.

735
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
The store is crowded.

736
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
The store is crowded.

737
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
There are so many people here.

738
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
There are so many people here.

739
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
1

740
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
2

741
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
3

742
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
4

743
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
5

744
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
6

745
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
7

746
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
8

747
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
9

748
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
10

749
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
11

750
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
12

751
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
13

752
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
14

753
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:47,000
In the atmosphere of praise

754
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,000
Yanasaki, out of the bag

755
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,000
You're ouiht!!

756
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:14,000
It's different from when he was wearing jeans, right?

757
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Hana-chan is laughing too!

758
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,000
He's laughing

759
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,000
He's laughing

760
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,000
He's laughing

761
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,000
It's funny

762
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:41,000
It's funny

763
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:44,000
What time is it now?

764
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:48,000
It's probably around 7 o'clock

765
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,000
It's past 7

766
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,000
I don't know the time

767
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,000
I really don't know

768
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
This is hard

769
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
What is it?

770
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:59,000
I'm hungry

771
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
I've been eating a lot recently

772
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,000
Really?

773
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,000
I quit smoking

774
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
I see

775
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Who?

776
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,000
I quit

777
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,000
I see

778
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,000
I eat a lot

779
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:14,000
How long has it been since you quit?

780
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:17,000
2 and a half months

781
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
2 and a half months

782
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:23,000
I want to quit smoking

783
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:26,000
I don't think I should quit

784
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,000
That's right

785
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
It's good to smoke when you have it

786
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
It's getting stronger

787
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,000
What's getting stronger?

788
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
The amount of smoke

789
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
The amount of smoke?

790
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
Yamasaki, out

791
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
What do you mean by the amount of smoke?

792
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,000
Out

793
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
No way

794
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:54,000
What?

795
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Ouch

796
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Ouch

797
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,000
You shouldn't smoke

798
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,000
Did you do it on purpose?

799
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
No

800
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,000
If you did it on purpose, you shouldn't smoke

801
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:12,000
I don't know

802
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,000
What?

803
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
The gorilla is weird

804
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:18,000
The gorilla is weird

805
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:21,000
The gorilla is weird

806
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
The gorilla is weird

807
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:26,000
I'm going to die

808
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:29,000
Stop it

809
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
Tanaka

810
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
Stop it

811
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:37,000
You don't have to talk

812
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:41,000
Ouch

813
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:45,000
I did it

814
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:49,000
You always try to talk

815
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,000
No

816
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:55,000
If you did it on purpose, you shouldn't smoke

817
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:58,000
I wanted to explain

818
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
You shouldn't smoke

819
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
You shouldn't smoke

820
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:06,000
It's weird

821
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:18,000
You shouldn't smoke

822
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,000
What are you doing?

823
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:24,000
It's not that time yet

824
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Out

825
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,000
Yamada

826
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,000
Yamasaki

827
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:32,000
What?

828
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Why are you doing this?

829
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:38,000
I thought you were going to be okay

830
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,000
Stop it

831
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:44,000
Why are you talking in a gentle voice?

832
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
Stop it

833
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,000
Ouch

834
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
What is he doing?

835
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
He's wearing a uniform

836
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:57,000
He's amazing

837
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:05,000
It's not that time yet

838
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:40,000
Ouch

839
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Yamada

840
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,000
Yamasaki

841
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:48,000
What are you doing?

842
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
Ouch

843
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:55,000
Ouch

844
00:50:55,000 --> 00:51:00,000
What are you doing?

845
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:04,000
I don't like it

846
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:20,000
I thought you were going to be okay

847
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:28,000
I thought you were going to be okay

848
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:34,000
Stop it

849
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:37,000
Out

850
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,000
Yamada

851
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,000
Yamasaki

852
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
Stop it

853
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
Stop it

854
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:50,000
Ouch

855
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:54,000
It's cold

856
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:57,000
It's cold

857
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:02,000
This is

858
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:20,000
Stop it

859
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,000
Yamada

860
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
Out

861
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:27,000
Stop it

862
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:33,000
He's wearing a uniform

863
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
He's wearing a uniform

864
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:45,000
Ouch

865
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
It's 9pm

866
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:53,000
7 hours have passed since the punishment game started

867
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:57,000
It's time for you to go to bed

868
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:01,000
Let's go to the hot spring

869
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
You want to go to the hot spring, don't you?

870
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,000
Yes

871
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
Let's go

872
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,000
Shall we go?

873
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:11,000
Yes

874
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:15,000
This hot spring is one of the few hot springs in Japan

875
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
Enjoy

876
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:38,000
Actually, what is Matsumoto doing in the shadow of the bath?

877
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,000
Yamada

878
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:42,000
Out

879
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:47,000
Ouch

880
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,000
I did it

881
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:52,000
Ouch

882
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:55,000
I'm tired

883
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
I'm tired

884
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
I'm tired

885
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:08,000
I'm tired

886
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:25,000
I'm tired

887
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:44,000
I'm tired

888
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,000
Yamada

889
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,000
Yamasaki

890
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
Out

891
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,000
Yamada

892
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
Out

893
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:56,000
Wait

894
00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:02,000
Ouch

895
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:06,000
Ouch

896
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:09,000
Wait a minute

897
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
What are you doing?

898
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
What are you doing on TV?

899
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:16,000
You can't be naked in the hot spring

900
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:19,000
I've prepared a hot spring

901
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:34,000
Hey, Tanaka

902
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,000
Yamasaki

903
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
Out

904
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
Who is it?

905
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:42,000
Please be kind to me

906
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
Please

907
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:47,000
Ouch

908
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:51,000
It hurts so much

909
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
Tanaka

910
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:57,000
Put this on

911
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,000
Next

912
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
Yamasaki

913
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:08,000
Yamasaki

914
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,000
Yamasaki

915
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:12,000
Is this ready?

916
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:16,000
I don't want to put this on

917
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:29,000
Next, Yamada

918
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:30,000
Yamada

919
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:36,000
Out

920
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:41,000
Ouch

921
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:46,000
Ouch

922
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,000
Yamada

923
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,000
Out

924
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,000
Tanaka

925
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,000
Out

926
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:53,000
Why are you doing this?

927
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:56,000
Why are you doing this?

928
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:00,000
Why are you doing this?

929
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:08,000
Ouch

930
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:14,000
It hurts so much

931
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:19,000
Ouch

932
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:23,000
Why are you doing this?

933
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
Why are you doing this?

934
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:30,000
Why are you doing this?

935
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:46,000
Ouch

936
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:55,000
Ouch

937
00:57:55,000 --> 00:58:00,000
Out

938
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,000
Next

939
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:02,000
Yamada

940
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:03,000
Yamada

941
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:06,000
Out

942
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:10,000
Why are you doing this?

943
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:13,000
Why are you doing this?

944
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:20,000
Ouch

945
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:26,000
Hey, Fujiwara

946
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
Out

947
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:32,000
Hey

948
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:53,000
The ball flew

949
00:58:53,000 --> 00:59:08,000
What is this?

950
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:11,000
Why?

951
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
Why?

952
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
Yamasaki

953
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:16,000
Why?

954
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:22,000
Why are you doing this?

955
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:41,000
Ouch

956
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:46,000
Tanaka has a great camera

957
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:51,000
I can't catch it at all

958
00:59:51,000 --> 01:00:16,000
This is the story of a military critic

959
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:41,000
I can't catch it

960
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:49,000
It was big when I took it out of the basket

961
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:52,000
That's

962
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:55,000
It's so hot

963
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:56,000
What is this?

964
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:00,000
I'm so jealous

965
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:23,000
It's so hot

966
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:39,000
What is this?

967
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:40,000
Tanaka

968
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
Out

969
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
Please cut my eyes

970
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:48,000
Out

971
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:51,000
Ouch

972
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,000
I don't like it

973
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:57,000
It's hot

974
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:01,000
You've been looking at me all the time, haven't you?

975
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
You've been looking at me, haven't you?

976
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:07,000
You've been looking at me, haven't you?

977
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
It's so hot

978
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:12,000
I know

979
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:13,000
Hamada, you're so persistent

980
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:17,000
How long are you going to be like this?

981
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:31,000
Die

982
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:32,000
Yamaguchi, why don't you try it on?

983
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:39,000
Die

984
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:50,000
At 10 o'clock in the afternoon, a familiar figure comes to the three people in the room

985
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:53,000
Yes

986
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:56,000
Thank you for your hard work

987
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
Thank you for your hard work

988
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:10,000
There's a wedding coming up soon, so it's kind of like a follow-up. Is everyone okay?

989
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:13,000
It looks like you're tired

990
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:21,000
Is everyone okay?

991
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
Fukada

992
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:24,000
Fukada

993
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:25,000
What?

994
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:28,000
Let me hear the speech again

995
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:31,000
The speech is supposed to be done at the ceremony

996
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:35,000
Fukada, let me hear the speech again

997
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:36,000
I'll do it at the ceremony

998
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
Let me hear it again

999
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
I'll go home when I hear it

1000
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
Are you done?

1001
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:48,000
There are three important bags for a couple to be happy

1002
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:54,000
The first one is an egg bag

1003
01:03:54,000 --> 01:04:01,000
I got an egg

1004
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:06,000
Fukada, let me hear it again

1005
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:12,000
I'm sorry

1006
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:17,000
That's enough

1007
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:22,000
Fukada, let me hear it

1008
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:27,000
Fukada, let me hear it again

1009
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:30,000
I'll go home when I hear it

1010
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:35,000
It doesn't matter if it's an ogiwara or a hagiwara

1011
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:39,000
Ogifara and hagiwara

1012
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:40,000
Are you done?

1013
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:43,000
Ogifara and hagiwara

1014
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:49,000
Fukada, let me hear it again

1015
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:53,000
I'll go home when I hear it

1016
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:57,000
I'll go home when I hear it

1017
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:00,000
That's enough

1018
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,000
Kanaka

1019
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:04,000
Yamasaki

1020
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:07,000
No

1021
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:10,000
Ouch

1022
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:13,000
Ouch

1023
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:21,000
Once again, Matsumoto makes a plan to bring Hamada and the others down

1024
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:30,000
Matsumoto

1025
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
How is it?

1026
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:35,000
How is it?

1027
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:49,000
You're doing pretty well in the punishment game

1028
01:05:49,000 --> 01:06:01,000
Do you want some water?

1029
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:05,000
Yamasaki, out

1030
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:10,000
What is that?

1031
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:13,000
What is it?

1032
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
Ouch

1033
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:18,000
It's a human-beast

1034
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:21,000
I don't know why you look so disgusted

1035
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:24,000
I'll split you up

1036
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:30,000
You're here to encourage me

1037
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:33,000
Talk

1038
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:45,000
I'm just talking

1039
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:50,000
Why did you bring this?

1040
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
What is it?

1041
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:59,000
I want you to see it

1042
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:03,000
Yamasaki

1043
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:04,000
Yamasaki

1044
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:05,000
Kanaka

1045
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:06,000
Out

1046
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:12,000
It's a goal

1047
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
It's a goal

1048
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:18,000
It's a goal

1049
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:23,000
Ouch

1050
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,000
I'm sorry

1051
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:28,000
I wanted to show you

1052
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:36,000
Do you like this kind of game?

1053
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
It's a goal

1054
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:42,000
That was close

1055
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:45,000
It's fun

1056
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:48,000
It's a goal

1057
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:49,000
It's a goal

1058
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:52,000
It's a goal

1059
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:55,000
It's normal

1060
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:58,000
Why is it all gold?

1061
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:03,000
I'm counting on you

1062
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
It hurts

1063
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:08,000
It hurts

1064
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:12,000
I want to stop when I'm done

1065
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:16,000
I'm not going

1066
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
Good luck

1067
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:24,000
I haven't even folded it back yet

1068
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:30,000
What are you doing?

1069
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:31,000
Hamada

1070
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:32,000
Out

1071
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:36,000
What are you doing?

1072
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:46,000
I'm counting on you

1073
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
See you

1074
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:49,000
Thank you

1075
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:50,000
What?

1076
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:51,000
Thank you

1077
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:54,000
Hamada

1078
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:55,000
Out

1079
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:59,000
What are you doing?

1080
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:02,000
It hurts

1081
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:16,000
I'm going in

1082
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:22,000
It hurts

1083
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:52,000
Hey

1084
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:57,000
Hey

1085
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:02,000
Hey

1086
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:05,000
Hey

1087
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:09,000
Hey

1088
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:13,000
Hey

1089
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:16,000
Hey

1090
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:23,000
Hey

1091
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:48,000
Hey

1092
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:53,000
Are you okay?

1093
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:58,000
What is this?

1094
01:10:58,000 --> 01:10:59,000
Hamada

1095
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:04,000
Out

1096
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:07,000
Stop it

1097
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:15,000
It hurts

1098
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:18,000
It's 11 p.m.

1099
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:21,000
The three of them haven't eaten anything since they arrived in Yugawara

1100
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:24,000
They're hungry or full

1101
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
It stinks

1102
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:37,000
You guys stink

1103
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:41,000
You guys keep saying you're hungry

1104
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:46,000
I prepared food

1105
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:47,000
Do you want to eat?

1106
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:48,000
I don't want to eat

1107
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:52,000
It can't be helped

1108
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:55,000
Let's eat

1109
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
Let's get back into it

1110
01:11:57,000 --> 01:12:09,000
Let's do that

1111
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:12,000
You don't know what it is, do you?

1112
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
I don't know either

1113
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:15,000
It's different

1114
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:26,000
What?

1115
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:27,000
Yamasaki

1116
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:28,000
Hamada

1117
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:29,000
Out

1118
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:33,000
Stop it

1119
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:37,000
It hurts

1120
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:46,000
It hurts

1121
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
What is this?

1122
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:49,000
It's a snack

1123
01:12:49,000 --> 01:13:03,000
I'm going to eat it

1124
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:04,000
Tanaka

1125
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
Out

1126
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:14,000
It hurts

1127
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:20,000
It hurts

1128
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:25,000
What are you doing?

1129
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:31,000
What are you doing?

1130
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:39,000
I don't want to eat

1131
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:45,000
You don't have to laugh

1132
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:55,000
What is this?

1133
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:58,000
What is that?

1134
01:13:58,000 --> 01:13:59,000
It's underwear

1135
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:04,000
I ate a lot

1136
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:07,000
I'm in a bad mood

1137
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:10,000
I ate a lot

1138
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:13,000
Excuse me

1139
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:22,000
Actually, we have a Japan tour in the room next door

1140
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:32,000
I'm going to make a little noise

1141
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:59,000
I ate a lot

1142
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:09,000
I ate a lot

1143
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:19,000
I ate a lot

1144
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:44,000
I ate a lot

1145
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:57,000
I ate a lot

1146
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
Thank you very much

1147
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:08,000
Please come back with the best drink

1148
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:27,000
I'm tired

1149
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:28,000
Yamasaki

1150
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:32,000
Out

1151
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:38,000
What are you doing?

1152
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:41,000
I ate a lot

1153
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:46,000
It hurts

1154
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:50,000
10 hours from the start of the punishment game

1155
01:16:50,000 --> 01:17:06,000
After a series of attacks, the three of them started to look tired

1156
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:09,000
What are you going to do with Mr. Malik?

1157
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:14,000
Talk

1158
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:20,000
Do you have a name?

1159
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
Was it a Japanese name?

1160
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:25,000
Was it Matsuo Shoukyokusai?

1161
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:38,000
Matsuo

1162
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:45,000
Where did you bring it from?

1163
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:46,000
Tanaka

1164
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:47,000
Out

1165
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:51,000
Do you have another name?

1166
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:54,000
What kind of name is Matsuo Shoukyokusai?

1167
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:59,000
It's a very important person

1168
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,000
It hurts

1169
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:06,000
But that's because you say you don't know Matsuo Shoukyokusai

1170
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
Do you know Matsuo Shoukyokusai?

1171
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
I don't know

1172
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
Was it when you were dressed up as an old man?

1173
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:13,000
That's right

1174
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:16,000
I wonder if you were doing something

1175
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:22,000
Let's go to the next design parma

1176
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
What is a design parma?

1177
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:27,000
This is my

1178
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:28,000
Why

1179
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:48,000
I only draw the top

1180
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
I think you can do it

1181
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:53,000
But it's a part parma, probably a design parma

1182
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:56,000
It's not

1183
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:59,000
Who is a design parma?

1184
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,000
I don't know

1185
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,000
Probably

1186
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:10,000
Probably?

1187
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:11,000
Tanaka

1188
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:12,000
Out

1189
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
I don't know Tanaka

1190
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:15,000
I don't know

1191
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,000
I don't know

1192
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:21,000
I know that, but probably?

1193
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:25,000
It hurts

1194
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:38,000
It hurts

1195
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:41,000
Actually today

1196
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:46,000
Hollywood stars are staying here

1197
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:49,000
I want to say hello to something like you

1198
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,000
I'll be surprised

1199
01:19:51,000 --> 01:20:06,000
Please

1200
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:18,000
You look like you're crying

1201
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:21,000
Yamasaki

1202
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:22,000
Out

1203
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:30,000
I've seen it many times

1204
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:31,000
Mr. Deniro

1205
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:32,000
Mr. Deniro

1206
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:45,000
Good evening

1207
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:54,000
Mr. Deniro

1208
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:55,000
Tanaka

1209
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:56,000
Tanaka

1210
01:20:56,000 --> 01:21:07,000
Out

1211
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:13,000
It hurts

1212
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,000
how much money do you have?

1213
01:21:18,560 --> 01:21:21,220
I have 90 million

1214
01:21:27,200 --> 01:21:28,200
why!?

1215
01:21:29,860 --> 01:21:31,860
this is gross, please

1216
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
man, you really are crazy

1217
01:21:36,640 --> 01:21:37,380
OUCH

1218
01:21:38,380 --> 01:21:39,380
why

1219
01:21:39,360 --> 01:21:41,320
I didn't mean to help you

1220
01:21:41,320 --> 01:21:42,320
Ah, wait!

1221
01:21:42,320 --> 01:21:44,320
Ah, that hurts!

1222
01:21:44,320 --> 01:21:46,320
Why are you pretending to sleep?

1223
01:21:47,320 --> 01:21:49,320
I'll never laugh!

1224
01:21:49,320 --> 01:22:15,320
This is Deniro throwing a hammer.

1225
01:22:15,320 --> 01:22:19,320
Deniro-san is busy too, so I'll give him a hammer.

1226
01:22:19,320 --> 01:22:42,320
I'm glad.

1227
01:22:42,320 --> 01:22:45,320
Ouch, that hurt.

1228
01:22:45,320 --> 01:22:46,320
You know what?

1229
01:22:46,320 --> 01:22:47,320
Yes?

1230
01:22:47,320 --> 01:22:48,320
I'm really sorry.

1231
01:22:48,320 --> 01:22:50,320
It was C-3PO, right?

1232
01:22:50,320 --> 01:22:51,320
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

1233
01:22:51,320 --> 01:22:53,320
It's different from the hammer.

1234
01:22:53,320 --> 01:22:55,320
It comes out like this, right?

1235
01:22:55,320 --> 01:22:59,320
I wanted to open it and take out the in-ring.

1236
01:22:59,320 --> 01:23:02,320
The in-ring is like this, so I can't open it.

1237
01:23:02,320 --> 01:23:06,320
Nakamura went and tried to open it and put in the in-ring.

1238
01:23:06,320 --> 01:23:09,320
Just opening it makes me laugh.

1239
01:23:09,320 --> 01:23:11,320
Ah, is that so?

1240
01:23:11,320 --> 01:23:14,320
I wanted to open it and take out the in-ring.

1241
01:23:14,320 --> 01:23:16,320
But the in-ring is like this again.

1242
01:23:16,320 --> 01:23:17,320
I'll close it.

1243
01:23:17,320 --> 01:23:19,320
I'll close it again!

1244
01:23:19,320 --> 01:23:22,320
I'll take out the in-ring again!

1245
01:23:22,320 --> 01:23:23,320
Ah, is that so?

1246
01:23:23,320 --> 01:23:25,320
But the in-ring is like this again.

1247
01:23:25,320 --> 01:23:27,320
Ah, it hurts.

1248
01:23:27,320 --> 01:23:28,320
But the in-ring is like this again.

1249
01:23:28,320 --> 01:23:31,320
I'm sorry!

1250
01:23:31,320 --> 01:23:34,320
Go home!

1251
01:23:34,320 --> 01:23:41,320
One o'clock in the morning. 11 hours have passed since the start, and the three of them look pretty tired.

1252
01:23:41,320 --> 01:23:43,320
But don't worry about that.

1253
01:23:43,320 --> 01:24:08,320
With or without the hammer, they'll get a new license.

1254
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:36,320
They'll get a new license.

1255
01:24:36,320 --> 01:24:38,320
He's really fast.

1256
01:24:38,320 --> 01:24:42,320
He's not a professional at all.

1257
01:24:42,320 --> 01:24:51,320
He's been doing it many times.

1258
01:24:51,320 --> 01:25:05,320
He's like a dog.

1259
01:25:05,320 --> 01:25:08,320
Hello?

1260
01:25:08,320 --> 01:25:10,320
Yeah.

1261
01:25:10,320 --> 01:25:18,320
Black glasses.

1262
01:25:18,320 --> 01:25:21,320
Yeah, I'm not going to say that right now.

1263
01:25:21,320 --> 01:25:25,320
What are you saying?

1264
01:25:25,320 --> 01:25:28,320
Yes.

1265
01:25:28,320 --> 01:25:32,320
Change.

1266
01:25:32,320 --> 01:25:59,320
I'm a contact lens guy.

1267
01:25:59,320 --> 01:26:08,320
Wait a minute.

1268
01:26:08,320 --> 01:26:13,320
Wait a minute.

1269
01:26:13,320 --> 01:26:17,320
You're going to be surprised.

1270
01:26:17,320 --> 01:26:24,320
I'm more surprised than laughing.

1271
01:26:24,320 --> 01:26:30,320
It hurts.

1272
01:26:30,320 --> 01:26:33,320
I've been to Paris about three times.

1273
01:26:33,320 --> 01:26:34,320
Really?

1274
01:26:34,320 --> 01:26:35,320
Yes.

1275
01:26:35,320 --> 01:26:36,320
You've been there that many times?

1276
01:26:36,320 --> 01:26:37,320
I've been there.

1277
01:26:37,320 --> 01:26:46,320
I've never been there.

1278
01:26:46,320 --> 01:26:58,320
I've never been there.

1279
01:26:58,320 --> 01:27:01,320
He's doing his best.

1280
01:27:01,320 --> 01:27:07,320
I can't help but laugh.

1281
01:27:07,320 --> 01:27:10,320
He's laughing a lot.

1282
01:27:10,320 --> 01:27:15,320
He's laughing a lot.

1283
01:27:15,320 --> 01:27:20,320
Let's change the atmosphere here.

1284
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:26,320
Let's do it.

1285
01:27:26,320 --> 01:27:39,320
Let's proceed to the next stage.

1286
01:27:39,320 --> 01:27:41,320
Let's move on to the first question.

1287
01:27:41,320 --> 01:27:46,320
Do an impersonation of KUWATA KEISUKE.

1288
01:27:46,320 --> 01:28:01,320
End please.

1289
01:28:01,320 --> 01:28:03,320
Let's move on to Fujiwara.

1290
01:28:03,320 --> 01:28:18,320
Do an impersonation of KUWATA KEISUKE.

1291
01:28:18,320 --> 01:28:24,320
No knife.

1292
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:28,320
I can't help it.

1293
01:28:28,320 --> 01:28:30,320
Look, look at me.

1294
01:28:32,960 --> 01:28:34,960
That was safe, right?

1295
01:28:38,960 --> 01:28:40,960
That was strong, right?

1296
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:42,960
That was strong.

1297
01:28:42,960 --> 01:28:44,960
That was strange.

1298
01:28:44,960 --> 01:28:46,960
Go Hiromi's Mano Manchi

1299
01:28:46,960 --> 01:28:48,960
and what is it?

1300
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:54,480
Takoyaki.

1301
01:28:54,480 --> 01:28:56,480
What is it?

1302
01:28:56,480 --> 01:28:58,480
What is it?

1303
01:28:58,480 --> 01:29:00,480
I can't do it, I can't do it.

1304
01:29:00,480 --> 01:29:02,480
It's okay, it's okay.

1305
01:29:06,480 --> 01:29:08,480
Okonomiyaki.

1306
01:29:08,480 --> 01:29:10,480
That was good, right?

1307
01:29:10,480 --> 01:29:12,480
That was good, right?

1308
01:29:12,480 --> 01:29:14,480
That was cute.

1309
01:29:14,480 --> 01:29:16,480
That was good.

1310
01:29:16,480 --> 01:29:18,480
That was good.

1311
01:29:18,480 --> 01:29:24,480
Okonomiyaki.

1312
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:26,480
Yamazaki, what is it?

1313
01:29:26,480 --> 01:29:28,480
Okonomiyaki.

1314
01:29:28,480 --> 01:29:30,480
Okonomiyaki.

1315
01:29:34,480 --> 01:29:36,480
I've heard it so many times.

1316
01:29:36,480 --> 01:29:38,480
Okonomiyaki.

1317
01:29:38,480 --> 01:29:40,480
It hurts.

1318
01:29:40,480 --> 01:29:42,480
It hurts.

1319
01:29:42,480 --> 01:29:44,480
I came here to have fun.

1320
01:29:44,480 --> 01:29:46,480
I came here to have fun.

1321
01:29:46,480 --> 01:29:48,480
I had fun.

1322
01:29:50,480 --> 01:29:52,480
If you have any hope, I'll listen to you.

1323
01:29:54,480 --> 01:29:56,480
Take off your glasses and talk.

1324
01:30:00,480 --> 01:30:02,480
I'm getting angry.

1325
01:30:04,480 --> 01:30:06,480
So, Hamada.

1326
01:30:08,480 --> 01:30:10,480
If it's a person,

1327
01:30:10,480 --> 01:30:14,480
look at the person who's talking and talk.

1328
01:30:14,480 --> 01:30:16,480
Hamada.

1329
01:30:26,480 --> 01:30:28,480
I don't want to do it anymore.

1330
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:30,480
What?

1331
01:30:30,480 --> 01:30:32,480
I don't want to do it anymore.

1332
01:30:32,480 --> 01:30:34,480
I don't know what you're talking about.

1333
01:30:34,480 --> 01:30:36,480
I don't want to do it anymore.

1334
01:30:36,480 --> 01:30:38,480
Who are you taking with you?

1335
01:30:38,480 --> 01:30:40,480
Who are you taking with you?

1336
01:30:40,480 --> 01:30:42,480
Tell me clearly.

1337
01:30:42,480 --> 01:30:44,480
Look at the face.

1338
01:30:44,480 --> 01:30:46,480
Hamada.

1339
01:30:50,480 --> 01:30:52,480
Hamada.

1340
01:30:52,480 --> 01:30:54,480
I don't want to do it anymore.

1341
01:30:54,480 --> 01:30:56,480
I don't want to do it anymore.

1342
01:31:02,480 --> 01:31:04,480
Fujiwara.

1343
01:31:04,480 --> 01:31:06,480
Let's go home.

1344
01:31:06,480 --> 01:31:08,480
It's 2 a.m.

1345
01:31:08,480 --> 01:31:10,480
12 hours have passed since the start.

1346
01:31:12,480 --> 01:31:14,480
Here, three people go to the hall next to the inn.

1347
01:31:14,480 --> 01:31:16,480
Here, three people go to the hall next to the inn.

1348
01:31:16,480 --> 01:31:18,480
Here, three people go to the hall next to the inn.

1349
01:31:18,480 --> 01:31:20,480
Then.

1350
01:31:20,480 --> 01:31:22,480
I fell.

1351
01:31:22,480 --> 01:31:24,480
I fell.

1352
01:31:24,480 --> 01:31:26,480
I fell.

1353
01:31:34,480 --> 01:31:36,480
I'm scared.

1354
01:31:36,480 --> 01:31:38,480
I can't see anything.

1355
01:31:38,480 --> 01:31:40,480
I can't see anything.

1356
01:31:40,480 --> 01:31:42,480
I can't see anything.

1357
01:31:44,480 --> 01:31:46,480
Then they arrive at the temple.

1358
01:31:46,480 --> 01:31:48,480
Then they arrive at the temple.

1359
01:31:48,480 --> 01:31:50,480
Here, the priest will show us a horrible ghost photo.

1360
01:31:50,480 --> 01:31:52,480
Here, the priest will show us a horrible ghost photo.

1361
01:31:52,480 --> 01:31:54,480
Here we go.

1362
01:31:54,480 --> 01:31:56,480
First, look at this.

1363
01:31:56,480 --> 01:31:58,480
Boys are doing physical training.

1364
01:31:58,480 --> 01:32:00,480
Boys are doing physical training.

1365
01:32:00,480 --> 01:32:02,480
Among the five.

1366
01:32:02,480 --> 01:32:04,480
Among the five.

1367
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:06,480
It's unusual for two people to be together.

1368
01:32:06,480 --> 01:32:08,480
It's unusual for two people to be together.

1369
01:32:08,480 --> 01:32:10,480
The parents of the temple are joking.

1370
01:32:10,480 --> 01:32:12,480
The parents of the temple are joking.

1371
01:32:12,480 --> 01:32:14,480
But look closely.

1372
01:32:14,480 --> 01:32:16,480
But look closely.

1373
01:32:16,480 --> 01:32:18,480
The temple's reverse.

1374
01:32:18,480 --> 01:32:20,480
Each one.

1375
01:32:20,480 --> 01:32:22,480
Each one.

1376
01:32:22,480 --> 01:32:24,480
Each one.

1377
01:32:24,480 --> 01:32:26,480
Most of them are Kirishima.

1378
01:32:26,480 --> 01:32:28,480
Most of them are Kirishima.

1379
01:32:28,480 --> 01:32:30,480
This is no exception.

1380
01:32:30,480 --> 01:32:32,480
This is no exception.

1381
01:32:34,480 --> 01:32:26,480
In the stilted shrine,

1382
01:32:38,480 --> 01:32:40,480
There is no Kirishima.

1383
01:32:40,480 --> 01:32:42,480
There is no Kirishima.

1384
01:32:42,480 --> 01:32:44,480
This is a absolutely certain image.

1385
01:32:44,480 --> 01:32:46,480
This is a completely certain image.

1386
01:32:46,480 --> 01:32:48,480
In the future,

1387
01:32:48,480 --> 01:32:48,480
in the future,

1388
01:32:48,480 --> 01:32:48,480
in the future,

1389
01:32:48,480 --> 01:32:49,440
in the future,

1390
01:32:49,440 --> 01:32:49,940
be careful of Kirishima.

1391
01:32:49,940 --> 01:32:51,580
She's the danful ل tHis iod ochre

1392
01:32:51,580 --> 01:32:52,980
She's the danful ل tHis iod ochre

1393
01:33:10,520 --> 01:33:12,260
It's enmity again

1394
01:33:12,260 --> 01:33:15,260
He's still running.

1395
01:33:35,740 --> 01:33:36,500
That was terrible!

1396
01:33:36,500 --> 01:33:38,380
You were aiming for it!

1397
01:33:38,380 --> 01:33:40,380
You're the one who got hit!

1398
01:33:43,380 --> 01:33:46,380
Hamada, Yamasaki, out!

1399
01:33:50,380 --> 01:33:51,380
It's Gold-san.

1400
01:33:51,380 --> 01:33:52,380
No, it's not Gold-san.

1401
01:33:52,380 --> 01:33:53,380
It's Gold-san.

1402
01:33:53,380 --> 01:33:54,380
I'm scared.

1403
01:33:54,380 --> 01:33:55,380
Gold-san.

1404
01:34:01,380 --> 01:34:02,380
That's not it.

1405
01:34:02,380 --> 01:34:04,380
It's not Gold-san.

1406
01:34:06,380 --> 01:34:09,380
It's 3 o'clock in the morning, and the three of them go back to the hot spring.

1407
01:34:09,380 --> 01:34:12,380
But there's a strange trap there, too.

1408
01:34:12,380 --> 01:34:37,380
I wonder what it is.

1409
01:34:42,380 --> 01:34:43,380
I wonder what it is.

1410
01:34:44,380 --> 01:34:46,380
It's 3 o'clock in the morning, and the three of them go back to the hot spring.

1411
01:34:47,380 --> 01:34:48,380
But there's a strange trap there, too.

1412
01:34:49,380 --> 01:34:50,380
I wonder what it is.

1413
01:34:51,380 --> 01:34:56,380
It's 3 o'clock in the morning, and the three of them go back to the hot spring.

1414
01:34:57,380 --> 01:34:59,380
But there's a strange trap there, too.

1415
01:35:05,380 --> 01:35:06,380
No!

1416
01:35:09,380 --> 01:35:10,380
No!

1417
01:35:10,380 --> 01:35:15,380
What's going on?

1418
01:35:15,380 --> 01:35:16,380
You didn't see it, did you?

1419
01:35:16,380 --> 01:35:17,380
I didn't see it at all.

1420
01:35:21,380 --> 01:35:22,380
Watch out!

1421
01:35:22,380 --> 01:35:23,380
Watch out!

1422
01:35:23,380 --> 01:35:24,380
Are you okay?

1423
01:35:26,380 --> 01:35:27,380
It's hot.

1424
01:35:27,380 --> 01:35:28,380
It's hot.

1425
01:35:31,380 --> 01:35:32,380
It's hot.

1426
01:35:32,380 --> 01:35:36,380
It's hot.

1427
01:35:40,380 --> 01:35:41,380
It's hot.

1428
01:35:41,380 --> 01:36:02,380
It's from the forest.

1429
01:36:02,380 --> 01:36:04,380
It suddenly got hot.

1430
01:36:04,380 --> 01:36:09,380
That's right.

1431
01:36:09,380 --> 01:36:23,380
Tanaka, let's go.

1432
01:36:23,380 --> 01:36:27,380
Hamada, out.

1433
01:36:27,380 --> 01:36:28,380
It was scary.

1434
01:36:28,380 --> 01:36:29,380
It was scary.

1435
01:36:29,380 --> 01:36:32,380
I was scared too.

1436
01:36:32,380 --> 01:36:36,380
It's gold.

1437
01:36:36,380 --> 01:36:40,380
It was on the right side.

1438
01:36:40,380 --> 01:36:46,380
It's hot, isn't it?

1439
01:36:46,380 --> 01:36:53,380
It's really hot.

1440
01:36:53,380 --> 01:37:05,380
I like it.

1441
01:37:05,380 --> 01:37:18,380
It's hot.

1442
01:37:18,380 --> 01:37:29,380
Stop it.

1443
01:37:29,380 --> 01:37:36,380
It hurts.

1444
01:37:36,380 --> 01:37:57,380
It's amazing.

1445
01:37:57,380 --> 01:37:58,380
It hurts.

1446
01:37:58,380 --> 01:38:06,380
It's amazing.

1447
01:38:06,380 --> 01:38:20,380
It hurts.

1448
01:38:20,380 --> 01:38:28,380
There is a specialty in this inn.

1449
01:38:28,380 --> 01:38:30,380
It's a party.

1450
01:38:30,380 --> 01:38:32,380
Let's go.

1451
01:38:32,380 --> 01:38:33,380
Is it a different room?

1452
01:38:33,380 --> 01:38:36,380
Of course not.

1453
01:38:36,380 --> 01:38:38,380
It's amazing.

1454
01:38:38,380 --> 01:38:41,380
It's a night show.

1455
01:38:41,380 --> 01:38:45,380
Hamada, please enjoy it.

1456
01:38:45,380 --> 01:38:47,380
Please enjoy it.

1457
01:38:47,380 --> 01:38:56,380
Shall we go?

1458
01:38:56,380 --> 01:39:07,380
Let's go.

1459
01:39:07,380 --> 01:39:17,380
It hurts.

1460
01:39:17,380 --> 01:39:30,380
Let's go.

1461
01:39:30,380 --> 01:39:33,380
What are you doing?

1462
01:39:33,380 --> 01:39:38,380
Let's go.

1463
01:39:38,380 --> 01:39:46,380
I'm sorry.

1464
01:39:46,380 --> 01:40:00,380
It hurts.

1465
01:40:00,380 --> 01:40:10,380
Let's go.

1466
01:40:10,380 --> 01:40:13,380
Hamada, you should come here.

1467
01:40:13,380 --> 01:40:20,380
The angle is bad.

1468
01:40:20,380 --> 01:40:28,380
What are you doing?

1469
01:40:28,380 --> 01:40:32,380
Let's go.

1470
01:40:32,380 --> 01:40:38,380
It hurts.

1471
01:40:38,380 --> 01:40:39,380
I understand.

1472
01:40:39,380 --> 01:40:52,380
Let's go.

1473
01:40:52,380 --> 01:40:58,380
Hamada, please wait.

1474
01:40:58,380 --> 01:41:02,380
Let's go.

1475
01:41:02,380 --> 01:41:04,380
It hurts.

1476
01:41:04,380 --> 01:41:10,380
Let's go.

1477
01:41:10,380 --> 01:41:15,380
It hurts.

1478
01:41:15,380 --> 01:41:18,380
It hurts.

1479
01:41:18,380 --> 01:41:24,380
After leaving the room, they go to the night show.

1480
01:41:24,380 --> 01:41:29,380
The punishment game escalates at the night show.

1481
01:41:29,380 --> 01:41:37,380
Who will be the winner?

1482
01:41:37,380 --> 01:41:41,380
Welcome.

1483
01:41:41,380 --> 01:41:48,380
We will give you a fun dinner show.

1484
01:41:48,380 --> 01:41:53,380
The superstar of the Showa era is here.

1485
01:41:53,380 --> 01:42:07,380
Please welcome him.

1486
01:42:07,380 --> 01:42:13,380
It's so cute.

1487
01:42:13,380 --> 01:42:38,380
I can see the end of my life.

1488
01:42:38,380 --> 01:42:50,380
It hurts.

1489
01:42:50,380 --> 01:42:58,380
It hurts.

1490
01:42:58,380 --> 01:43:17,380
Let's go to the night show.

1491
01:43:17,380 --> 01:43:26,380
Cool.

1492
01:43:26,380 --> 01:43:33,380
Hamada, Yamasaki, out.

1493
01:43:33,380 --> 01:43:36,380
It hurts.

1494
01:43:36,380 --> 01:43:39,380
Please come here.

1495
01:43:39,380 --> 01:43:44,380
Next is Yoshimoto.

1496
01:43:44,380 --> 01:43:47,380
Please welcome him.

1497
01:43:47,380 --> 01:43:55,380
Yamashita.

1498
01:43:55,380 --> 01:44:10,380
Yamashita, out.

1499
01:44:10,380 --> 01:44:18,380
Hikunenji.

1500
01:44:18,380 --> 01:44:31,380
Hikunenji, out.

1501
01:44:31,380 --> 01:44:49,380
Next is a fresh new wave.

1502
01:44:49,380 --> 01:44:53,380
I will do an impersonation.

1503
01:44:53,380 --> 01:44:56,380
Showa style radio.

1504
01:44:56,380 --> 01:45:03,380
Put your lips on a red apple.

1505
01:45:03,380 --> 01:45:05,380
Showa 20th Anniversary.

1506
01:45:05,380 --> 01:45:06,380
The Japanese army is defeated.

1507
01:45:06,380 --> 01:45:11,380
The Japanese army is defeated.

1508
01:45:11,380 --> 01:45:13,380
Next is

1509
01:45:13,380 --> 01:45:35,380
Katsura.

1510
01:45:35,380 --> 01:45:36,380
Next is

1511
01:45:36,380 --> 01:45:40,380
Katsura.

1512
01:45:40,380 --> 01:45:45,380
Please welcome him.

1513
01:45:45,380 --> 01:45:51,380
Please come here.

1514
01:45:51,380 --> 01:45:56,380
Please welcome him.

1515
01:45:56,380 --> 01:46:03,380
He came to see the show.

1516
01:46:03,380 --> 01:46:06,380
Yamasaki, Tanaka, out.

1517
01:46:06,380 --> 01:46:14,380
It was fun.

1518
01:46:14,380 --> 01:46:19,380
It was suitable for the night show.

1519
01:46:19,380 --> 01:46:21,380
It will be a good memory.

1520
01:46:21,380 --> 01:46:24,380
Next is a big veteran.

1521
01:46:24,380 --> 01:46:42,380
Please welcome them.

1522
01:46:42,380 --> 01:47:09,380
Please come here.

1523
01:47:09,380 --> 01:47:35,380
Please come here.

1524
01:47:35,380 --> 01:47:46,380
He looks like him.

1525
01:47:46,380 --> 01:47:50,380
Yamasaki, out.

1526
01:47:50,380 --> 01:48:01,380
I can't help it.

1527
01:48:01,380 --> 01:48:05,380
At 4 a.m., the night show is over.

1528
01:48:05,380 --> 01:48:09,380
It's time for the three of them to go to bed.

1529
01:48:09,380 --> 01:48:26,380
However...

1530
01:48:26,380 --> 01:48:29,380
I was sleepy.

1531
01:48:29,380 --> 01:48:31,380
I also want to sleep.

1532
01:48:31,380 --> 01:48:39,380
I woke up.

1533
01:48:39,380 --> 01:49:04,380
I can't help it.

1534
01:49:04,380 --> 01:49:16,380
I can't help it.

1535
01:49:16,380 --> 01:49:21,380
I don't know what to do.

1536
01:49:21,380 --> 01:49:24,380
I don't know what to do.

1537
01:49:24,380 --> 01:49:29,380
I don't know what to do.

1538
01:49:29,380 --> 01:49:32,380
Hamada, Yamasaki, out.

1539
01:49:32,380 --> 01:49:58,380
I can't help it.

1540
01:49:58,380 --> 01:50:18,380
I can't help it.

1541
01:50:18,380 --> 01:50:23,380
I don't know what to do.

1542
01:50:23,380 --> 01:50:30,380
I can't help it.

1543
01:50:30,380 --> 01:50:32,380
I'm sorry.

1544
01:50:32,380 --> 01:50:44,380
I'm going to wash up.

1545
01:50:44,380 --> 01:51:01,380
I can't help it.

1546
01:51:01,380 --> 01:51:16,380
I can't help it.

1547
01:51:16,380 --> 01:51:34,380
I can't help it.

1548
01:51:34,380 --> 01:51:59,380
I can't help it.

1549
01:51:59,380 --> 01:52:21,380
I can't help it.

1550
01:52:21,380 --> 01:52:41,380
Hamada, out.

1551
01:52:41,380 --> 01:52:45,380
The three of them went to bed.

1552
01:52:45,380 --> 01:52:53,380
They woke up at 7 a.m.

1553
01:52:53,380 --> 01:52:58,380
Wake up, everyone.

1554
01:52:58,380 --> 01:53:01,380
Wake up.

1555
01:53:01,380 --> 01:53:03,380
Wake up, everyone.

1556
01:53:03,380 --> 01:53:13,380
The fun punishment game is still going on.

1557
01:53:13,380 --> 01:53:18,380
Yamasaki, wake up.

1558
01:53:18,380 --> 01:53:21,380
Hamada, out.

1559
01:53:21,380 --> 01:53:25,380
I forgot.

1560
01:53:25,380 --> 01:53:28,380
What is it?

1561
01:53:28,380 --> 01:53:35,380
It's like a house.

1562
01:53:35,380 --> 01:53:38,380
I'm going to wash up.

1563
01:53:38,380 --> 01:53:40,380
I'm going to wash up.

1564
01:53:40,380 --> 01:53:43,380
The three of them went to bed.

1565
01:53:43,380 --> 01:53:48,380
They woke up at 7 a.m.

1566
01:53:48,380 --> 01:53:50,380
Hamada, you're the director of the day.

1567
01:53:50,380 --> 01:53:51,380
Yes.

1568
01:53:51,380 --> 01:53:52,380
You're going to write a sports newspaper, right?

1569
01:53:52,380 --> 01:54:05,380
Yes.

1570
01:54:05,380 --> 01:54:15,380
It's delicious.

1571
01:54:15,380 --> 01:54:18,380
You're not eating meat again.

1572
01:54:18,380 --> 01:54:20,380
He's weak.

1573
01:54:20,380 --> 01:54:22,380
He's weak.

1574
01:54:22,380 --> 01:54:24,380
You're not eating meat again.

1575
01:54:24,380 --> 01:54:25,380
You're not eating meat again.

1576
01:54:25,380 --> 01:54:26,380
You're not eating meat again.

1577
01:54:26,380 --> 01:54:36,380
You're not eating meat again.

1578
01:54:36,380 --> 01:54:38,380
It's really delicious.

1579
01:54:38,380 --> 01:54:40,380
I've been calling you for a long time.

1580
01:54:40,380 --> 01:54:43,380
You did a great job today.

1581
01:54:43,380 --> 01:54:44,380
It was fun.

1582
01:54:44,380 --> 01:54:46,380
He wrote down the details.

1583
01:54:46,380 --> 01:54:49,380
He wrote down the details of the game.

1584
01:54:49,380 --> 01:54:55,380
I've been drinking since morning.

1585
01:54:55,380 --> 01:54:59,380
I'm going to read the name of the newspaper.

1586
01:54:59,380 --> 01:55:01,380
Escargoman.

1587
01:55:01,380 --> 01:55:02,380
Escargoman.

1588
01:55:02,380 --> 01:55:05,380
Escargoman.

1589
01:55:05,380 --> 01:55:06,380
Is this an interview?

1590
01:55:06,380 --> 01:55:11,380
This newspaper was made just like a real sports newspaper.

1591
01:55:11,380 --> 01:55:19,380
There was a surprising match between Dynamite and Shikoku.

1592
01:55:19,380 --> 01:55:29,380
Shikoku challenged the champion Escargoman, but he was defeated in 58 seconds from the start of the game.

1593
01:55:29,380 --> 01:55:33,380
I lost in 58 seconds.

1594
01:55:33,380 --> 01:55:38,380
I lost in 58 seconds.

1595
01:55:38,380 --> 01:55:46,380
I lost in 58 seconds.

1596
01:55:46,380 --> 01:55:52,380
I lost in 58 seconds.

1597
01:55:52,380 --> 01:55:54,380
It hurts.

1598
01:55:54,380 --> 01:55:56,380
It hurts.

1599
01:55:56,380 --> 01:56:14,380
It hurts.

1600
01:56:14,380 --> 01:56:34,380
It hurts.

1601
01:56:34,380 --> 01:56:35,380
This is bad.

1602
01:56:35,380 --> 01:56:39,380
This is bad.

1603
01:56:39,380 --> 01:56:44,380
This is bad.

1604
01:56:44,380 --> 01:56:49,380
This is bad.

1605
01:56:49,380 --> 01:57:01,380
This is bad.

1606
01:57:01,380 --> 01:57:12,380
This is bad.

1607
01:57:12,380 --> 01:57:22,380
This is bad.

1608
01:57:22,380 --> 01:57:31,380
This is bad.

1609
01:57:31,380 --> 01:57:38,380
This is bad.

1610
01:57:38,380 --> 01:57:59,380
This is bad.

1611
01:57:59,380 --> 01:58:09,380
This is bad.

1612
01:58:09,380 --> 01:58:19,380
This is bad.

1613
01:58:19,380 --> 01:58:29,380
This is bad.

1614
01:58:29,380 --> 01:58:38,380
This is bad.

1615
01:58:38,380 --> 01:58:49,380
This is bad.

1616
01:58:49,380 --> 01:58:55,380
This is bad.

1617
01:58:55,380 --> 01:59:03,380
This is bad.

1618
01:59:03,380 --> 01:59:05,380
Ah, it hurts!

1619
01:59:05,380 --> 01:59:08,380
He's already passed the check-out.

1620
01:59:14,380 --> 01:59:15,380
Why?

1621
01:59:16,380 --> 01:59:22,380
The check-out time is approaching, so shall we go to the lobby?

1622
01:59:23,380 --> 01:59:29,380
The check-out time is approaching, so shall we go to the lobby?

1623
01:59:29,380 --> 01:59:32,380
It's Hanada.

1624
01:59:34,380 --> 01:59:35,380
It's close, it's close.

1625
01:59:35,380 --> 01:59:36,380
It's close!

1626
01:59:40,380 --> 01:59:42,380
Hanada, out!

1627
01:59:42,380 --> 01:59:47,380
Hanada, out!

1628
01:59:47,380 --> 01:59:49,380
What is this?

1629
01:59:55,380 --> 01:59:56,380
It's here.

1630
01:59:56,380 --> 01:59:58,380
It's here.

1631
02:00:00,380 --> 02:00:02,380
Why did he pick up the money at the end?

1632
02:00:04,380 --> 02:00:06,380
Why did he pick up the money at the end?

1633
02:00:06,380 --> 02:00:08,380
Hanada, out!

1634
02:00:10,380 --> 02:00:15,380
The employees are here, so let's say hello to them.

1635
02:00:16,380 --> 02:00:18,380
Stand in a line.

1636
02:00:19,380 --> 02:00:21,380
Hanada, out.

1637
02:00:22,380 --> 02:00:24,380
Stand in a line.

1638
02:00:24,380 --> 02:00:27,380
Thank you for your hard work over the past two days.

1639
02:00:27,380 --> 02:00:29,380
Thank you for your hard work.

1640
02:00:29,380 --> 02:00:36,380
We have prepared a small gift from the employees.

1641
02:00:36,380 --> 02:00:41,380
Thank you for your hard work over the past two days.

1642
02:00:55,380 --> 02:01:01,380
Everyone, I ask for your cooperation.

1643
02:01:01,380 --> 02:01:08,380
One, two, three!

1644
02:01:08,380 --> 02:01:10,380
Chikaku! Chikaku!

1645
02:01:10,380 --> 02:01:12,380
Shinkaku! Shinkaku!

1646
02:01:15,380 --> 02:01:18,380
Hanada! Hanada!

1647
02:01:18,380 --> 02:01:20,380
Chikaku! Chikaku!

1648
02:01:20,380 --> 02:01:23,380
Shinkaku! Shinkaku!

1649
02:01:23,380 --> 02:01:25,380
I'm sorry.

1650
02:01:25,380 --> 02:01:27,380
I'm sorry.

1651
02:01:27,380 --> 02:01:29,380
I'm sorry.

1652
02:01:29,380 --> 02:01:31,380
Ouch!

1653
02:01:35,380 --> 02:01:37,380
The last one is the best.

1654
02:01:41,380 --> 02:01:43,380
What are you doing?

1655
02:01:43,380 --> 02:01:45,380
What are you doing?

1656
02:01:49,380 --> 02:01:51,380
Don't sing like that.

1657
02:01:51,380 --> 02:01:53,380
Don't sing like that.

1658
02:02:11,380 --> 02:02:13,380
It was funny.

1659
02:02:13,380 --> 02:02:15,380
It was funny.

1660
02:02:15,380 --> 02:02:17,380
You were the best.

1661
02:02:17,380 --> 02:02:19,380
Thank you.

1662
02:02:19,380 --> 02:02:21,380
I was the best when I was in Fukuyama.

1663
02:02:21,380 --> 02:02:23,380
I'm 52 years old.

1664
02:02:23,380 --> 02:02:25,380
The number is different.

1665
02:02:25,380 --> 02:02:27,380
I have been on the search more than 20 times.

1666
02:02:29,380 --> 02:02:31,380
I will sing the last song.

1667
02:02:31,380 --> 02:02:33,380
That song is very beautiful.

1668
02:02:33,380 --> 02:02:35,380
That song is very beautiful.

1669
02:02:35,380 --> 02:02:37,380
That song is very beautiful.

1670
02:02:37,380 --> 02:02:39,380
That song is very beautiful.

1671
02:02:39,380 --> 02:02:41,380
This song is very beautiful.

1672
02:02:41,380 --> 02:02:49,380
This song is very profound.

1673
02:02:49,380 --> 02:02:53,380
This song is very beautiful.

1674
02:02:53,380 --> 02:02:55,380
This is beautiful.

1675
02:02:55,380 --> 02:02:57,380
This is very beautiful.

1676
02:02:57,380 --> 02:02:59,380
This is amazing.

1677
02:02:59,380 --> 02:03:01,380
This is amazing.

1678
02:03:01,380 --> 02:03:03,380
This is amazing.

1679
02:03:05,380 --> 02:03:07,380
Baka, the last one.

1680
02:03:07,380 --> 02:03:09,380
Baka, the last one.

1681
02:03:09,380 --> 02:03:11,380
That's it?

1682
02:03:13,380 --> 02:03:15,380
Don't sing like that!

1683
02:03:15,380 --> 02:03:17,380
There's no such thing.

1684
02:03:17,380 --> 02:03:19,380
But you're singing.

1685
02:03:19,380 --> 02:03:20,380
That's right.

1686
02:03:20,380 --> 02:03:22,380
You're singing the best beat.

1687
02:03:22,380 --> 02:03:24,380
Who cares about the world?

1688
02:03:32,380 --> 02:03:33,380
Is that all?

1689
02:03:33,380 --> 02:03:35,380
Yes, that's about it.

1690
02:03:35,380 --> 02:03:37,380
Thank you.

1691
02:03:37,380 --> 02:03:39,380
Let's go.
