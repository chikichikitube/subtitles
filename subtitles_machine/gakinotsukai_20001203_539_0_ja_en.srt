00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Last week and two weeks ago, the comedians who were damaged by Matsumoto's money-spending were held in a funeral.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
O-choko Matsumoto, Seko Seko trial!

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
You should say that, not that!

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
This!

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
This is you!

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Wake up!

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
This is you!

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Matsumoto, the defendant, was forced to file a lawsuit, but the result was a crime.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
He was fined 1,000,000 yen for using his money.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
And later, a hearing was held on how to use the 1,000,000 yen.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:51,000
We were told to have fun with the 1,000,000 yen.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I think people who watch TV can expect that.

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I will prepare both the audience and the car.

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
The audience will be included?

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
But if you say that, having a guest is like having an event.

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,000
If I participate in that event, it would be strange if there was a gala.

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
In fact, I have to receive it.

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
If you look at Matsumoto's request at the school festival, it won't work.

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
This is a crime.

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
It's a crime.

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
It's a crime.

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I don't know how to use the 1,000,000 yen.

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I don't know why there was a fine of 1,000,000 yen.

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
But the verdict is 1,000,000 yen.

25
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
What about you?

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I didn't win the trial.

27
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Then I'm the one who lost the trial.

28
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
It's okay.

29
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Isn't it a crime?

30
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
You pushed me so much.

31
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I see.

32
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
You pushed me.

33
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
You messed up my personality.

34
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
You pushed me.

35
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
What is your responsibility?

36
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Why are you responsible for me?

37
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
You are you, and I will definitely do the trial someday.

38
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
What trial?

39
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
End is end.

40
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
You are a complete asshole.

41
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I'm not an asshole.

42
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I'm not an asshole.

43
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
You chose this jersey yourself.

44
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
It's a papillon.

45
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
That's a complete asshole.

46
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I'm not an asshole.

47
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Please think about it this time.

48
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:45,000
It's a miracle that you can become one with the people on the scene.

49
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:52,000
How will Matsumoto use the 1,000,000 yen that Matsumoto entrusted to himself?

50
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
1,000,000 yen.

51
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Thank you.

52
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
This program is sponsored by the sponsor you see.

53
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
And finally, on the day of the execution.

54
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
We are heading to Tokyo Summerland.

55
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
We have prepared a place and 500 people today.

56
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
500 people in this cold weather.

57
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
If you're not a leader of the Yopponobo tribe, you can't win.

58
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
That's right.

59
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
If you don't have that much power, you can't win.

60
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Shut up. What are you talking about?

61
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
What are you talking about?

62
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
You're thinking about how to use the 1,000,000 yen.

63
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Of course I'm thinking about it.

64
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Really?

65
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Yes.

66
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I've been thinking about what kind of character I'm going to be as a comedian.

67
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
My comedy style is healing.

68
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
What?

69
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Wait a minute.

70
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
You're not being healed.

71
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I'm not being healed at all.

72
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
You came all the way here to heal.

73
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I see.

74
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I see.

75
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I don't think so.

76
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I've never been healed.

77
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
It's the opposite.

78
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
It's the opposite.

79
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,000
So I thought I'd like to heal the 500 people.

80
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:29,000
So I thought I'd like to show everyone a 1,000,000 yen fireworks show.

81
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Shut up.

82
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Fireworks?

83
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Fireworks.

84
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
1,000,000 yen?

85
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Yes.

86
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Normally you can see it in the summer.

87
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
You can see it if you go somewhere.

88
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
But you said you wanted to see fireworks in the winter. Can you see it?

89
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I've never seen it.

90
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:54,000
So I thought I'd like to show fireworks in this cold weather.

91
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
But it's worth 1,000,000 yen.

92
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
That's right.

93
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
That's amazing.

94
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
That's amazing.

95
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
It's worth 1,000,000 yen.

96
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I thought about it a lot.

97
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I see.

98
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Do you have 1,000,000 yen now?

99
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
No, I don't have 1,000,000 yen.

100
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I'm not a person who carries 1,000,000 yen.

101
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I have 2,000,000 yen.

102
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
That's not true.

103
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I don't have 1,000,000 yen.

104
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Do you have 1,000,000 yen?

105
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Yes.

106
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
That's right.

107
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
It's healing.

108
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
But if you have a bank, show me.

109
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I have 1,000,000 yen.

110
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Really?

111
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
You have 1,000,000 yen.

112
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Is that true?

113
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Look at it from behind.

114
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I don't know what it is.

115
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I'll go first.

116
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Ah, there's a normal person behind you.

117
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I'm sure you've seen a lot of things.

118
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
That's right.

119
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
It's suspicious that it's a child.

120
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
That's strange.

121
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
You've seen too much.

122
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
You've definitely seen too much.

123
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I don't remember how many times I've seen it.

124
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I don't know.

125
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Now, it's your turn.

126
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
What is it?

127
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
It's a big one.

128
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Run away.

129
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Hurry up and get on the bus.

130
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Why are you coming back?

131
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
What is it?

132
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Wow, amazing.

133
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
What is it?

134
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
If you've seen this much fireworks, it's a good time.

135
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I can enjoy it.

136
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
What did you see?

137
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I can't see anything.

138
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I didn't want to see that.

139
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
What was that face?

140
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
It was like this.

141
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:50,000
The bus arrived at Tokyo Summerland, a venue where you can enjoy a million-yen fireworks.

142
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
We're almost at the venue.

143
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
It's getting dark.

144
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I'm looking forward to it.

145
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:06,000
We've been preparing for this for days.

146
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
There's a lot of people here.

147
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
It's a little cold.

148
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
There's a lot of people here.

149
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
They're all ready.

150
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
They're all ready.

151
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Sit here.

152
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Here?

153
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Sit here.

154
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
You're mistaken.

155
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
It's getting dark.

156
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
It's getting dark.

157
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
It's almost 10 minutes to go.

158
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
It's almost 10 minutes to go.

159
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Meanwhile, the fireworks were almost ready.

160
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,000
On the other hand, the audience who came to enjoy the fireworks at Matsumoto was happy.

161
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
All that's left is to wait for the members to show up.

162
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,000
There's something I want to show you.

163
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
You're not going to do it yet?

164
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I'm not going to do it.

165
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
The audience isn't completely out of breath yet.

166
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Wait a minute.

167
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
You can't be completely out of breath.

168
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I'll leave it until my mouth turns into a paste.

169
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
You know what I mean, right?

170
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I want to tell you what fireworks are.

171
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I know what fireworks are.

172
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I've seen fireworks before.

173
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
But when you're asked what fireworks are,

174
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
For example, when a child is born,

175
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
What do you explain when your father asks you what fireworks are?

176
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
What do you mean?

177
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
You can't even explain it.

178
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Are you going to blow it up now?

179
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Think about it.

180
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Do you understand?

181
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Yes.

182
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Look carefully.

183
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Go.

184
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,000
The Japanese fireworks are divided into three parts by their structure.

185
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Fireworks that create large, round fireworks.

186
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Pokamono, which is often used in sports events.

187
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,000
And the small firework in the middle.

188
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Speaking of fireworks, it's a firework.

189
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I've been doing it since I made it.

190
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
How many minutes does this take?

191
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
When a firework opens in the night sky,

192
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
It spreads like a round stick and fights.

193
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
That's a firework.

194
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,000
The Japanese fireworks are divided into stars and parts.

195
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:44,000
It's called the representative firework.

196
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
That's a big feature.

197
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
The firework changes every time.

198
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
What?

199
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
It's all over the place.

200
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
It's too loud to hear the sound.

201
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:01,000
The assembly of the firework begins with the inner core.

202
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:07,000
The stars and parts are placed alternately in the paper.

203
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
When the parts are put in and the lower half of the firework is assembled,

204
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:20,000
The inner core is put in and the rest is finished.

205
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
It will be completed soon.

206
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
It's almost done.

207
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Where did you cry?

208
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Where did you cry?

209
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I didn't cry.

210
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I didn't think of anything.

211
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
There's nothing around the firework.

212
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Firework?

213
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
That's a name.

214
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
That's right.

215
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
It looks like a firework.

216
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
It looks like a firework.

217
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Let's go see it.

218
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Let's go.

219
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Let's look at the history of fireworks.

220
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Let's look at the history of fireworks.

221
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
The history of fireworks?

222
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
The history of fireworks.

223
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
When did the fireworks spread to Japan?

224
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
How did it become a firework?

225
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I want you to see it.

226
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Do you understand?

227
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
The history is good.

228
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
It's good.

229
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I'll show you the time.

230
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I haven't been able to prepare for today's event yet.

231
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Really?

232
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I'm wearing makeup right now.

233
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
We don't have to worry about that.

234
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Let's look back.

235
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
The history of fireworks.

236
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Where did you get it from?

237
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
This VTR.

238
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Where did you find it?

239
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:05,000
The original firework of fireworks was invented in ancient China about 1700 years ago.

240
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:11,000
It was the birth of the so-called black-colored firework.

241
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:17,000
This black-colored firework, which is made by mixing wood, oil, and small stones,

242
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:24,000
will eventually spread to all over the world from China to the Middle East and Europe.

243
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
It came to Japan in 1543.

244
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:34,000
It came to Tanegashima with the Hinagajū.

245
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
The beginning of Japan's fireworks.

246
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I don't know how long ago it was.

247
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I don't know.

248
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I don't know.

249
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I don't know.

250
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Finally, it was banned from manufacturing, selling, and using fireworks in the middle of the city.

251
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
It seems that fireworks became popular until the firework came out.

252
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Hey, how was it?

253
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Did you see it well?

254
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
It would have been better if you had seen it before.

255
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I saw it.

256
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Hey, how was it?

257
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I saw it.

258
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Where did you suck your nose?

259
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I sucked my nose.

260
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
After all, there is no such thing as crying.

261
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
There is no such thing as crying.

262
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
There is no such thing as crying.

263
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
What are you guys?

264
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Oh, what are you guys?

265
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Oh, what are you guys?

266
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Oh, what are you guys?

267
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I'm angry.

268
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
It can't be helped.

269
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I'm angry. I'm angry.

270
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:46,000
You should get on the bus. We spent a lot of money on it.

271
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Are you ready?

272
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
What's the matter?

273
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
What's the matter?

274
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Shut up.

275
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Shut up.

276
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Wait.

277
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Well...

278
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
It's your turn.

279
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
You guys are also funny.

280
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Fireworks in the world.

281
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Fireworks in the world.

282
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Please be patient.

283
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
It doesn't matter.

284
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Do you think so?

285
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I'll give you a hint.

286
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Do you know English?

287
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
You don't know?

288
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
You don't know English?

289
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Here you go.

290
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Fireworks.

291
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Fireworks is a firework.

292
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
You are terrible.

293
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
What?

294
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I came to see you again.

295
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
That's not the point.

296
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Please give me an A.

297
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Please give me an A.

298
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Please enjoy it more.

299
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Please enjoy it more.

300
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Please enjoy it more.

301
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Please enjoy it more.

302
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
German.

303
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Firebear.

304
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Say it.

305
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Firebear.

306
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Say it.

307
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Italian.

308
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Forky-darty-future.

309
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Say it.

310
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Forky-darty-future.

311
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Say it like this.

312
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Forky-darty-future.

313
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Say it like this.

314
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Can't you say it louder?

315
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
French.

316
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Rue-fou-darty-fus.

317
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Say it.

318
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Say it again.

319
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Say it again?

320
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Forky-darty-future.

321
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Say it again from the top.

322
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Really?

323
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Fireworks.

324
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Firebear.

325
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Forky-darty-future.

326
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Forky-darty-future.

327
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Forky-darty-future.

328
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
With that being said,

329
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Alright, finally

330
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
It's so dark

331
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
It's so dark

332
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Finally, for everyone

333
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Are you ready?

334
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
The fireworks you're about to see

335
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
How much does it cost?

336
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
1, 2

337
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
1 million yen

338
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
That's right, the 1 million yen fireworks

339
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
From now on

340
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Let's go see it

341
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Wow

342
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
This is amazing

343
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
This isn't just for 7 or 8 people

344
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
No, no, no

345
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
From the start

346
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
This is amazing

347
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
This is amazing

348
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Matsumoto's 1 million yen

349
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Let's use the 1 million yen

350
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Thank you

351
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Thank you

352
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Thank you for coming

353
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Thank you

354
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Thank you

355
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Thank you

356
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Everyone

357
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Thank you for coming

358
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Thank you

359
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Finally

360
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Matsumoto's trial

361
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
The day has come

362
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
The day has come

363
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
This is

364
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
This is a lot of expectations

365
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
That's right

366
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
It's a lot of expectations

367
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
It's been a while since we've gathered

368
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
And done something like this

369
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
For this program

370
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I'm a little happy

371
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I'm a little excited

372
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Today's star

373
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
O-choko Matsumoto

374
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
O-choko

375
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Matsumoto

376
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
1 million yen

377
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
What will you use it for?

378
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
1 million yen

379
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I'll give you a 1 million yen fireworks

380
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
1 million yen

381
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
This is amazing

382
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I'll say it again

383
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I didn't do anything wrong

384
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I still think that the trial was strange

385
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
But they

386
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,000
They are the parasites of the comedy world

387
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
They

388
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
What are you talking about?

389
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Let's do it

390
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I'll do it

391
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Before that

392
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
The history of fireworks

393
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I said it earlier

394
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
We were told

395
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Everyone was waiting

396
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,000
We were told to show a video of the history of fireworks

397
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I'm sorry

398
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Everyone, the fireworks will go up from this side

399
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
It's going up

400
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I'm really going to give out 1 million yen

401
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
It's a 1 million yen fireworks

402
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I really want to give it out

403
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
You've seen it in many places

404
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I'm doing it with my own money

405
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
You can see it with your own money

406
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,000
It's probably the first time I've seen fireworks with my own money

407
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
That's right

408
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Really

409
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Let's go

410
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Everyone

411
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Is it okay?

412
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Let's count from 10 seconds ago

413
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Okay

414
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Let's go

415
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Fire

416
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
10

417
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
9

418
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
8

419
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
7

420
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
5

421
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
4

422
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
3

423
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
2

424
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
1

425
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
0

426
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Wow

427
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Wow

428
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Wow

429
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Thank you very much

430
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
What?

431
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Is it over?

432
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
What?

433
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
You've been raising your head all the time

434
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
What?

435
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
It's over

436
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
What?

437
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
1 million yen is that much

438
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Really?

439
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
1 million yen is that much

440
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
No

441
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
It's over

442
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
You guys are very expensive

443
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
That's 1 million yen

444
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Wait a minute

445
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Wait a minute

446
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
It's okay

447
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
It's over

448
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
I'm sorry

449
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Is it 1 million yen in one shot?

450
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Is it over?

451
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
No

452
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
That's a lie

453
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
It's 1 million yen in one shot

454
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
It costs 570,000 yen

455
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
That's right

456
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
It's 1 million yen in one shot

457
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
It's 1 million yen

458
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
It's 1 million yen in total

459
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
It's 1 million yen

460
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Wait a minute

461
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Wait a minute

462
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Why is it 1 million yen?

463
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
I can't imagine

464
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
I can't imagine

465
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I've never been told that much

466
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
What is that?

467
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
I can't imagine

468
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
What is that?

469
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
What is this people's voice?

470
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
What is this?

471
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I'm scared of the people

472
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
The fireworks that everyone is watching at the summer festival

473
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
It costs tens of millions

474
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
It's amazing

475
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
It's amazing

476
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
1 million yen is that much

477
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
And I'm the one who gave out the 1 million yen

478
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
I'm the one who gave out the 1 million yen

479
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
I'm the one who gave out the 1 million yen

480
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I'm the one who gave out the 1 million yen

481
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I'm the one who gave out the 1 million yen

482
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Thank you

483
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
You were the one who gave out the 1 million yen

484
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Go home

485
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
He's saying it in English

486
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Everyone, go home

487
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
You'll catch a cold

488
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Wait a minute

489
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I'm scared of the people

490
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Are you listening?

491
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Are you listening?

492
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
1 million yen

493
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
The people are angry

494
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
What do you want to say?

495
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
What do you want to say?

496
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
You're a weak man

497
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
A weak man

498
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
A weak man

499
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
I gave out the 1 million yen

500
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
I showed the fireworks

501
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:48,000
I'm scared

502
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
There's nothing I can do

503
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
That's right

504
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
That's the end of the 1 million yen

505
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
That's why

506
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
I'll close my eyes again

507
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
I'll close my eyes again

508
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
I'll close my eyes

509
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
I'll close my eyes

510
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Thank you

511
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Thank you

512
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Thank you

513
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Thank you

514
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Thank you

515
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Thank you

516
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:56,000
What we did in the end was to make their anger into a video call.

517
