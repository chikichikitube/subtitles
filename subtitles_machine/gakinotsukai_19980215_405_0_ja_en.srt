1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hey, where are you going?

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
I'm sorry.

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
What?

4
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I'm sorry.

5
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
What are you doing?

6
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
I'm Kendo.

7
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Oh!

8
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Can you do it?

9
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I can do it.

10
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I'm really strong.

11
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Do you have a Nandan?

12
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
No, I don't have that.

13
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Excuse me.

14
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
You don't have a Nandan?

15
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I was the head of the club when I was in middle school.

16
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Really?

17
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Yes.

18
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Excuse me.

19
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Excuse me.

20
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I talked to the two of them today.

21
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
But you don't have a job.

22
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
We don't.

23
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
We don't do that.

24
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
You're going to do your best, right?

25
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
No, I won't quit.

26
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
What?

27
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I'm going to do my best with you two.

28
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
You're not going to quit?

29
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm not asking you to quit.

30
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Hey!

31
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm sorry.

32
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I'm sorry.

33
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm sorry.

34
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm going to do my best next year.

35
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
It's hard to go up.

36
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
It's hard.

37
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The top is full.

38
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
That's right.

39
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Many people from Osaka to Yoshimoto are coming to Tokyo.

40
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I think that's one of the reasons.

41
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
If that person is gone, we can go up.

42
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Honestly, the top section.

43
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
It's Hong Kong.

44
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Hong Kong?

45
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Why?

46
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I sometimes get in touch at work, but I hate it.

47
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,600
You guys are so annoying.

48
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,700
We eat together on the special show.

49
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:30,400
I'm concentrating on the show.

50
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,000
But he keeps looking at me.

51
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,700
He asks me how I'm doing.

52
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:36,800
That's not true.

53
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,800
I can't concentrate on the show.

54
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:39,700
That's not true.

55
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,500
When we're on the show together,

56
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:44,800
he's looking at me like this.

57
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,100
Really?

58
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:48,900
He's looking back at me.

59
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,600
We don't look at each other.

60
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,200
We can't look at each other.

61
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,000
I'll show you today.

62
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,300
That's strange.

63
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:59,200
Mr. Kuraoka is coming to Japan Electric today.

64
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,500
He has a camera in his school.

65
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,000
We're going there now.

66
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,200
Mr. Kuraoka doesn't know.

67
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,100
I'll show you how much he hates Hong Kong.

68
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,700
He doesn't hate Hong Kong.

69
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:10,600
I'll see how much he hates Hong Kong.

70
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,000
Then we'll make a decision.

71
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,700
Yes, please.

72
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:15,100
I'll show you how much he hates Hong Kong.

73
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:16,100
Then we'll do it.

74
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:23,900
I'll show you how much he hates Hong Kong.

75
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:27,900
This program is brought to you by the sponsor you are watching.

76
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:33,400
Good morning.

77
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,200
Are you okay?

78
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,100
Are you sick?

79
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:36,300
No, I'm not.

80
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:39,900
We came here to see you.

81
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,200
We heard that you were sick.

82
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,300
I have a cold.

83
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,800
Are you sick again?

84
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,100
I have a cold again.

85
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,300
I have a cold all year round.

86
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:54,500
Do you have a sandwich?

87
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,800
You know that, don't you?

88
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,000
I'm not busy.

89
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,300
I only have three sandwiches.

90
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,900
Do you understand?

91
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,300
I don't know if I can win.

92
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:06,700
I don't know the content.

93
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,800
I know a little about the content.

94
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,200
I don't know the content.

95
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,100
I don't know the content.

96
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:15,800
I don't know the content.

97
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,500
How many years has it been?

98
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,500
It's been six years.

99
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,300
It hurts.

100
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:25,400
It hurts.

101
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,400
It hurts.

102
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,900
It hurts.

103
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:34,700
I don't care if you hit me in the head.

104
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:38,500
Why are you laughing?

105
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:42,100
I told you to hit me in the head.

106
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:43,700
I told you to hit me in the head.

107
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:48,700
Why are you laughing?

108
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:51,700
I'm angry.

109
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:55,300
I'm kidding.

110
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:58,700
We're not kidding.

111
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:01,500
You're the only one who's excited.

112
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:02,500
It's my fault.

113
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,900
I can't see you.

114
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:10,800
You guys are busy with work.

115
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:18,100
It's over today, so I'm going to take a rest for seven days.

116
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:21,500
Seven days?

117
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,500
It's been seven days.

118
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,300
It's terrible.

119
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:26,900
I think so, too.

120
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,800
This is not good.

121
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,900
I don't intend to do that.

122
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,500
I don't intend to do that.

123
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:36,500
It's always like that.

124
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:41,100
I'm going to give this back to you.

125
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:45,900
I'm going to give this back to you.

126
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:50,100
Let's all work together and send it back.

127
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,100
Is that okay?

128
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,100
I don't know what you're talking about.

129
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:57,500
We don't know what you're talking about.

130
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,100
Thank you very much.

131
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:10,500
I have a sense of justice.

132
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,900
Don't move.

133
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:14,100
Don't move.

134
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:21,500
Don't move.

135
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:25,700
Don't move.

136
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,700
Don't move.

137
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:28,500
What?

138
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:33,500
You're fat.

139
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,500
You're not going to eat it, are you?

140
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,300
You're not going to eat it, are you?

141
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:40,100
Why are you so fat?

142
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:40,900
It hurts.

143
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:43,100
I'm sorry.

144
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:43,900
It hurts.

145
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:44,700
I'm sorry.

146
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,300
Don't hit me.

147
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:49,500
It hurts.

148
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,900
Are you really going to eat this?

149
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:51,900
I'm not going to eat it.

150
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,700
I'm not going to eat it.

151
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:57,300
I'm not going to eat it.

152
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,100
What are you doing?

153
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,700
It hurts.

154
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:01,900
I'm going to send you back.

155
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:03,300
Why?

156
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:06,900
I'm going to send you back.

157
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,300
If you're here, my juniors will have a hard time working.

158
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,700
I'm going to send you back.

159
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:12,300
You first.

160
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,900
I'm going to send you back.

161
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:15,700
Don't move.

162
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:18,900
It hurts.

163
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:21,700
What are you doing?

164
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:23,300
I'm going to send you back.

165
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:26,100
It hurts.

166
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:35,500
It hurts.

167
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,700
I won't do it.

168
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:40,100
I'll wrap theã‚“ in your mouth.

169
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,800
we hew his.

170
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,500
Are you okay?

171
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:46,700
I'm fat, why don't you do that?

172
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:47,700
I thought he would die.

173
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:50,900
OK.

174
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:54,100
I'm going to leave it here.

175
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,500
This refrigerated food was bought at the store.

176
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,500
Let's cool it down.

177
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,000
It's good that it's fresh.

178
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
It's not fresh, is it?

179
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
It's not fresh.

180
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,500
He's saying it's hot.

181
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,500
Is he saying it's hot?

182
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,500
He's saying it's hot.

183
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,500
It's smelly.

184
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,500
Let's put it on.

185
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,500
Let's put it on.

186
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:15,500
He's saying it's hot.

187
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,500
It's hot.

188
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,500
It's hot.

189
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,500
Stand up.

190
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,500
Don't do that.

191
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,500
Don't do that.

192
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,500
Don't do that.

193
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:30,500
Don't do that.

194
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,500
Excuse me.

195
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:33,500
Thank you.

196
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:36,500
I can hear your voice.

197
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:43,500
If you come back with this, we'll have to do it again.

198
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:48,500
I'm the only one who can do it.

199
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:52,500
The staff will be like, good job.

200
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,500
No one can say that.

201
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:57,500
But he's really going to the NGK.

202
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,500
I'm a little worried now.

203
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,500
Is it really hot?

204
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:07,500
It's hot.

205
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,500
Don't do that.

206
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,500
It's hot.

207
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,500
It's hot.

208
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,500
Don't do that.

209
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,500
Is it hot?

210
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:26,500
He's really enjoying it.

211
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:31,500
The other day, the player, well, those who watched the show will know,

212
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,500
He made ramen.

213
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,500
He made it, right?

214
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,500
Well, I'm sorry, everyone.

215
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:41,500
We were also surprised.

216
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:44,500
It was so sweet.

217
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:48,500
It's strange that miso and soy sauce are wrong.

218
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,500
I thought it was dirty.

219
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,500
I thought it was dirty.

220
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,500
I thought it was dirty.

221
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,500
Well, that's fine.

222
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,500
I didn't react well to the back.

223
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,500
I went faster than I thought.

224
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:02,500
I wasn't shaking properly.

225
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,500
You weren't shaking.

226
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,500
You weren't shaking.

227
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,500
I wasn't shaking.

228
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,500
I was shaking.

229
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,500
I was shaking.

230
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:12,500
The next day, my stomach was pretty...

231
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,500
It was a strange thing.

232
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,500
My stomach was pretty...

233
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,500
It was a strange thing.

234
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,500
Your stomach is fine.

235
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:21,500
I know your stomach.

236
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:26,500
I had to stop the pain with painkillers.

237
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,500
It was a terrible thing.

238
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,500
I called an ambulance.

239
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,500
You're lying.

240
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,500
I didn't call an ambulance.

241
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,500
I was about to call an ambulance.

242
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,500
I went that far.

243
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:44,500
I was about to throw up.

244
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,500
I thought it was strange.

245
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,500
It was strange.

246
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:50,500
I laughed, too.

247
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:55,500
I don't know where the staff is now.

248
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,500
I don't know where the staff is now.

249
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,500
What do you want me to do?

250
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,500
Money.

251
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,500
Why is that?

252
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:10,500
Do you pay with money?

253
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:14,500
20 million yen.

254
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:17,500
Are you a fool?

255
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:20,500
Why?

256
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:23,500
Why 20 million yen?

257
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:26,500
It was really hard.

258
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:31,500
I sat with the first and second guests.

259
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:36,500
We sat apart like this.

260
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,500
The first guest finished.

261
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,500
I didn't talk much.

262
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,500
He said to me from here.

263
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:45,500
I had a hard time.

264
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,500
What happened?

265
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:52,500
That kid's ramen the other day.

266
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:56,500
It was really hard.

267
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,500
I have a basic physical strength.

268
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,500
I can't stand it.

269
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,500
I have a sense of justice.

270
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,500
I have a sense of justice.

271
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,500
My stomach hurts.

272
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:08,500
I have a sense of duty.

273
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,500
A sense of duty?

274
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:13,500
I have a sense of duty.

275
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,500
I don't know.

276
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,500
I have a sense of duty.

277
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:20,500
I have a sense of duty.

278
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,500
It was really hard.

279
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,500
That's how it was behind the scenes.

280
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:27,500
It was a behind-the-scenes story.

281
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:30,500
If I didn't get hit, it would have been a mistake.

282
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:36,500
You look ugly.

283
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,500
You look ugly, too.

284
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:45,500
I have a feeling.

285
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:49,500
I think I'm going to have a heart attack.

286
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,500
Don't look at my face.

287
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,500
You don't look like a man.

288
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,500
No one said that.

289
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,500
You think so, right?

290
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,500
That's right.

291
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,500
But I'll be clear.

292
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:03,500
You look like a man.

293
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:06,500
You look like a handsome man.

294
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,500
I don't understand.

295
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,500
What do you mean?

296
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:18,500
You look like a handsome man.

297
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,500
You look like a handsome man.

298
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,500
I think you're a handsome man.

299
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:28,500
You look like a man when you're on TV.

300
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,500
You look like you're being watched.

301
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,500
You look like a fool.

302
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:35,500
You look like a fool.

303
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:47,500
It took me about two hours to put on makeup.

304
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:50,500
That's why I look better when I'm on TV.

305
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,500
You look better when you're on TV.

306
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,500
I don't know.

307
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,500
I haven't put on makeup yet.

308
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:58,500
To be honest, it's hard.

309
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:03,500
I can't do it.

310
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:06,500
Sometimes I feel like I'm going to stand up.

311
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:09,500
I can't tell the difference.

312
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,500
I'm excited.

313
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:15,500
Is this a movie?

314
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:21,500
To be honest, I'm glad I became a talent.

315
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,500
That's not true.

316
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,500
That's not true at all.

317
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:28,500
It's the Olympics again.

318
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:32,500
You got a gold medal today.

319
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:35,500
That's right.

320
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:39,500
I think it's amazing if it's meaningful.

321
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,500
Do you understand what I'm saying?

322
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:46,500
Please continue.

323
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:51,500
What are you doing?

324
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:54,500
There's a clay shooting.

325
00:13:54,500 --> 00:14:00,500
I think it's a great movie.

326
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:03,500
There's something like that.

327
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,500
Do you understand?

328
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:09,500
For example, in a marathon, everyone runs.

329
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,500
I think it's amazing that it's fast.

330
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:14,500
I think it's okay to admit it.

331
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:17,500
But there's a game that I don't understand.

332
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:21,500
What are you going to use it for in real life?

333
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:24,500
For example, there's a girl.

334
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:30,500
It's like this.

335
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,500
I understand.

336
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,500
Calm down.

337
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,500
I understand.

338
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,500
I'll wrap you up in a bus.

339
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,500
There's no difference.

340
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,500
When you come back.

341
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:43,500
When are you going to use it?

342
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:47,500
It's good if you go to a ski resort.

343
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:50,500
I don't have to do this.

344
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:56,500
If you do that, it's this.

345
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,500
If you do that, it's curling.

346
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:01,500
That's what you're doing in your life.

347
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,500
My mother will be happy.

348
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:08,500
I'll do this, so you go in.

349
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:11,500
I'm in trouble if you do this.

350
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,500
I'm not in trouble.

351
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,500
Curling itself is strange.

352
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,500
I'm making a big one.

353
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,500
If you do that, it's round.

354
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:23,500
If you roll that and go to the other side.

355
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:28,500
I was told what to do.

356
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:33,500
What are you doing?

357
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:37,500
I've been watching you all the time.

358
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,500
I don't know what to do.

359
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,500
I'm going to do something.

360
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,500
Do you understand if I look at you?

361
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,500
I don't understand.

362
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,500
There's a lot of games.

363
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,500
What's going on?

364
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,500
I don't understand.

365
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,500
What are you guys?

366
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:56,500
Ryuji?

367
00:15:56,500 --> 00:16:00,500
Who is Ryuji?

368
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:06,500
I'm the one who says yes.

369
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:11,500
I'm not going to apologize.

370
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,500
I'm sorry. Apologize.

371
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,500
I don't want to talk.

372
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:21,500
I'm sorry.

373
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,500
Ryuji?

374
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,500
What is it?

375
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,500
What is it?

376
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,500
I'm sorry.

377
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,500
I'm sorry.

378
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:35,500
Say yes.

379
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,500
I understand.

380
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,500
I'll do everything.

381
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,500
I understand.

382
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,500
No.

383
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:46,500
One person is going to slide down the slope.

384
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,500
I see.

385
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,500
Is there such a scene?

386
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,500
Yes.

387
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,500
I've never seen it.

388
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:56,500
I don't like it.

389
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,500
Why are you scared?

390
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:02,500
What are you doing?

391
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,500
I'm sorry.

392
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,500
Stop it.

393
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:10,500
You.

394
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:14,500
I'm sorry. I was just playing around.

395
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:20,500
I've been doing this for a while now, and everyone's crying.

396
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,500
The other day, I cried because of the speed.

397
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,500
I lost my speed.

398
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:44,500
What would you do if you were taken by a camera on a highway?

399
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,500
Have you ever been taken by an Obis?

400
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,500
Of course I have.

401
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,500
Really?

402
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:54,500
Really?

403
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:58,500
When I was in Osaka, I couldn't make it in a few months.

404
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,500
Were you on my side?

405
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,500
I was clearly in the picture.

406
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,500
I was asked to take a picture.

407
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:08,500
Someone next to me asked me if I knew him.

408
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,500
I looked at him and said, it's you.

409
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:19,500
I was clearly in the picture.

410
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,500
I don't remember at all.

411
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:25,500
You were clearly in the picture.

412
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,500
What would you do if you were taken by an Obis?

413
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,500
I was clearly in the picture.

414
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:35,500
I looked at him and saw the owner of the car.

415
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:37,500
I called him.

416
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,500
You were wearing sunglasses.

417
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,500
What would you do if you were taken by an Obis?

418
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,500
I've never done that.

419
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,500
I'm a fool.

420
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,500
I always drive like this.

421
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,500
I don't think this is right.

422
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,500
I drive like this.

423
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:56,500
Why?

424
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,500
I don't know.

425
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,500
I want to hide my nose.

426
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:06,500
If you were in the picture, you would have been taken by an Obis.

427
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,500
This is dangerous.

428
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,500
It's dangerous.

429
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:15,500
If you were in the picture, you would have been taken by an Obis.

430
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,500
Why?

431
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,500
I don't know.

432
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,500
I don't know.

433
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:25,500
I think it's an expression.

434
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,500
There is an expression.

435
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,500
I don't hate him.

436
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,500
I forgive him.

437
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:36,500
If you were in the picture, you would have been taken by an Obis.

438
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,500
I see.

439
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,500
If you were in the picture, you would have been taken by an Obis.

440
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,500
I'm sorry.

441
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,500
Don't let go of my hand.

442
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:48,500
I'm sorry.

443
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,500
If you were in the picture, you would have been taken by an Obis.

444
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:53,500
If I were in the picture, I would have been taken by an Obis.

445
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,500
I'm sorry.

446
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,500
Let's talk.

447
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:02,500
I thought it was dangerous.

448
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,500
I thought you were in the picture.

449
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,500
I thought you were in the picture.

450
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:11,500
I'm running at a high speed, so I can catch the speed.

451
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:13,500
I think so.

452
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,500
You should do this at that high speed.

453
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,500
Of course.

454
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:25,500
I want to raise the speed limit a little before that.

455
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:29,500
The speed limit is 40km per hour.

456
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,500
It's not a problem if you run so fast.

457
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,500
Is that so?

458
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:36,500
There are a lot of them running around

459
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:39,500
Yes, they are running around

460
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:43,500
Even when they turn, it's so hot

461
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:47,500
Are you holding the net upside down?

462
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,500
If you drop it, it's hot

463
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,500
Where are you going?

464
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,500
You're holding the net

465
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:04,500
I have a question for Matsumoto-san

466
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:11,500
Matsumoto-san, when you're talking with your friends like Shizuoka, Shizuoka, Shizuoka, and Janet Jackson

467
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:14,500
You have a face that says, yes, yes

468
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:19,500
Matsumoto-san, tell us where your strike zone is

469
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:27,500
I have a face that says, yes, yes

470
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:30,500
I have a face that says, yes, yes

471
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:33,500
Do you have a face that says, yes, yes?

472
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,500
You're saying amazing things

473
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:41,500
Normally I wouldn't say that

474
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,500
I have a face that says, yes, yes

475
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,500
I have a face that says, yes, yes

476
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,500
Wait a minute

477
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:56,500
Let's look at the bottom

478
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,500
Do you have Yamada Hanako?

479
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,500
I don't have one

480
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:03,500
I don't have one either

481
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,500
Do you have Kisamoto?

482
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,500
I don't have Kisamoto

483
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,500
You don't have Kisamoto?

484
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,500
I don't have one

485
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:14,500
I don't have Kisamoto either

486
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,500
You can't do that

487
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:17,500
It's like that

488
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:18,500
It's like that?

489
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:21,500
When you say musical instrument, it's like a percussion instrument

490
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:24,500
I like musical instruments

491
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:27,500
Which one is a musical instrument?

492
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:33,500
Which one is the bottom?

493
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,500
Moriman

494
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,500
I don't have Moriman

495
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,500
I can't do Moriman

496
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,500
But I can do Taneumaman

497
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,500
I can't do it

498
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:53,500
I can't do Taneumaman

499
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:56,500
That's tough

500
00:22:56,500 --> 00:23:00,500
Because there's a pig, it looks like a horse

501
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:03,500
But it's this one

502
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:09,500
I know it's tough

503
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:15,500
But I think Taneumaman is better

504
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,500
Please

505
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,500
You don't know that, right?

506
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,500
At 4 or 5 in the morning

507
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,500
Who is it?

508
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,500
It's Taneumaman

509
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,500
I can't do it

510
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,500
I can't do it

511
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:36,500
I can't do it

512
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,500
I can't do it

513
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,500
I can't do it

514
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,500
I can't do it

515
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,500
I can't do it

516
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:48,500
I can't do it

517
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,500
Which one is a musical instrument?

518
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,500
I don't need a musical instrument

519
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,500
I can't do it

520
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,500
That one

521
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:10,500
I'm very depressed

522
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:16,500
It's like a new car has been wrecked
