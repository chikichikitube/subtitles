00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Last year, November.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
The Yomiuri Giants won the Japan Series.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
The biggest beer game was held in Japan.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
However, after the game ended, Endo came up with a proposal.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Why don't we do the beer game next year?

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
We will definitely win next year.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Everyone, please look forward to it.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The members made a sudden proposal.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
The following year, the Tigers won the beer game.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
At that time, I thought it was just Endo's selfishness.

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Our team won the game.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
It was my dream to drink beer with these guys.

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
It was my dream.

14
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
HANSHIN TIGERS!

15
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Congratulations on winning the Japan Series!

16
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
HANSHIN TIGERS!

17
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Get out of the way!

18
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I did it!

19
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
No!

20
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
No!

21
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Get out of the way!

22
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I told you not to get in there with a bottle!

23
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
We are here at Hanshin Tigers' ceremony.

24
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
As you can see, there is a lot of commotion.

25
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Let's hear what the players have to say.

26
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
No!

27
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
No!

28
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
No!

29
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
No!

30
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
No!

31
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
No!

32
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
No!

33
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
No!

34
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
No!

35
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
No!

36
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
No!

37
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
No!

38
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
No!

39
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
No!

40
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
No!

41
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
No!

42
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
No!

43
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
No!

44
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
No!

45
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
No!

46
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
No!

47
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:27,500
It's amazing.

48
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:40,000
Arthur!

49
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:46,500
Yeah!

50
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:51,500
Thank you very much!

51
00:04:51,500 --> 00:05:01,500
Thank you very much!

52
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:06,500
Thank you very much!

53
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,500
This is the best!

54
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:15,500
Thank you very much!

55
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:20,500
Thank you very much!

56
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:25,500
This is the best!

57
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:30,500
Thank you very much!

58
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:35,500
Thank you very much!

59
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:40,500
Thank you very much!

60
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:45,500
Thank you very much!

61
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:50,500
This is the best!

62
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:55,500
Thank you very much!

63
00:05:55,500 --> 00:06:00,500
Thank you very much!

64
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:05,500
Thank you very much!

65
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:10,500
Thank you very much!

66
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:16,500
Thank you very much!

67
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,500
Everyone!

68
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,500
Maybe!

69
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,500
The owner of the Daiei is

70
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:26,500
It may not be!

71
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:28,500
Everyone from now on

72
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:31,500
I changed my Daiei uniform

73
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,500
After 5 minutes!

74
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,500
5 minutes?

75
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,500
5 minutes is fast!

76
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:41,500
I was going to jump into the beer bin

77
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,500
Mr. Heipo!

78
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,500
What happened!

79
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,500
Mr. Heipo, be careful!

80
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,500
I jumped into the beer bin

81
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,500
I jump into the beer bin

82
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,500
There are no glasses!

83
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,500
I panicked by myself

84
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,500
I have nothing to say

85
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,500
I didn't get out of the way

86
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,500
I have nothing to say

87
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:01,500
I have no glasses!

88
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:09,500
From the sign to the beer, the preparation for the Daiei version was done in a hurry.

89
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:14,500
And 10 minutes later...

90
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:32,500
Fukuoka Daiei Hawks, the best in Japan, congratulations!

91
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:54,500
Fukuoka Daiei Hawks, the best in Japan, congratulations!

92
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:24,500
Fukuoka Daiei Hawks, the best in Japan, congratulations!

93
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:53,500
Fukuoka Daiei Hawks, the best in Japan, congratulations!

94
00:08:53,500 --> 00:09:18,500
Fukuoka Daiei Hawks, the best in Japan, congratulations!

95
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:39,500
Fukuoka Daiei Hawks, the best in Japan, congratulations!

96
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:56,500
Fukuoka Daiei Hawks, the best in Japan, congratulations!

97
00:09:56,500 --> 00:10:13,500
Fukuoka Daiei Hawks, the best in Japan, congratulations!

98
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:28,500
Fukuoka Daiei Hawks, the best in Japan, congratulations!

99
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:45,500
Fukuoka Daiei Hawks, the best in Japan, congratulations!

100
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:59,500
Thank you very much! Thank you very much!

101
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:16,500
Thank you very much!

102
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:44,500
Thank you very much! Thank you very much!

103
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:47,500
How many times have you done this this year?

104
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,500
About six times.

105
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:55,500
I don't know how many times, but everyone's movements are so good.

106
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:59,500
It's like you've been doing the same thing over and over again.

107
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,500
That's true.

108
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,500
That's true.

109
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:09,500
Thank you very much! Thank you very much!

110
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:12,500
Thank you very much!

111
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:16,500
In this way, the two beers are safely over.

112
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:26,500
A visitor to the relaxing room.

113
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:29,500
What did you just do to your chest?

114
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,500
I did both my upper and lower body.

115
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,500
Oh, both?

116
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:43,500
I went to the hotel in New York and went to the pool.

117
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,500
I thought it was just around here.

118
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,500
I think I found it.

119
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,500
You should tell the manager.

120
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,500
What?

121
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,500
You should tell the manager.

122
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,500
I'm waiting.

123
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,500
It's over.

124
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,500
It doesn't matter.

125
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:01,500
I'll have a beer tonight.

126
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,500
It's over.

127
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:08,500
I've been watching you play last year.

128
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:11,500
You played both Giants and Seibu.

129
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:15,500
And you were in our endo.

130
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,500
Our endo?

131
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,500
That's right.

132
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,500
This year, Hanshin was able to win the championship.

133
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:24,500
That was a coincidence.

134
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,500
It's not a coincidence.

135
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:33,500
It's a coincidence.

136
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:38,500
That's why the endo of 2003 is our Hiroshima Tohoku Cup.

137
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,500
Our?

138
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:45,500
I wanted to play with beer.

139
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:56,500
The endo was out of use.

140
00:13:56,500 --> 00:14:00,500
I was in it, too.

141
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,500
I was in it, too.

142
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,500
You weren't in it.

143
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,500
I was in it, too.

144
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:07,500
You were in it only once.

145
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:10,500
You were in it twice.

146
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:13,500
You were in it twice.

147
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:18,500
That's why I prepared it.

148
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,500
I'm waiting.

149
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:24,500
I've been drinking about two cups.

150
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:28,500
I'm done with the staff.

151
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:31,500
I'm sorry, but I'm going home.

152
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,500
Endo.

153
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,500
I'm going home.

154
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,500
Say it.

155
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,500
I'll pay you back.

156
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,500
You don't know?

157
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:43,500
You won Hanshin last year and won Hanshin this year.

158
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:49,500
The next thing you want to win is the cup.

159
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:52,500
You want to win the cup, don't you?

160
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,500
What are you talking about?

161
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,500
I'm number eight.

162
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:59,500
You're a permanent loser.

163
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:02,500
Endo is a permanent loser.

164
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,500
I'm number three.

165
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:07,500
I'm a permanent loser.

166
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:11,500
We're friends, so I'll leave it to you two.

167
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,500
I've brought everything you need.

168
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,500
Please help me.

169
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,500
I'm begging you.

170
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,500
I won't ask you again and again.

171
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:22,500
I did it on a show somewhere in Yamamoto.

172
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:27,500
There's no show I'm a permanent loser.

173
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:30,500
I won't do it.

174
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:33,500
I won't do it.

175
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:38,500
I won't do it.

176
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:41,500
I won't do it.

177
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:46,500
I won't do it.

178
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,500
It's starting to look like a cup, isn't it?

179
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,500
It's obviously not.

180
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:56,500
This is when Mr. Kinuzashi was still active, so it's a little old-fashioned.

181
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,500
But I'll do the cup.

182
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:02,500
I know.

183
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:14,500
I was in a hurry, so I only have Endo's cup.

184
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:19,500
I've been collecting a lot of things while running around.

185
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,500
I'm tired.

186
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:25,500
I'll do it.

187
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,500
I'll do it.

188
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:30,500
This is the original.

189
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,500
It hasn't changed at all.

190
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:33,500
It's changed today.

191
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,500
What's that?

192
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:37,500
It's red.

193
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,500
Isn't that Red Oshima?

194
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,500
Soccer?

195
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,500
But it's red.

196
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,500
It's transparent.

197
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:46,500
If you look at it from a distance, it looks like it's going to change.

198
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,500
No, it's Shizuoka.

199
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:52,500
It's Shizuoka.

200
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:55,500
I went to Shizuoka just now.

201
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:58,500
I got it from a player called Wada.

202
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:03,500
I got it from a player called Wada.

203
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,500
Excuse me.

204
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:12,500
I'm wearing a uniform right now.

205
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,500
Mr. Saki.

206
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:20,500
Mr. Saki.

207
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:26,500
Wow, it's cold.

208
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,500
It's cold.

209
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,500
It's like Christmas Saki.

210
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,500
I'll put it in.

211
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:35,500
I'll put it in.

212
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,500
I'll put it in.

213
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,500
I'll never lose it.

214
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,500
I'll never lose it.

215
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,500
Mr. Hamada.

216
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,500
Me?

217
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,500
Yes.

218
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,500
Mr. Hamada.

219
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:49,500
I came back from my partner.

220
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,500
What partner?

221
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,500
Kato.

222
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,500
Kato.

223
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:57,500
Kato.

224
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,500
This is bad.

225
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,500
This is hard.

226
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,500
Really?

227
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,500
This is hard.

228
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,500
Mr. Kato.

229
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:10,500
What is this?

230
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,500
I'm going to put on a red hat.

231
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,500
Mr. Baba?

232
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,500
Yes.

233
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,500
What did you just say?

234
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,500
Mr. Baba.

235
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,500
Mr. Baba.

236
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,500
Oh, my God.

237
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,500
It's bad.

238
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:26,500
You're using red panties.

239
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,500
It's like Pink Panther.

240
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,500
Wait.

241
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:33,500
That's enough.

242
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:37,500
What's up with him?

243
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,500
It's hard.

244
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,500
I don't know myself.

245
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,500
I'm sure you're still preparing.

246
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:32,200
He's wearing

247
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:49,500
The worst.

248
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:53,500
If you go from Chatan, you have to do it in a different way.

249
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,500
You have to do the same thing twice.

250
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,500
With Baba and Baba.

251
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:00,500
At least let Baba go first.

252
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,500
It's after Baba.

253
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,500
It's after Baba.

254
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,500
It's after Baba.

255
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:07,500
I did it.

256
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:10,500
It was a little too big.

257
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,500
It's a little too big.

258
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,500
Producer Tsutsuga.

259
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,500
Excuse me.

260
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,500
Ah, the fan's part.

261
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,500
Yes, properly.

262
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,500
After all, that's...

263
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,500
Producer.

264
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,500
That's right.

265
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:24,500
Producer.

266
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,500
Wow.

267
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,500
That's...

268
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,500
I don't like that.

269
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,500
I don't like that.

270
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:32,500
This person doesn't hesitate at all.

271
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,500
It's his own eyes.

272
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,500
It's his own eyes.

273
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:39,500
After this, Yamamoto asked the other staff to join the beer party.

274
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:45,500
He gave red things in turn for the uniform of the car.

275
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:57,500
If red wasn't enough, he took out red paint and applied it all over the staff's body.

276
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,500
There's a little more.

277
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,500
There's a little more.

278
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,500
Yes, yes.

279
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:05,500
What is this?

280
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,500
What is that?

281
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,500
Salmon?

282
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:08,500
It's salmon.

283
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,500
Is it salmon?

284
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,500
It's Santa.

285
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:14,500
Santa, don't bring it this time.

286
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,500
It's salty, Yamamoto.

287
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,500
Thank you.

288
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:44,500
Thank you.
