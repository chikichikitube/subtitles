1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Next time, at Gaki no Tsukai Arahen, Chikitsuki Jitsukyan Baachan Jutsu Chou Taikai!

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Good evening!

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
How are you all doing on your day off?

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
What?

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
How are you all doing today?

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
What are you talking about?

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Tonight, we're going to have some fun with our grandfathers and grandmothers.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Let's start with the Matsumoto team.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Good evening!

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
We're going to give you a quiz using gestures, right?

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
What do you think of these shoes?

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Aren't they easy to put on?

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
What kind of person are you?

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm from London.

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
How long have you been wearing these shoes?

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
About 100 years.

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Isn't it fun?

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
First, we have Komori's aunt.

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Please give her a round of applause!

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Recently, she's become the answer to a lot of our questions.

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Her name is Amamoto.

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Good evening!

24
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
How long have you been wearing these shoes?

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I've been wearing these shoes since I was young.

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,200
I don't

27
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,000
There used to be a button like this.

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I have moved half of it to the left....

29
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:44,000
We don't have to worry about this.

30
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:23,280
Next, welcome to chop

31
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
we have Namikoshi and Tokujiro.

32
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
And, the assistant is this person. Please welcome!

33
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
First, Hamada Team's Namikoshi-san, please come over here.

34
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Hamada Team's Namikoshi-san, please come over here.

35
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
What is it?

36
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Your teeth are so narrow!

37
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
What is it?

38
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Your teeth are so narrow!

39
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
What is it?

40
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Your teeth are so narrow!

41
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Your teeth are so narrow!

42
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
What is it?

43
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Your teeth are so narrow!

44
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
What is it?

45
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Please make a gesture to your ally.

46
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I guess I'll do that.

47
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I guess I'll do that.

48
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I guess I'll do that.

49
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I'll do that.

50
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
And, Matsumoto Team...

51
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Look!

52
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
The king's R3, D2.

53
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Oh, I got it! I got it!

54
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
What? Is it a T-ball?

55
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Can you see the Matsumoto team? This is the correct answer.

56
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
They're fighting, aren't they?

57
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Yes.

58
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Oh, pro-wrestling?

59
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Pro-wrestling?

60
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
They're going for a good fight! They're going for a good fight, Captain!

61
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
What's that?

62
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
They're going for a good fight for pro-wrestling?

63
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Yes!

64
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
They're going for a good fight!

65
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
They're going for a good fight, Captain!

66
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
What's that?

67
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
What's that?

68
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
They're going for a good fight!

69
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Oh!

70
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Sorry.

71
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
What are you doing?

72
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
What? I don't get it!

73
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
That was a shame.

74
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
The correct answer was Giant Baba.

75
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I did it like this.

76
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
What are you laughing at?

77
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Let's go to the Matsumoto team.

78
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Do you understand?

79
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Yes, I do.

80
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Yes, it looks like it's okay.

81
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
What's that?

82
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
What's that?

83
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I don't know.

84
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
What?

85
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I don't know.

86
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
What?

87
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Oh, I got it.

88
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Yes, Mr. Yamamoto.

89
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Madonna.

90
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
That's wonderful!

91
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Thank you.

92
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Here it is.

93
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Thank you.

94
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Ready, start!

95
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
It's quite detailed.

96
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Wow!

97
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Oh!

98
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
The Olympics.

99
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
What's that?

100
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
You can say whatever you want.

101
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I don't want to see it.

102
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I don't want to see it.

103
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
It looks like my face.

104
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
You're angry.

105
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Okay.

106
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Here you go.

107
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Synchro.

108
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
That's correct.

109
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
The correct answer was 100 points.

110
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
The correct answer was synchro dance.

111
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Now, the Matsumoto team.

112
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Here is the question.

113
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
What's that?

114
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Here it is.

115
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Oh!

116
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Demon.

117
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
That's correct.

118
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
That's strange.

119
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
There is no such thing.

120
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Please look at the front.

121
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
What do you say when you see a demon?

122
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I love you.

123
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Oh, thank you.

124
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Thank you.

125
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Please look at the front.

126
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I wonder if there is something I can think of.

127
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Here it is.

128
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I don't know the name of the machine.

129
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
It's a good thing.

130
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
What do you say?

131
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Z-Ghost?

132
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Correct.

133
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Wonderful.

134
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
That's correct.

135
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Thank you.

136
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Now, the captain.

137
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Here you go.

138
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Here it is.

139
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Ready, start!

140
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
That's easy.

141
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I have muscle pain.

142
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I have muscle pain.

143
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Ah!

144
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I don't know the name of the machine.

145
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
It's a devil.

146
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
That's correct.

147
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
That's correct.

148
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I don't know the name of the machine.

149
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I don't know the name of the machine.

150
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Now, the captain.

151
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Here you go.

152
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Yes.

153
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
That's correct.

154
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Ready, start!

155
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I don't know the name of the machine.

156
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I have muscle pain.

157
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I have muscle pain.

158
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
That's easy.

159
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
That's easy.

160
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
That's correct.

161
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
That's correct.

162
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
That's correct.

163
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
That's correct.

164
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I don't know the name of the machine.

165
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
That's correct.

166
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Yes.

167
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Takasaki Yamanosawa.

168
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
That's not it.

169
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
It's like this.

170
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
It's Ryutaro.

171
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Ryutaro?

172
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
That's right.

173
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Ladies and gentlemen.

174
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Hello.

175
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Hello, hello, hello.

176
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Well, you're dressed roughly again today.

177
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
The set has changed from today.

178
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Oh, it's beautiful.

179
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I don't know if it's good or bad.

180
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
The staff was complimenting each other.

181
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Oh, it's beautiful.

182
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Well, if it's beautiful, it's not a good thing.

183
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Now, when I look at it, it's beautiful, it's beautiful.

184
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Do you have any money left?

185
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I'm told that I don't have any money left.

186
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
You've been doing this program since late at night, haven't you?

187
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Yes.

188
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
At night, there was really no money.

189
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
That's right.

190
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Seriously.

191
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
There was really no money.

192
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Is there any money now?

193
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Apparently there's no money at all.

194
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Really?

195
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Yes.

196
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
There's no way you're going to do anything.

197
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
You've read that old man and old woman today, haven't you?

198
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I don't know anything about that kind of character.

199
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
For example, if you say TDS's bento, it's pretty amazing.

200
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Oh.

201
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
It's all green.

202
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
There's a lot of side dishes.

203
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
There's a lot of shrimp.

204
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
It looks like a rice ball here.

205
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
It's a rice ball.

206
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
It's me.

207
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Are you on a trip again?

208
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I'm not on a trip.

209
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Don't break the rice ball.

210
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:54,000
TDS is really persistent, but there's no shrimp.

211
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
The shrimp is like this.

212
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
It's like this.

213
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
But the shrimp isn't bad either.

214
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
What?

215
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
There's something under it.

216
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
It's like a cream croquette.

217
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
It's like this.

218
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
But it's bad.

219
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
TDS's bento is pretty good.

220
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Yesterday, there was sukiyaki.

221
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Sukiyaki.

222
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
In the morning.

223
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Sukiyaki in the morning.

224
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
There's a chawanmushi.

225
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
There's a chawanmushi.

226
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
There's a sukiyaki next to it.

227
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
It's a raw egg.

228
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
That's right.

229
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
It's a pooh.

230
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
It's a pooh.

231
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
There's about six onigiri in it.

232
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
It's in there.

233
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
What's that long brown thing?

234
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
It's like Tsukudani.

235
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
It's like Tsukudani.

236
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
What do you think?

237
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Did I go overboard?

238
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Why onigiri?

239
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Well, it's like that.

240
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I don't know why I'm like this tonight.

241
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:57,000
There are a lot of things about movement, like politics.

242
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I'll tell you everything.

243
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
What's going on with politics?

244
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
What's going on?

245
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
What do you mean by politics?

246
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,000
You used to say something about PKO.

247
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
What are you talking about now?

248
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
What kind of movement are you doing?

249
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Now it's PKO.

250
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Not yet?

251
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I've been listening to that all the time.

252
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I've been listening to that all the time.

253
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I don't want to be considered smart on TV.

254
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
To tell you the truth, I'm a pretty knowledgeable person.

255
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,000
For example, if you're familiar with politics, you're smart.

256
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,000
If you're familiar with anime, you're an idiot.

257
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
It's not like that at all.

258
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
It's the same.

259
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I don't think you're an idiot.

260
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I don't think you're an idiot.

261
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:53,000
If you're familiar with politics, you don't even know the name of Peter's mother.

262
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I don't know.

263
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
You knew that.

264
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
That's right.

265
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I think you're smart because you know everything.

266
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
What's your field?

267
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
What's my field?

268
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I'm being asked.

269
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I don't know.

270
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I don't know if this field is strong.

271
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
It's just a little bit.

272
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
What?

273
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Golf?

274
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I like golf, but that's all.

275
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:30,000
That's why I told you to say the name of a professional golfer to ten people.

276
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
That's it.

277
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I hate golf, but I can say it.

278
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Then say it.

279
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Say it.

280
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I can say it.

281
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Say it.

282
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Ozaki Naomichi.

283
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
There's something.

284
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Ozaki has three brothers.

285
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
So say it.

286
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Don't be a coward. There are three brothers. Don't be a coward. There are three brothers.

287
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Ozaki, Ozaki, Ozaki.

288
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
If you can't say it, you can say two more.

289
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
All of them are Ozaki.

290
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I don't know what Ozaki is.

291
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
That's enough.

292
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Wait a minute.

293
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I thought it was thirteen people.

294
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I thought it was thirteen people.

295
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
That's enough.

296
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I thought it was thirteen people.

297
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
You can't count Ozaki.

298
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I don't care if Ozaki is gone.

299
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I don't care if Ozaki is gone.

300
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
That's all.

301
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I'll just say it.

302
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I'll just say it.

303
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Toua-gyoku.

304
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I really like Toua-gyoku.

305
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Toua-gyoku.

306
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:42,000
And then, monkey.

307
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I'm a manga.

308
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I'm a pro golfer.

309
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I'm a manga.

310
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I'm a manga.

311
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I'm a manga.

312
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
That professional golfer monkey comes out.

313
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
What's his professional?

314
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I'm a professional.

315
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I'm a professional.

316
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
The sun is deep.

317
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I'll be in the sky tomorrow.

318
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I'll be in the sky tomorrow.

319
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I'm a little fat.

320
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Reiko.

321
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I'm a professional golfer Reiko.

322
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I'm a professional golfer.

323
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I'm a professional golfer Reiko.

324
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Why?

325
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Why is it a manga?

326
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I know a lot like this.

327
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
But if you say that, there are a lot of things that you can't say.

328
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
That's right.

329
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
That's right.

330
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
That's right.

331
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,000
So, when I'm on a quiz show, I always do a joke, but when I say the truth, it's amazing.

332
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:56,000
While I was shooting the comedy, I was doing a 6th grade drift.

333
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I did it.

334
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I did it.

335
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I did it.

336
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I got 80 points for a 6th grade drift in the national language.

337
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I got 80 points for a 6th grade drift in the national language, so I can do a quiz.

338
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
You can't do a drift in elementary school, can you?

339
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
If you can do it, show me the answer of your kanji.

340
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I'll leave it all.

341
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
What do you mean?

342
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I'm already answering.

343
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I'm already answering.

344
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I'm already answering.

345
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I'm already answering.

346
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I'm already answering.

347
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I'm already answering.

348
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I'm already answering.

349
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Who are you?

350
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I'm the manager of Nishimoto Cooperative.

351
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
This is an announcement...

352
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
What club is it?

353
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
You tell me!

354
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Isn't it an announcement?

355
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
It's a batman club run by young people in Nishimoto Co.

356
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
So who are you?

357
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Who are you?

358
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I'm Nishibori from Yoshimoto Kogyo

359
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I'm his manager

360
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
How much do you weigh now?

361
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
It doesn't matter

362
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
If you're going to make an announcement, let go of your weight

363
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I'm not going to let go of my weight

364
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:35,000
This is the Asahi Super Dry Hall

365
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
My body is so small

366
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Team Zero is going to be on the stage

367
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
This is the guest, Jimmy Onishi, Shinodaki Michi

368
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
It's funny

369
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
The audience is going to love it

370
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
It's a twin

371
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
If it was just one person, it would be a pig

372
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
It's a twin, so it's this

373
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
If it was just one person, it would be amazing

374
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Thank you

375
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,000
The other day, I got a signature from Hikaru Ippei

376
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:20,000
When I went home and looked at it, it didn't say Hikaru Ippei

377
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Is the signature written properly?

378
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Please write it

379
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I'll think about the signature

380
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Where are you going to write it?

381
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
It's down there

382
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Really?

383
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I prepared it

384
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I'll tell you to give me a signature

385
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
But are you happy to have that?

386
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I want to get a signature, but I can't

387
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
No one has ever had it

388
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I can't do anything

389
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
What is this?

390
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
You can use your signature

391
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I'm going to use my whole brain

392
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
I'm going to use my brain

393
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I'm going to write it and put it on the pad

394
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I can't laugh

395
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
I'm not going to do that

396
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
When should I write it?

397
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I think it's better to write it after showing it

398
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I wanted to write it now

399
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
I'm going to write it

400
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I'm going to write it

401
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
My signature is like this

402
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Write it

403
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I'm going to write it

404
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I'm going to write it

405
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
It's new

406
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
What is your signature?

407
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
My signature is like this

408
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
What is this?

409
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Do you understand?

410
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
What is this?

411
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Please explain

412
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
My signature is like this

413
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Why?

414
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
It's like this

415
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
It's like this

416
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Where should I write it?

417
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
On the back

418
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Like this

419
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I'm going to write it like this

420
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
This is a hammer

421
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Why?

422
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
It's like this

423
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
It's like this

424
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
This is a hammer

425
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Even if you tell me to do it

426
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
It's a hammer

427
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
It's a hammer

428
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
You guys

429
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
I don't know

430
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I don't know

431
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
It's a hammer

432
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
What?

433
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
It's like this

434
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
It's a hammer

435
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I'm writing the year

436
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I'm writing the year

437
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I'm writing the year

438
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
What is this?

439
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
It's a hammer

440
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
It's a hammer

441
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
I can't do it at all

442
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
In my case

443
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
It's perfect

444
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
This is Matsumoto's signature

445
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
For example, I think this is the easiest way to understand

446
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
When you do this

447
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
I don't like it

448
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
When you do this

449
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
This is Matsumoto's year

450
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
This is my signature

451
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Look

452
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Where are you writing the year?

453
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
I can understand this

454
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I can understand this

455
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
You can understand this

456
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
What is this?

457
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,540
It's a

458
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:55,540
It's a year

459
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:57,540
It's a year

460
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:59,540
It's a year

461
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:01,540
What is this?

462
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:03,540
It's a hammer

463
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:05,540
It's a hammer

464
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:07,540
This is gone

465
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:09,540
What?

466
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:11,540
What is this?

467
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:13,540
When I wrote the year

468
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:15,540
I got an OK sign

469
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:19,540
You can't do it

470
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:21,540
I wrote everything

471
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:23,540
I can't do it

472
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:25,540
I can't do it

473
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:27,540
Write everything

474
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:29,540
Matsumoto's year

475
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:31,540
I can understand

476
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:35,540
What is this?

477
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:37,540
Where is the hammer?

478
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:39,540
The hammer is here

479
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:41,540
It's here

480
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:47,540
Even if I say this

481
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:49,540
I think I got an OK

482
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:51,540
You got an OK

483
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:53,540
I got an OK

484
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:55,540
You got an OK

485
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:57,540
You got an OK

486
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:59,540
I wrote everything

487
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:01,540
I wrote everything

488
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:23,540
Thank you for watching
