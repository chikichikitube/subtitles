1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The day before the accident

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
The day before the accident

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
The day before the accident

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
If it's 10, it's not good

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
If it's 10, it's not good

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I think it's about 20

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
It's not good

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
This is about one

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Two

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Let's go one more

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
If you die of the accident

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
You will retire

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
If it's like this

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
If it got trapped

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Like these

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Then it can't survive

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
This is the reason

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Is it?

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
It's OK.

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
If it's too much, it'll be fine.

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'll do it like this.

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Will it come off?

23
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
No, it's OK.

24
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Can you do it with one piece of rice?

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Is the amount of gunpowder the same as the one you boiled yesterday?

26
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
It's OK.

27
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Not the exact amount.

28
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Just do it as you said.

29
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
It's OK if you get hurt a little.

30
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
But if you don't be careful, it's dangerous.

31
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I'm counting on you.

32
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:48,000
It's better if you say it quickly.

33
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Let's go.

34
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Open it.

35
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Let's meet again.

36
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
It's OK.

37
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
It's OK.

38
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Let's close the lid.

39
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
There's no water.

40
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Pull it.

41
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Are you OK?

42
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
It's OK.

43
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
You have to close it.

44
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I'll close it again.

45
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
You have to close it, too.

46
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
What are you doing?

47
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
It's OK.

48
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Are you OK?

49
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
It's OK.

50
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
You can do it, right?

51
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Are you OK?

52
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
It's OK.

53
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Let's go.

54
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Are you OK?

55
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Yes.

56
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Are you ready?

57
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Yes.

58
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Are you OK?

59
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Yes.

60
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Let's go.

61
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Are you OK?

62
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Yes.

63
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Are you ready?

64
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Start.

65
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
That was...

66
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
That was...

67
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I felt bad.

68
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I'm in trouble.

69
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Don't do that.

70
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Look at me.

71
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
It's about you.

72
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I'll look at you.

73
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Don't do that.

74
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Hey!

75
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
There was a lot of gunpowder.

76
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I'll go.

77
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Are you OK?

78
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Is this the place?

79
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
That sound is not funny.

80
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:13,000
It's not here.

81
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Where is it?

82
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
There it is.

83
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Are you OK?

84
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Hey!

85
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Are you OK?

86
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
It was a success.

87
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I'm glad.

88
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
It was a success.

89
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I'm moved.

90
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,000
You can stop now.

91
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:09,000
What are you looking at?

92
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Do you have any ideas?

93
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
What are you going to do?

94
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
It's simple.

95
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I'm going to do it once a day.

96
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I don't think that's going to come out of your mouth.

97
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
You have to say thank you and good morning.

98
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
You!

99
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
You've never said thank you properly.

100
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
You!

101
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Don't stab my neck.

102
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,000
You say it.

103
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Do you have a college entrance exam this year?

104
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
What are you talking about?

105
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Are you serious?

106
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Are you serious?

107
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Do you want to pass?

108
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I'll pass.

109
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I can't.

110
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:00,000
People who watch TV think I'm crazy.

111
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I think so too.

112
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I'm a normal person.

113
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I have to teach them that I'm a normal person.

114
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I'll do it when I have to.

115
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
It's different from normal to school.

116
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
If you have common sense...

117
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
What do you mean by common sense?

118
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
If you have common sense, you can show your face.

119
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:28,000
If you don't have common sense, you can't say thank you properly.

120
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I never say that.

121
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
You never say that.

122
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I never say that.

123
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
You always say that when you enter the scene.

124
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
What?

125
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
You always say that.

126
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I never say that.

127
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Hey, get the staff together.

128
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I never say that.

129
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
With the glasses on.

130
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I don't need glasses.

131
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I don't say that when I greet.

132
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I'll do it with this tone.

133
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
You don't say that.

134
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:04,000
You don't say that?

135
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I always say that.

136
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
When people are talking in the dressing room, you'll come in and say,

137
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I don't know.

138
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Seriously.

139
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I always say that.

140
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
You don't say that.

141
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Why don't you try it when you come home in the morning?

142
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Good morning.

143
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Shut up!

144
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
What are you doing?

145
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
What is this?

146
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Have you ever properly greeted me like this?

147
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
You are the one who doesn't greet.

148
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Don't say such stupid things.

149
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
You can't say thank you at all.

150
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I said thank you!

151
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
You can't say thank you at all.

152
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Thank you.

153
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
What are you saying?

154
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
What are you doing?

155
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I'm not in the mood.

156
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I said thank you.

157
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
You can't say that.

158
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I said it, you idiot.

159
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
You!

160
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
You said you would bring me a cup of tea.

161
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
You are making a face like it's nothing.

162
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
It's true.

163
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
It's true.

164
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
You can't do it.

165
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Let me say it.

166
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Thank you.

167
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
You can't say that.

168
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
You can't say such stupid things.

169
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
You can't say such stupid things.

170
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I said it.

171
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I said thank you to him.

172
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I said thank you to him.

173
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I always say thank you.

174
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
You are making a face.

175
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I always say thank you to him.

176
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
You can't say that.

177
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
You can't say that.

178
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
What are you doing?

179
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I'm sorry.

180
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
It's true.

181
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
You should have said it.

182
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
You should have said it.

183
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
It's true.

184
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
You go to many places and work.

185
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,000
From now on, both of you should be polite.

186
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Let's do that.

187
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I will do as usual.

188
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
You don't say hello to me.

189
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Why should I say hello to you?

190
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I don't know.

191
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I don't say anything.

192
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
You don't say hello to me.

193
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I do.

194
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
You don't say hello to me.

195
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I do.

196
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
You don't say hello to me.

197
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Good morning, Hama-chan.

198
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Say it.

199
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Hey, get the staff together.

200
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I don't know anything about you.

201
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I can't hear you saying good morning, Hama-chan.

202
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I'm a little shy.

203
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
But I can't say it.

204
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
You should say it out loud.

205
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I don't understand.

206
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I can't communicate with you.

207
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Even if you do it behind my back.

208
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Please.

209
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I won't say it.

210
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I won't say it.

211
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
If you don't say it, I'll fine you.

212
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
OK.

213
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
How much do you want?

214
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
How much do you want?

215
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
10,000 yen.

216
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
What?

217
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
OK.

218
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
10,000 yen for one time.

219
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Really?

220
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Really.

221
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Are you serious?

222
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Yes.

223
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I'll earn a lot of money.

224
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
But you can't take that money.

225
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
What?

226
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Where are you going with that money?

227
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I won't give it to you.

228
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I'll save it for when I do something on this show.

229
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
My money will support this show?

230
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
You'll be surprised if I say I'll support it.

231
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
That's not true.

232
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I said it on this show.

233
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
What?

234
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
If I do it properly, I won't be angry.

235
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Why are you saying that?

236
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
What are you talking about?

237
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
What are you talking about?

238
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
If I do it properly, I won't be angry.

239
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
What?

240
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
If I do it properly, I won't be angry.

241
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
You should do the same.

242
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
What?

243
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
What?

244
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Don't hit my head.

245
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
If you hit my head, I'll give you 500,000 yen.

246
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I'm really worried about you.

247
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
When I went to the zoo with my dad,

248
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
when I went to Awaji Island with my family,

249
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,000
when I took my mom to the park,

250
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I can't remember any of them.

251
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
What are you talking about?

252
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Say it quickly.

253
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
What did I say at the beginning?

254
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I remember something, but I don't remember it anymore.

255
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I can't remember anything.

256
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
You're crazy.

257
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
So please stop it.

258
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
You can't do it.

259
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
You can't do it.

260
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
You can't do it.

261
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I'm just saying it.

262
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
You're right.

263
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I'm just saying it.

264
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
It's okay.

265
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
You know what?

266
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Kids cry.

267
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
What?

268
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Are you talking about that?

269
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
No, no, no.

270
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I'm talking about you.

271
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I haven't hit you yet.

272
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Really? Why?

273
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I haven't hit you yet.

274
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Did you start talking?

275
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
It's funny that you said it hurts when I hit you.

276
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I don't think so.

277
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
It's a little sad that my child speaks standard Japanese.

278
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
That's right.

279
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Children speak Osaka dialect.

280
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
That's right.

281
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Right?

282
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
If I say that my child doesn't know,

283
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
it's not very cute, right?

284
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
If I say I don't know,

285
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
he'll hug me like this.

286
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Child.

287
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
It's not that bad.

288
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I don't know.

289
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Well, standard Japanese is a little hard.

290
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
It's hard, right?

291
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
That's why I think you're a little lonely.

292
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Your Osaka dialect is especially dirty, right?

293
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
It's sticky.

294
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I still speak Osaka dialect that is close to standard Japanese.

295
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Are you stupid?

296
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
That's not true. I often get angry, right?

297
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Yes.

298
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
That's why when I speak in a normal way,

299
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
it's normal.

300
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
It's the same.

301
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Your dialect and my dialect.

302
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
No, it's totally different.

303
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
It's not different.

304
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
It's totally different.

305
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
It's the same.

306
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
It's totally different.

307
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
It's not different.

308
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I'm telling you it's different.

309
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
This is the strange thing.

310
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
It's different as a receiver.

311
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Who says that?

312
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Everyone says that.

313
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I don't say that. It's the same.

314
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
It's totally the same.

315
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Try to get angry.

316
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Idiot!

317
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I'll tear you apart!

318
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I won't say that.

319
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I'll say, hey!

320
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I'll say, hey!

321
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Hey!

322
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Hey!

323
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
It's different!

324
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
It's different!

325
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Hey!

326
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Hey!

327
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
You say, hey!

328
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
You say, hey!

329
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I'll tear you apart!

330
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I just wanted to say that.

331
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I'm serious.

332
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Why?

333
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I don't want my family to be like that.

334
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:30,000
But I don't want it to be between Osaka dialect and Hyojin dialect.

335
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
It happens sometimes.

336
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
It happens.

337
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
People say sa recently.

338
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I'm not aware of that.

339
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I didn't like this sa when I came to Tokyo.

340
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
These guys say sa, sa, sa, sa.

341
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Hey, I'm sa.

342
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I'm tired.

343
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
When you're tired, you don't say sa.

344
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,000
When you're tired, you say, I'm tired.

345
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I don't hear that often.

346
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,000
That's why I say sa recently.

347
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I don't really feel that sa.

348
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Why?

349
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I don't really hear that sa, sa, sa, sa.

350
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
That's why I say sa.

351
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Your reaction just now...

352
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I was going to go next, but I stopped for a second.

353
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I've never heard you say sa, sa, sa, sa.

354
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I'm the one who's letting you go.

355
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I've never heard you say sa, sa, sa, sa.

356
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I'm the one who's letting you go.

357
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I'm the one who's letting you go.

358
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I'm surprised.

359
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I should go.

360
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
You shouldn't change.

361
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
You're talking in Hyojin dialect because you feel bad.

362
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I can use it.

363
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Why?

364
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I can't say it at all.

365
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I can use it.

366
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I can use it.

367
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I'm from Tokyo.

368
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
You're from Thailand.

369
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
What?

370
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Hyojin dialect.

371
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Oh, really?

372
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
This is good.

373
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
No.

374
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
What?

375
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
No.

376
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
This is a good suit.

377
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Yeah.

378
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Your hair is natural.

379
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Yeah.

380
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
It's cool.

381
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
It's cool.

382
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Yeah.

383
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
What do you think?

384
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Speak!

385
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I can't speak.

386
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Speak!

387
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
No, but what?

388
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
What?

389
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
What?

390
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
So what?

391
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I think all living things are useful in their own way.

392
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
For example, a cicada eats dirt and cleanses it.

393
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
A sparrow eats a cockroach.

394
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
But what I don't understand is a beetle.

395
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Why would a beetle wear such a hard shell?

396
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
This is it.

397
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
A beetle.

398
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
A beetle.

399
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:08,000
But I think that a beetle is born to suppress a beetle.

400
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
What do you mean by suppress?

401
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
If a beetle doesn't break, it becomes a beetle's world.

402
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
That's fine.

403
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
It doesn't break, it becomes a world.

404
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
You!

405
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Is it okay for you to become a beetle's world?

406
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
It doesn't matter.

407
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
A beetle is making me sick.

408
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
It doesn't matter.

409
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,000
When I went to the dressing room, it was written that you are a beetle.

410
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I'm alone.

411
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,000
If there are a few regular people in the program, a beetle will definitely be in it.

412
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
If the beetle is late, the beetle is waiting.

413
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I don't know what to do.

414
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I don't have time.

415
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I'm sorry.

416
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
The beetle is waiting.

417
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
If the beetle is late, the beetle will come.

418
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I'm sorry.

419
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Let's go.

420
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
If you have something to complain about, say it.

421
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
It's hard.

422
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
It's you.

423
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Shinjuku is a world of beetles.

424
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
There is also a beetle yakuza.

425
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,000
If that's the case, I don't wear sleeves.

426
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I don't wear sleeves.

427
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
If it's a beetle, I don't wear sleeves.

428
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Do you know that?

429
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Of course.

430
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
It's hard.

431
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
It's a bear's hand.

432
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
It's a bear's hand.

433
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
It's a bear's hand.

434
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Of course.

435
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
It's hard.

436
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
If it's a beetle, it's a big deal.

437
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
I don't wear sleeves.

438
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
If that's the case, I don't wear sleeves.

439
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
That's why the beetle is holding me down.

440
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Thanks to the beetle, we...

441
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
You noticed it.

442
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Did you talk?

443
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I see.

444
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
I have a question for you.

445
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Why do heroes like the Kiranger have their nipples?

446
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
The Kiranger.

447
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Leave it to the Kiranger.

448
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I love curry rice.

449
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
The Kiranger is joking.

450
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
It's really funny.

451
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Why?

452
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
It has a face of a locomotive.

453
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
It has a face of a locomotive.

454
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
No matter how you look at it, it's just a leotard.

455
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
It comes out.

456
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
The Kiranger has a big heart.

457
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
It's a one-shot.

458
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
I really laughed.

459
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
It can't be defeated.

460
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
The Red Ranger can't be defeated.

461
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
It has a really strong mask.

462
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
The Red Ranger goes like this.

463
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
The Red Ranger trains a lot.

464
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
I want to win somehow.

465
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Until I meet it.

466
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Commander Edgar.

467
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,000
The old man who has a lot of Gorangers.

468
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:07,000
He tells the old man to drop a rock.

469
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
And then he goes like this.

470
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
He trains a lot.

471
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
He's good.

472
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
He tries again.

473
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
He loses again.

474
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
There's no time.

475
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
It's almost over.

476
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
It's not over.

477
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
What will happen?

478
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Commander Edgar says,

479
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
This is the only thing I have.

480
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
He opens it horizontally.

481
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
The Goranger.

482
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
He opens it quickly.

483
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
And he gives it a memory.

484
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
It doubles the power.

485
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
It has a memory from 1 to 5.

486
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Until now, it was 2.

487
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Now it's 5.

488
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
And then?

489
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
And then?

490
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
What happened to the rock?

491
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
The old man dropped it on purpose.

492
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I was surprised.

493
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
It's a Kamen Rider Musasabi.

494
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
It has wings.

495
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
It's Musasabi.

496
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
It flies like this.

497
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
It flies like this.

498
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
And it says,

499
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Kamen Rider, let's meet again.

500
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:35,000
It has a crown.
