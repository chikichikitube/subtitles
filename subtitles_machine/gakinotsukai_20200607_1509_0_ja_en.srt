1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Question! What is the first place of the Cup RR?

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Mecha-tsu-tsu Genki!

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Tonight is the remote Ogiri corner!

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
In the last week's show, the nine members were aiming to clear the course.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
What is the fourth member?

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Yosuki!

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Sakai Masaaki!

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
The first place is...

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Kai!

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
He successfully cleared the stage!

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Tanaka Hiko!

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
What is the fourth place's final score?

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
It's a piece of crap.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
What?

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Stop it!

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
What's with this regular season?

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
The regular members are still in the lead.

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
They have cleared the stage for 9 consecutive years!

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Will they be able to achieve their goal tonight?

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The rules have been revised

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Each person will announce the answer to the question

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Matsumoto will decide if it's interesting or not

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
With 9 people clearing the game, everyone will be able to get 10,000 yen each

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Please make it easy.

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
It's easy.

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
It's easy to cut.

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
It was really easy.

28
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Please make it easier.

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Please lower it.

30
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
What is this?

31
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Let's go to the next topic.

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
What is the special skill used by American ninja?

33
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Please write it down.

34
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
It's difficult.

35
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I think so too.

36
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
It's difficult among the topics so far.

37
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,600
I thought that was better than I expected.

38
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:56,900
I think I underestimated the performance of this.

39
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:59,800
I have to go to a higher level.

40
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:04,300
But Matsumoto-san, after this topic came out, everyone's movements stopped.

41
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:11,500
That's because the pieces that have really increased the rotation rate seem to have stopped.

42
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,700
Oh, that's the phenomenon.

43
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,700
It's completely stopped.

44
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:23,700
I want the top to be in the back of the head.

45
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:28,700
What is the special move used by the American Ninja?

46
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:30,700
German suplex shuriken.

47
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:38,700
It's good as a top.

48
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:39,700
Let's go to the prize.

49
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:42,700
The ultimate skill used by American Ninja is?

50
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:44,700
Ninja Art, Pistol

51
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:49,700
That's good

52
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:50,700
You can do it

53
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:51,700
You can do it

54
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:52,700
Ok, Okada

55
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:56,700
The ultimate skill used by American Ninja is?

56
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,700
Chihuahua's Neck Punch

57
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:06,700
He got it

58
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:07,700
Amazing

59
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:08,700
He got it

60
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:09,700
Otake, go!

61
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:10,200
Yes!

62
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,700
The special move used by the American Ninja is...

63
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:14,200
Go!

64
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,200
Cherry Pie Attack!

65
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,700
Yoshio, go! Yoshio, go!

66
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:25,200
The special move used by the American Ninja is...

67
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:26,700
Missile!

68
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,700
It's the same move! It's the same move!

69
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,200
Alright, Tsunai, go! Tsunai, go!

70
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:41,200
The special move used by the American Ninja is...

71
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,200
Machi-Bi-Su!

72
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,200
Machi-Bi-Su!

73
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,200
Push it, push it!

74
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,200
Machi-Bi-Su!

75
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,200
Go, go, go!

76
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,200
Machi-Bi-Su!

77
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,200
Machi-Bi-Su!

78
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,200
What the hell is this?

79
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,200
What the hell is this?

80
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,200
It was close!

81
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,200
It was close!

82
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,200
It was close!

83
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,200
The order might be wrong.

84
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:13,200
If we ask the regular people, maybe...

85
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,200
Do you want to ask?

86
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,200
Let's do it!

87
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:19,200
What is the special skill of the American Ninja?

88
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,200
Drop kick!

89
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:29,200
Yama-chan, what is the special move of the American Ninja?

90
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:34,200
American Popcorn!

91
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:41,200
What? Really?

92
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:47,200
Who said the special move of the American Ninja?

93
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:51,280
leaveação Massachusetts

94
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,040
Oh!

95
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:56,660
Everyone got it!

96
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:58,240
wait!

97
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:58,740
You got it wrong!

98
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:00,340
Wait, Let me answer!

99
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:01,200
It was oboroi!

100
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,540
The real answer is wanting to see!

101
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:03,100
Let you watch rebound!

102
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:03,940
We must be funny!

103
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:05,500
We are funny.

104
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,080
He is American.

105
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,340
Let us watch it!

106
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:11,660
Don't just listen to him!

107
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:12,700
It's not funny.

108
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:13,960
Ma-kii bisa posit?

109
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:15,420
Sorry.

110
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:16,420
Ma-kii ambos.

111
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:16,980
Ma-kii discard?

112
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:18,980
This is not funny!

113
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:20,980
What are you doing?

114
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:22,980
What are you doing?

115
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:24,980
Can you do it with 10 people?

116
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:26,980
Let's work together

117
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:28,980
Let's do our best

118
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:30,980
What are you doing?

119
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:32,980
I will rest Tanaka and Yamazaki

120
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:34,980
Wait a minute

121
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:36,980
Wait a minute

122
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:38,980
You want to rest?

123
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:40,980
I don't want to rest in the remote

124
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:42,980
Even Tanaka is remote

125
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:44,980
You don't want to rest

126
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:46,980
Sorry, I don't have a night off.

127
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:49,980
Sorry, but I'll go with sweet and sour.

128
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:50,980
Okay!

129
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:52,980
Let's do it all!

130
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:55,980
Sweet and sour is a problem.

131
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,980
Question!

132
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:02,980
What is the name of the strawberry sweeter than the sweet king?

133
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:04,980
Please answer!

134
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:06,980
Sweet from the first question.

135
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:07,980
This is good.

136
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:08,980
Sweet and sour.

137
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:12,980
Even elementary school students are happy to think about it.

138
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:14,980
I can do it in kindergarten.

139
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:15,980
You can do it in kindergarten?

140
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:18,980
I'm confident that I can continue.

141
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:22,980
But I think it's dangerous if I don't clean up my regular.

142
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:26,980
It's okay.

143
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:28,980
It's just strict.

144
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:30,980
It's a regular.

145
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:33,980
Look at that.

146
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:37,980
Seriously, it's stopped.

147
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:40,980
It's frozen.

148
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:41,980
I'm surprised.

149
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:44,980
Wow, I'm surprised.

150
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:47,980
Who wants to go first?

151
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:49,980
I'll go first.

152
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:50,980
I'll go.

153
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:56,980
Shouji, what is the best sweet strawberry flavor?

154
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:57,980
Sweet soy sauce.

155
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:02,980
Wrong!

156
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:04,980
It's not sweet.

157
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:06,980
Next question.

158
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:07,980
It's sweet.

159
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:08,980
It's hard.

160
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:10,980
Isn't it really tough?

161
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:12,980
Next topic...

162
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:13,980
Wait, wait, wait

163
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:14,980
Let's go with this

164
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:16,980
Okay, here's the topic

165
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:20,980
What do Indians do when they catch a cold?

166
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:22,980
Please write your answers

167
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:24,980
The difference in culture

168
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:25,980
I see

169
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:26,980
How to make it funny

170
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:27,980
I see, I see

171
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:29,980
How to make it taste good

172
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:31,980
Who should go next?

173
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:33,980
They can decide

174
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:34,980
I see

175
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:36,980
I'll go first

176
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:37,980
Really?

177
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:41,480
It's a very bad one, so I'll give you a score.

178
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,480
You can't say it's a bad one.

179
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,480
Okada, let's start.

180
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:49,480
What do you do when an Indian gets a cold?

181
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:53,480
I press the red button on his forehead.

182
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,480
Good!

183
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,480
That's how it is.

184
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,480
Okada, who did you choose?

185
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,480
Someone who looks like he can do it.

186
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,480
Then, please choose Shoji.

187
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,480
Shoji.

188
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:10,480
Let's go. What do you do when an Indian gets a cold?

189
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,480
Go into a curry room.

190
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,480

It's a song by a hip hopper

297
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,480
It's a hip hop song

298
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,480
It's like a greeting

299
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,480
Gyaaa!

300
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,480

That's harsh, isn't it?

304
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,480
What do you think, Mr. Hamada?

305

You can't do this.

Okay, then.

310
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:17,480

00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,480
Will you show your kindness?

380
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,480
Will you show your kindness?

381
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,480
Please shout it again!

382
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,480
ORIGOTTO!

383
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,480
Eh?

384
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,480
Please! Please!

385
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,480
Please!

386
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,480
Please!

387
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,480
Please!

388
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,480
How is it?

389
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,480
Good!

390
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,480
It's good!

391
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,480
It's dangerous!

392
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,480
Where is dangerous?

393
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,480
It's dangerous!

394
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,480
Who will Shouzo point at?

395
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,480
Then...

396
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,480
Hose!

397
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,480
Let's go, Yama-chan!

398
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:58,480
What is the meaning of Arigato in Miyatori dialect?

399
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,480
Please

400
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,480
Arigato

401
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,480
He spoke

402
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,480
He spoke

403
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,480
He did it

404
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,480
Good

405
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,480
Good

406
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,480
That was good, wasn't it?

407
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,480
It was good

408
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,480
Good

409
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:23,480
Next, if he succeeds, he will be the director of the prize

410
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,480
Attacker...

411
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:58,980
Attacker...

412
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:01,980
Attacker...

413
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,480
Let's press it!

414
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,480
Attackers from far away...

415
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:08,980
That's Yokoz!

416
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:11,980
Thank you! What's that?

417
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:13,980
Attackers from far away...

418
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:15,980
Attackers from far away...

419
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:18,980
Three white clouds...

420
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:20,980
Attackers...

421
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:22,980
I can see it!

422
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:24,980
He's back!

423
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:28,980
He came yesterday, but he's back today?

424
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,980
Yay!

425
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:32,980
Yay!

426
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:36,980
The gold medal!

427
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:38,980
Yay!

428
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:40,980
That was close!

429
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:42,980
That was close!

430
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:44,980
We finally got it!

431
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:47,980
I think we all got it.

432
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:49,980
Right?

433
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:52,980
I didn't think of Endo like that.

434
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:56,980
I didn't think of you like that.

435
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:02,980
Next question.

436
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:07,980
What is the 13th picture?

437
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,980
Please write it down.

438
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:15,980
I think it's very difficult.

439
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:18,980
But it's difficult to guess.

440
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:23,980
Everyone, this is the last question for the time being.

441
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:25,980
The last one?

442
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:28,980
Shouzo, do you know the 12 poems?

443
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:30,980
I'm asking if you know them.

444
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:31,980
That's true.

445
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:35,980
Shouzo, please say the 12 poems.

446
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:39,980
Ne, Ushi, Tora, U, Tatsu, Mi, Bi, Bi.

447
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:40,980
Bi?

448
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:41,980
What's Bi?

449
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:43,980
Alphabet?

450
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:48,980
It's funny that you answered that.

451
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:57,980
It's a new one.

452
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:01,980
But this time, the goal is to get a BZ chance.

453
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:05,980
It's the last one.

454
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:06,980
Let's go.

455
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:07,980
Okada, are you ready?

456
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:08,980
I'm already stuck.

457
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:11,980
What is the 13th picture?

458
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:12,980
What is it?

459
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:14,980
One more time!

460
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:17,980
Wait a minute

461
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:19,980
Oh, I think I know

462
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:20,980
You know it, right?

463
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:21,980
I think I know

464
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:23,980
Who will you point at?

465
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:25,980
Please point at Suwa-san

466
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:26,980
Suwa

467
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:30,980
What is the 13th picture?

468
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:32,980
Benz

469
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:35,980
Good, good, good

470
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:36,980
I like it

471
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:37,980
Suwa-san

472
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:39,980
Suwa, who will you point at?

473
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:41,980
No, he's not trapped by animals.

474
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:42,980
I see.

475
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:43,980
Kojima-kun!

476
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:44,980
Uwa!

477
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:45,980
He said, Uwa!

478
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:49,980
What is the 13th picture?

479
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:51,980
Okapi.

480
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:57,980
There are many kinds of animals.

481
00:20:57,980 --> 00:20:58,980
Otake.

482
00:20:58,980 --> 00:20:59,980
Otake!

483
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:02,980
What is the 13th picture?

484
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:04,980
Riki Choshu.

485
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:06,980
2

486
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:10,980
It's good, the Pokemon is not wearing at all

487
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:12,980
It's coming in pieces, it's good

488
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,980
Shoji-san

489
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:15,980
Let's go

490
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:18,980
What is the 13th picture?

491
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:20,980
The Chief

492
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:23,980
It's good

493
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:26,980
It's good, it's not wearing at all

494
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:27,980
It's good

495
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:29,980
Then, Zagoshi-san

496
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:33,980
Zagoshi, what is the 13th picture?

497
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:36,980
Mic exercise

498
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:43,980
That's good

499
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:46,980
It's about time. Zagoshi, who will you show?

500
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:48,980
Mr. Hosei

501
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:49,980
Ok, I understand

502
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:52,980
What is the 13th picture?

503
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:24,980
What is it?

504
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:26,980
An employee?

505
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:30,980
That's good

506
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:32,980
He's very hardworking

507
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:34,980
But he's working hard

508
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:35,980
I see

509
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:37,980
He's working hard

510
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:39,980
But he's not working

511
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:41,980
Okay, okay

512
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:43,980
Good

513
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:45,980
Good

514
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:47,980
Good

515
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:49,980
You've won the prize

516
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:51,980
You'll take 20,000 yen

517
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:53,980
Let's take it home.

518
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:55,980
Endo-san!

519
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:59,980
Endo-kun, what is the third picture?

520
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:01,980
Yes!

521
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:03,980
It's here!

522
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:05,980
G.T.!

523
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:07,980
If you succeed, you will get the prize.

524
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:13,980
Endo-kun, what is the third picture?

525
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:15,980
Yes!

526
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:17,980
Shikoku.

527
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:25,980
Shikoku. Three cities other than Tokushima.

528
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:29,980
Kagawa, Ehime, Kochi.

529
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:31,980
I'm starting to understand.

530
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:35,980
Shikoku. Three cities other than Tokushima.

531
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:37,980
Endo, that's not true.

532
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:41,980
You're not going to tell me the truth?

533
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:43,980
You're not going to tell me the truth?

534
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:45,980
No, Endo.

535
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:51,980
When you do this, you should not be so particular about the regular.

536
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:58,980
You should not be so particular about it.

537
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:03,980
House Dance is on the air!

538
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:07,980
The past broadcast is broadcast exclusively on Hulu.

539
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,980
Kyuryu Kensaku!
