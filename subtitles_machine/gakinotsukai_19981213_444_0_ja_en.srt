1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Next time on Gaki no Tsukai Ara!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Chiki Chiki!

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The end of the year!

4
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Kouhaku High Tension Gassen!

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Good evening everyone!

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Good evening!

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Chess is back again.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Yes, I'm the only one who's a little blue.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I've been in the top 10 before.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
That's right.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
It's the end of the year.

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
We're going to have a match with Kouhaku.

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
We, the red team, will do our best.

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Thank you for coming!

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
What are you looking at?

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The white team can't lose either!

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Let's take a look at everyone's recent events this year.

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Animal's monkey.

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
He earned a lot of prize money on the show.

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I don't know at all.

21
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
There was a TV show last year.

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
He earned 1 million yen in 1 minute and a half.

23
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Wow!

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
1 million yen!

25
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
He went to drink with Kouhaku.

26
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I was invited right now.

27
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm just kidding.

28
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Thank you very much.

29
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
The content of the fan letter is mostly about the route.

30
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Should I get a job?

31
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Should I go to high school?

32
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I'm not the real thing.

33
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I can't do that.

34
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
This program is sponsored by the following sponsors.

35
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The top batter is the red team.

36
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Thank you very much.

37
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Mr. Animal.

38
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Thank you very much.

39
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Mr. Monkey will do it.

40
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Yes, Mr. Monkey will do it.

41
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Mr. Kohara will cheer for you.

42
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
That's right.

43
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I'm sure you're nervous because you're the top batter.

44
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I'm nervous.

45
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
What's the title like?

46
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I'm Kato Manager.

47
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

48
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
The title is Kato Manager.

49
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
That's right.

50
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Let's get started.

51
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
The top batter of the red team is Mr. Monkey.

52
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I'm Kato from the Asai Project.

53
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
What are you doing?

54
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Who are you?

55
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
You're pathetic.

56
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
You're pathetic.

57
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
You're pathetic.

58
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
My ex, my ex, my ex.

59
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Have a love affair.

60
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I'm gonna pull out your nose and hands.

61
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
It's gone.

62
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
It's awesome.

63
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Of course you're the top batter in terms of height.

64
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Thank you very much.

65
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
It must be hard for you guys.

66
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
That's a good point.

67
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
It's time for you guys to try something.

68
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I will do my best for my wife

69
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Miyasako will do it

70
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
And 4000 years

71
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
It's hot!

72
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
It's hot!

73
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
It's hot!

74
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
It's hot!

75
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
It's hot!

76
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
It's hot!

77
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
It's hot!

78
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
It's hot!

79
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
It's hot!

80
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
It's hot!

81
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
It's hot!

82
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
It's hot!

83
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
It's hot!

84
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Everyone, come forward!

85
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Da da!

86
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Da da!

87
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Da da!

88
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
That was good!

89
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
That was good!

90
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
That was good!

91
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
That was good!

92
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
While you are the enemy

93
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
No, but

94
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I'm not going to lose like this either.

95
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Let's continue with the next team.

96
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Kokoriko Tanaka Naoki!

97
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
What's going on?

98
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
They've shown us a lot of things.

99
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
We can't lose as a team!

100
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
We can't lose. We have a lot of power right now.

101
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Let's continue.

102
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Kokoriko Tanaka Naoki's...

103
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Otero De Bungee Gaku Bungee!

104
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Hurry!

105
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
More!

106
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
More!

107
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I'm scared!

108
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Stop! Stop!

109
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Hurry and stop!

110
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Jump! Jump!

111
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Jump!

112
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Hurry and jump!

113
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Bungee!

114
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Jump!

115
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Bungee!

116
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Jump!

117
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I'm scared!

118
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
No!

119
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
No!

120
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Alright!

121
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Thank you!

122
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
At first, I thought it was a trick.

123
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Tanaka-san has his own theme.

124
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I understand.

125
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I understand.

126
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
The first team is Jyodanzo!

127
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Jyodanzo!

128
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
It's Yutem's first time on this show.

129
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Can I ask you something?

130
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Sure.

131
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Can I change my clothes?

132
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Sure.

133
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Wait, let's do it together.

134
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Why?

135
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Let's do it together.

136
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
All of us!

137
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
After we do this,

138
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
we'll do the jump.

139
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Let's go!

140
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Jyodanzo's last shout in 1998.

141
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Summer Power!

142
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
You're the best!

143
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
You're the best!

144
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
You're the best!

145
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
You're the best!

146
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
You're the best!

147
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I'm very excited.

148
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I'm very excited.

149
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I'm very excited!

150
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I'm very excited!

151
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Thank you!

152
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I see.

153
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Okay, thank you!

154
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,000
That's why we lost.

155
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
The secret influence of the red team.

156
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Are you okay?

157
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Let's continue.

158
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
The next red team is Ritton Jyodanzo!

159
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Ritton, this is your first time in the studio.

160
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
That's right.

161
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
You've been out all this time.

162
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
And on the phone.

163
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I understand.

164
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I understand.

165
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
That's a self-portrait.

166
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Really?

167
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
What kind of self-portrait is that?

168
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
It's a pajama for women.

169
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Okay, Ritton Jyodanzo.

170
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Please do the human power rescue!

171
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Human power rescue!

172
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Rescue!

173
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Is it a holiday today?

174
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I feel like I'm going to bump into a police officer in Shikoku.

175
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Curry bread! Curry bread!

176
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Do you have a police officer?

177
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I'm going to marry a girl next door.

178
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I'm going to marry a girl next door.

179
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I'm in shock right now.

180
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I'm getting a lot of natto.

181
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I found a hot rice.

182
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I found a hot rice.

183
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I found a hot rice.

184
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I'm going to eat it.

185
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I want to eat natto.

186
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I'm going to lay an egg.

187
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Sometimes it's like a shogi.

188
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I want to be a mischievous woman.

189
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I'm going to lay an egg.

190
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I'm going to lay an egg.

191
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I'm going to lay an egg.

192
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
If it's funny, it's just the end.

193
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I bit my tongue on the way.

194
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
That's because it's cute.

195
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Thank you very much.

196
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I'm going to get cold.

197
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I'm going to get cold.

198
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
The end.

199
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
This is the end.

200
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
You're a normal person.

201
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I'm counting on you.

202
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I don't know if I can do it.

203
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I'm counting on you.

204
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I'm counting on you.

205
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I'm going to change my name.

206
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Fujii Takashide

207
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
HENPIN 98

208
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Sir.

209
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I'm sorry.

210
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
HENPIN 98

211
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Sir.

212
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I can't.

213
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
HENPIN 98

214
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,000
HENPIN Vibration

215
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I can't do it.

216
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Cooling-off!

217
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
That was good.

218
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
That was good.

219
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
That was good.

220
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I won, didn't I?

221
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
You won.

222
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I won.

223
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Yuta, you're always like that at the end.

224
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Finally!

225
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Why is that a bird?

226
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
The red bird!

227
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I got it.

228
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Your face is weird.

229
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,000
The red team will finish it off with this.

230
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Let's go.

231
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
It's Yamanagi Hosei.

232
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
It's a bird.

233
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Whether the red team wins or loses, it's up to me.

234
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Let's do our best!

235
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Well, even if you lose a little bit now, you can make up for it with this bird's effort.

236
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
That's right.

237
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
That's right.

238
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Let's do our best.

239
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Let's go.

240
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Red team's bird, Yamanagi Hosei.

241
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
The 17th edition of the Prondet Competition.

242
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I was born a small bird.

243
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I was a small bird.

244
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I was a small bird.

245
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,000
The song is over.

246
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
It's the best!

247
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
It's the red team's bird.

248
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
It was a little dangerous in the middle, so I added it.

249
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
What do you mean the bird doesn't know the sushi?

250
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Good! Good! Red team!

251
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Red team!

252
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Good!

253
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
It's my bird!

254
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Komori Goen!

255
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
It's up to you.

256
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
But I've already won here.

257
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
The last one is no good.

258
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I added it.

259
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
The face is different.

260
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
That's right.

261
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
It's easy.

262
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
The other team was up and up.

263
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
That's not true.

264
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
It's still the same.

265
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
This is my bird.

266
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
It's the last one this year.

267
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Komori Goen!

268
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Good!

269
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
What are you doing?

270
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
What are you doing?

271
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:30,000
One, two, one, two, three.

272
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
One, two, one, two, three.

273
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Do you believe in the Nostradamus?

274
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:48,000
In 1999, the earth will be destroyed.

275
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:55,000
That's why I want to go to the forest with you.

276
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:18,000
So please make me a bento.

277
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Please make me a bento.

278
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Good!

279
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Both of you have the same bird.

280
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I thought it would be no good.

281
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I thought it would be no good.

282
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
We were surprised, too.

283
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Let's go!

284
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
High tension battle!

285
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Please announce the result!

286
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Good!

287
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Good!

288
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Hiromu wins!

289
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Next year, I won't lose to anyone.

290
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:49,000
He is a taxi driver.

291
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Good!

292
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:04,000
The song came out when it wasn't over yet.

293
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
It doesn't matter.

294
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,000
It was a little interesting for me.

295
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:17,000
This year, the countdown is approaching.

296
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:23,000
One year is over.

297
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Did you participate?

298
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I don't care about that.

299
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I don't care about this year.

300
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I don't care about this year.

301
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Do you know?

302
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I've been a long-seller for a long time.

303
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
But I change the taste every year.

304
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
So I don't get bored.

305
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
What?

306
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
It's a long story.

307
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Why am I compared to ramen?

308
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
It's a long story.

309
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
In your case, you've changed a lot.

310
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I've changed a lot.

311
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Why do you always change the taste every year?

312
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
You're like an Ukrainian.

313
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I don't change the taste every year.

314
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:27,000
You've changed the taste every year.

315
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
But you suddenly change the taste every year.

316
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
This year's news.

317
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Where are you going this year?

318
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Next year.

319
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I'm going to the Netherlands next year.

320
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Are you going to the Netherlands for an interview?

321
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I was the only one who didn't want to take a plane.

322
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I went to Hokkaido last year.

323
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
It's hard in Japan.

324
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Why did you want to take a plane?

325
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I've recently realized that I'm a big guy.

326
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Can't I walk in a big way?

327
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
You can't walk.

328
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Please walk.

329
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I want to walk in a big way.

330
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I'm going to the Netherlands.

331
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I see.

332
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I don't care.

333
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I hate Christmas the most.

334
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Why?

335
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
It's not a good thing.

336
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,000
If you had a lot of fun last year, would you raise your hand?

337
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I can't.

338
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
You can't, can you?

339
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
It hurts to be here.

340
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
You're being introduced.

341
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
It's a little dirty.

342
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
What do you call it?

343
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
A solid meal.

344
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Don't say that.

345
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
What do you call it?

346
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Grilled meat.

347
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Stop it.

348
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I've been booking a hotel for about a year.

349
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
You don't do that these days.

350
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
But there are still a lot of people.

351
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I've already made a reservation.

352
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
What about you?

353
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
What?

354
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Why are you making a fuss?

355
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I'm not making a fuss.

356
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Do you celebrate Christmas?

357
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
No.

358
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I'm being honest.

359
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I usually work on Christmas.

360
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I do.

361
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Did you come down from the mountain?

362
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:30,000
You're a bandit, aren't you?

363
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I say it every year.

364
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Merry Christmas.

365
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
You said you were going to exchange gifts.

366
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
It's a story that ends in five minutes.

367
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
What are you doing there?

368
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I don't know if that's strange.

369
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
You're persistent.

370
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
It's okay if you don't buy it right away.

371
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
It's okay to pull it out at the end.

372
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:57,000
If you don't buy it right away, you'll get into an accident.

373
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:02,000
It's not good to cause an accident on the highway.

374
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
You'll lose your driver's license.

375
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I'll tell you something.

376
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Listen carefully.

377
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
When you have an accident in a car,

378
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,000
don't leave the car in the police car.

379
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
It's a murder scene.

380
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Stop the car.

381
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
You shouldn't leave it like that.

382
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Shut up.

383
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
You think so, don't you?

384
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Everyone thinks so.

385
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
You should not leave it like that.

386
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
You should wear gloves.

387
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
You should buy a card.

388
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Are you stupid?

389
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
The other day, I turned left after crossing the crossing.

390
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
When I was about to turn, he came from behind.

391
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
I stopped.

392
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:51,000
He went in front of my car and hit me on the left side.

393
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
In your car?

394
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
That's right.

395
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
By bicycle?

396
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Yes.

397
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Are you a human being?

398
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
No, no, no.

399
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
It's obvious that you're a human being.

400
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I stopped.

401
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I don't know if you're really stopped.

402
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
You think you're stopped, but you're not.

403
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
I stopped.

404
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
What happened?

405
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
I turned and stopped.

406
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I was waiting for him to come.

407
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
I was surprised.

408
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:24,000
What are you doing?

409
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
I'm sorry.

410
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
I stopped.

411
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I'm sorry.

412
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I'm sorry.

413
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I looked at him, but nothing happened.

414
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Did you hit me?

415
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
That's strange.

416
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
I'll tell you a good thing.

417
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:49,000
I'll tell you what's wrong with Japanese drivers.

418
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Don't think that safe driving means slow driving.

419
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
You can't say it's safe because you're driving slowly.

420
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:02,000
For example, be careful not to fall because you're driving slowly.

421
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,000
It may be safer to drive slowly.

422
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:11,000
It may be safe to drive slowly.

423
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:16,000
But it's not safe to drive slowly.

424
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
I'll tell you a good thing.

425
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
I don't understand it at all.

426
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
I can say that.

427
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I'm confident that I'll get into an accident in a car for the rest of my life.

428
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
I declared it.

429
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:36,000
You went into the parking lot, turned around, and hit me.

430
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
That's a little random.

431
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
It's not random.

432
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,000
You went into the parking lot, turned around, and hit me.

433
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
There was water on the smooth iron plate.

434
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
But you didn't understand the iron plate.

435
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
You should get out of the car.

436
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Because you are a fool.

437
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Thank you very much.

438
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,000
You two are the people who drive a luxury car.

439
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Both of you.

440
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Human desire is really amazing.

441
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Please tell me where you have fallen in love with each other.

442
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,000
I can't beat you.

443
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
You're a pervert.

444
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I'm not more than a normal person.

445
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
I've done this in a double bed.

446
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
I can't beat you.

447
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:40,000
I thought I'd say it one by one.

448
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:47,000
I thought I'd do it little by little.

449
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Suddenly I was surprised.

450
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
There's no next time.

451
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Why?

452
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:00,000
If you go from Hantoubu, that's what happens to the iron plate at home.

453
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
I went to a strange place.

454
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
I went to Yoshimoto Shinkei Station.

455
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
You're an adult.

456
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
I'm in elementary school.

457
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
I'm in junior high school.

458
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:21,000
You're wearing the same suit as me.

459
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:26,000
I'm in Yoshimoto Shinkei Station, so I'm making my debut.

460
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:32,000
There was no video or anything like that.

461
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,000
I found it in an erotic book in the back of the gymnasium.

462
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,000
I was naked in Goro's Mizusawaki.

463
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Did you do it?

464
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,000
When we went to the book store together, I didn't think Mizusawaki was naked.

465
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
When I saw Goro, he was just a little boy.

466
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
We were just little boys.

467
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
I remember it well.

468
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Mizusawaki, take it off.

469
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Give me this.

470
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:11,000
