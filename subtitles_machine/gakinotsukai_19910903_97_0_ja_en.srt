1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
What should we do to celebrate the 100th anniversary of Daki's Skyline?

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
We have to decide soon.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
That's right.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
The date is getting closer.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Even if we get excited, the viewers won't care.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Because it's the time.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
It's Yuka-fensei.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
He's pulling the string.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Let's make it clear today.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Taku-san, do you have anything to say?

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
No, I'm not going to think about it.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
This program is brought to you by these sponsors.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
This program is brought to you by these sponsors.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Team Zero's street TV.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
What does this mean?

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
What does this mean?

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I don't know.

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Say it roughly.

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
It's a street TV.

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
We're probably...

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Don't say probably.

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
We're probably carrying a TV.

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
We're probably carrying a TV.

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
You're carrying a TV?

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
If I were a trident, I'd probably get hit.

26
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
We're probably carrying a TV.

27
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
We're probably carrying a TV.

28
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I see.

29
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
That's what Team Zero's street TV means.

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Let's move on.

31
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Pick one.

32
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
It's a live VTR.

33
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
What does this mean?

34
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
It's a live VTR.

35
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:46,000
It's a live VTR.

36
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
It took you quite some time.

37
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
It took you quite some time.

38
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
That's why...

39
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
It's a live VTR.

40
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Oh, so that's how we do it.

41
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
So we'll show it like a VTR.

42
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Oh, I see.

43
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Hamada, please hold onto this.

44
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Hey, what do you think about this?

45
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I don't like it at all.

46
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
That's not it.

47
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
That's not it.

48
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Team Zero.

49
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Team Zero's watch.

50
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I think this is quite interesting.

51
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
What do you mean?

52
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I've grown up.

53
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
And this guy has become single.

54
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I see.

55
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
And Mr. Perlman,

56
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Mr. Perlman No. 2,

57
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Mr. Perlman No. 2 has become sick.

58
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
That's not it.

59
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
That's not it.

60
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I see.

61
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
It's a big watch.

62
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
You know,

63
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
it's like real time.

64
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
When we're talking,

65
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
like a swimming competition,

66
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
in a random way,

67
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
he goes like a whip.

68
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Then, he comes out.

69
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Does he come out?

70
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
He comes out when the restaurant is full.

71
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
This is the first time I've heard this.

72
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
It's a live show,

73
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
so in thirty minutes,

74
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
The one who can bring it.

75
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
The superstar will eat it,

76
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
and he'll come to the restaurant.

77
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
No one else can do it?

78
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I think it's better to be a talent.

79
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
You call them at the beginning, and bring something before the end.

80
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
That's a good idea.

81
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
It's a common thing.

82
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
This is really...

83
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Is it okay for a writer in Osaka to do this?

84
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
No, no, no, no.

85
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
No, no, no, no.

86
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
The audience's room.

87
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
What about this?

88
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
What does this mean?

89
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
This is the light of the main power.

90
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
The warm peach is different.

91
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I've been warming it for five years.

92
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I put out a paper in a big mammoth's house.

93
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
At night, the guy who's looking at the child turns on the light.

94
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Help me!

95
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
He's a bad guy.

96
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
He's a bad guy.

97
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
He's a bad guy.

98
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
He's a bad guy.

99
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
This is the emergency press conference.

100
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
What do you think, Suzuki?

101
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I thought of a soft head.

102
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I thought of a soft head.

103
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Suzuki, you're really good at talking.

104
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
This is important, too.

105
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
No, no, no, no.

106
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I see. This is Suzuki.

107
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
This is Dada's room.

108
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Get out of here!

109
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
A dreamy present to celebrate the 100th anniversary.

110
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:32,000
This time, it's a really luxurious gift.

111
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I've done it a hundred times.

112
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I'm thinking of preparing a present that will make everyone happy.

113
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I see.

114
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
That's all.

115
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Can I mix it?

116
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Yes, you can.

117
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I can do this.

118
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I've decided to do this live.

119
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Live?

120
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I'll do it live on Tuesday at 1 o'clock.

121
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I'll do it live from 1 o'clock 40 minutes.

122
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I'd like to focus on the 100th anniversary this time.

123
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I'm going to recruit people to come see it.

124
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
100 people? No way.

125
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
100 people.

126
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
100 people.

127
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:21,000
People who come to see the 100th anniversary have to dress up as 100 people.

128
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I have to dress up as one of the 100 people.

129
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
But it's a live broadcast.

130
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
You know what I mean?

131
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
100 people.

132
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
100 people.

133
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
What are you going to dress up as?

134
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Don't say that when you're told to.

135
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Think about it.

136
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
It's a live broadcast.

137
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I'll check it out in advance.

138
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
So I'm not going to say what kind of clothes you're going to wear.

139
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I'll check it out when I'm told to.

140
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I'm not going to say what kind of clothes you're going to wear.

141
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I've been doing this 100 times.

142
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Usually before the show, the audience is informed that they won't be able to laugh.

143
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
That's right.

144
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
When it's tough.

145
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
There's a lot of information that it's going to be tough today.

146
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
That's right.

147
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Really.

148
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
As I said earlier, the world is getting excited.

149
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Is it getting excited?

150
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Is it going to be a lot of fun?

151
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
The audience is going to be excited.

152
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Is it going to be fun?

153
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I don't know about you, but it's totally different when the audience is there and when they're not.

154
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
It's totally different.

155
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
We've been waiting for the concert.

156
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
There's a terrible place.

157
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Where is it?

158
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Maizuru.

159
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Maizuru?

160
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
It's terrible.

161
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
It was terrible.

162
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
It was about the number of people in the entertainment world.

163
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
We were doing our best at the concert.

164
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
We sang the whole song.

165
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
You sang the whole song.

166
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Yes.

167
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
And then, the paper.

168
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
The big paper.

169
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
At first, only the silhouette was shown.

170
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
When we were in the audience, our silhouettes were shown.

171
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
And then, it was like this.

172
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
You ripped the paper.

173
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
You ripped it.

174
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
The opening song was like this.

175
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
The fans were like this.

176
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
That's right.

177
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
That's Maizuru.

178
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Really.

179
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
It's true.

180
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
It's true.

181
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
We were singing like this.

182
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Really.

183
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
It's true.

184
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
When the concert was over, most of the people in the hall said,

185
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Please leave immediately.

186
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
We have a taxi waiting at the back door.

187
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Please leave immediately.

188
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
We were panicking.

189
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
We were like,

190
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Is that so?

191
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Maizuru.

192
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
It's totally different.

193
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
When the concert was over,

194
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Who was there?

195
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Before the concert started, it was terrible.

196
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Normally, before the concert starts, there are many people.

197
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
But Maizuru, 5 minutes before the concert starts, there are no people.

198
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
And then, about 2 minutes before the concert starts,

199
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
The car is coming.

200
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Really.

201
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
The car is coming from everywhere.

202
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
We were not excited at all.

203
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
We were in a low tension.

204
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
We stopped the car like this.

205
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Right?

206
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
It was terrible.

207
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
When the concert was over,

208
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Everyone was like,

209
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
What are you doing?

210
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
We were selling goods.

211
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Give me that.

212
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Give me that.

213
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
It's a downtown T-shirt.

214
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
After the concert was over,

215
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Everyone went to the bicycle park again.

216
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
We were like,

217
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
The yakuza is leading the way.

218
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
It's terrible.

219
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Normally,

220
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Can you listen to me?

221
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Yes.

222
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
At the concert,

223
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
The people in front of us are really excited.

224
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
They came all the way here,

225
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
And they were riding the yakuza.

226
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
We were riding the yakuza.

227
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
We were riding the yakuza.

228
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
The yakuza was leading the way.

229
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
We were riding the yakuza.

230
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
We were riding the yakuza.

231
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
While everyone was riding the yakuza,

232
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
The yakuza came in front of us.

233
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Hey!

234
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Hey!

235
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Excuse me.

236
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I'm singing.

237
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I'm singing.

238
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I'm singing.

239
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Sit down.

240
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Sit down.

241
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Everyone was sitting down.

242
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
It's true.

243
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
It's true.

244
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Everyone was singing like this.

245
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Like this.

246
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Yes.

247
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Everyone was standing up.

248
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Sit down.

249
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
It was like this again.

250
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
There was no concert like that.

251
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
No.

252
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
We were standing here.

253
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
We were standing here.

254
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
The yakuza.

255
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
It wasn't just one person.

256
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Everyone was standing here.

257
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
It's true.

258
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Everyone was standing in front of us.

259
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Like this.

260
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
It's like this.

261
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
When we have concerts,

262
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
We want to look like musicians.

263
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Even if we say that.

264
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
So,

265
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
We put up posters on the poles.

266
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Downtown Concert.

267
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
If we put up more cool posters,

268
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
My face will be smiling and smiling.

269
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
And my face will be in the picture.

270
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
And my tongue will be in the picture.

271
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Like this.

272
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Do you understand?

273
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
It's like a picture of a supermarket.

274
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Yes.

275
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
My face will be smiling.

276
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
And my tongue will be in the picture.

277
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I can't do that.

278
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Even though I'm dressed up.

279
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Yes.

280
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
That's how it is.

281
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Do you want to go to the theater?

282
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Sure.

283
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Do you want to talk more?

284
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I went to the theater in Osaka after a long time.

285
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
It was a summer vacation.

286
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
When I went to the theater,

287
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,000
The next door was on fire.

288
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I saw the spirit of Osaka businessmen.

289
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:20,000
NGK is a takoyaki shop next to the theater.

290
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
And there is a karaoke box next to it.

291
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
That's the fire.

292
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
There are five fire trucks.

293
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
There is no line in front of the store.

294
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
It's amazing.

295
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:37,000
But the man in the takoyaki shop is baking takoyaki.

296
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I was surprised.

297
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
And there are people who come to buy takoyaki.

298
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Then the man said,

299
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
It's not baked yet.

300
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
It's not baked yet.

301
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Do you want to eat takoyaki?

302
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Yes.

303
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Why do you come here?

304
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
What?

305
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
It doesn't mean anything.

306
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Don't look at me like that.

307
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Why?

308
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
What?

309
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Don't look at me like that.

310
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I was cold in my friend's dressing room.

311
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
What?

312
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Tetsuko's room.

313
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I want to go out.

314
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:23,000
It was very painful.

315
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
It doesn't mean anything.

316
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
You kicked me.

317
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I have a lot of fans.

318
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I'm sorry.

319
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
No.

320
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
You said it was your fault.

321
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Why do you blame me?

322
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
It's dirty.

323
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Why do you blame me?

324
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
It's my job.

325
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
No.

326
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I have a different job on Tuesday.

327
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,000
You said we should find another job.

328
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I came here today.

329
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Someone is coming to your room.

330
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:04,000
When did you call me your friend on Tuesday?

331
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I didn't know that you were my friend.

332
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I know, I know.

333
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
You know?

334
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I know, I know.

335
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
That's why, I heard that you are doing many movies.

336
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
You can do it with me.

337
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
If I finish that, I can't go to the next job.

338
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
You have to do it properly.

339
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
No, if you want to do it, you have to do it.

340
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
It's big.

341
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
It's already a big mess.

342
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
No, then,

343
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I said I'll do it on Tuesday from the beginning.

344
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
No, let me do it. If you do that, I can't do it.

345
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
It's better to do two jobs than three jobs.

346
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Your opponent is Satcher.

347
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
You don't know a man and a woman.

348
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
But I know that it's a big mess.

349
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Then, tell me what you were doing.

350
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Satcher?

351
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Yes, Satcher is that.

352
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
He is the chief of staff.

353
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:09,000
At that time, the country is different.

354
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Oh, sorry, sorry.

355
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Are you talking about that Satcher?

356
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Which Satcher are you talking about?

357
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I'm talking about Satcher.

358
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I don't know about that.

359
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I'm talking about Satcher on TV.

360
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
That's strange.

361
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Oh, Satcher. I know, I know.

362
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Then, tell me what you were doing.

363
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I know about Satcher very well.

364
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
So what?

365
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Satcher had a hard time.

366
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
That's right.

367
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
But it looks like that.

368
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
It's the part of the housekeeper.

369
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I didn't know that.

370
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I knew it was hard,

371
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
but I didn't know it was the housekeeper.

372
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Why?

373
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Satcher was in a bad mood.

374
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Oh, I see.

375
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:07,000
How can I say?

376
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
When he was angry, he was angry.

377
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
What are you talking about?

378
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I've been talking about politics for a while.

379
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Actually, there was a painting we went to the temple before, right?

380
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
It was the painting of the secretary of Kaifushou.

381
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Is that Mr. Memoto Ryuichi?

382
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
He's a great person.

383
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
He was chosen.

384
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Do you have a name card?

385
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
The other day, too.

386
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
What's your hobby?

387
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Kaifu Toshiki.

388
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
What's your hobby?

389
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Watching downtown TV.

390
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
That's amazing.

391
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
That's me.

392
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I'm the secretary of the Prime Minister of the Cabinet, Memoto Ryuichi.

393
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
What kind of work do you do?

394
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I make tea.

395
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
What?

396
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Do you run?

397
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Is that so?

398
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
That's my job.

399
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Do you have a secret?

400
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,000
It's a trick.

401
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Yes.

402
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:19,000
What is it that you're doing in the Prime Minister's room?

403
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I don't have a secret.

404
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,000
What do you do sometimes?

405
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
It's really funny.

406
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Thank you very much.

407
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I'm sorry.

408
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
It's amazing, isn't it?

409
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Thank you for coming.

410
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I didn't think it would be such a light program.

411
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I'm watching it.

412
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I can't say anything bad.

413
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,000
When I was listening to the live broadcast of the F1 race, the announcer said,

414
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Ayrton Senna is dancing in the first place.

415
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
But he doesn't look like he's dancing at all.

416
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:00,000
What does this mean?

417
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I can't see it, but he's doing this.

418
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:16,000
When he's doing this, I feel like he's doing this.

419
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I don't know.

420
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
If he's Japanese, he's not dead yet.

421
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Why is a foreigner doing this?

422
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I can't see it, but he's doing this.

423
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
What is this?

424
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I'm saying how I feel.

425
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
How about you?

426
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:38,000
How do you feel when you take a step forward when you're competing?

427
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I'm happy.

428
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
You're happy, aren't you?

429
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:46,000
That feeling.

430
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I can't see it, but he's doing this in his mind.

431
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I understand.

432
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
That's right.

433
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
That's right.

434
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I see.

435
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
He used to say that.

436
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,000
He said he was dancing.

437
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I have another question.

438
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Why do you call Kyoko Suizenji a cheater?

439
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I'm sorry, Machan.

440
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I really don't know.

441
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Actually, this is...

442
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Why?

443
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
It's true.

444
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Normally, names go well with each other.

445
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Like this, I guess.

446
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
That's a really good one.

447
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
This is wonderful.

448
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
It is!

449
00:18:44,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Well, it would be great if you could wear it, but if someone asks you to do something, or if you want to make a phone call to the opening, I don't know if you can do it.

450
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
We don't know about this.

451
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
We don't know.

452
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
It's a problem.

453
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Why do you always wear shirts, neckties, and suits? When you were in school, you wore T-shirts, checkered pants, and berets. You were so young.

454
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:22,000
But you always wore a strange-looking shirt and pants.

455
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I don't think that's cute.

456
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Next time, you should try wearing your clothes.

457
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Hey, do you want to wear this?

458
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
So, let's do that next week.

459
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Next week?

460
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:45,000
So, I want you to prepare your usual clothes. I don't know if I should wear it or not.

461
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
But I don't want to wear it.

462
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
You have to fix it.

463
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:54,000
I'll leave it as it is.

464
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
You have to change it.

465
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Oh, really?

466
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Yeah.

467
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
I'm going to fold my pants a little.

468
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
What?

469
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
You're going to fold your pants?

470
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:11,000
What?

471
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:16,000
It's too long, so I'm going to fold my pants.

472
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
What kind of word is that?

473
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
What kind of word is that?

474
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
There's no word for it.

475
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,000
What kind of sentence is that?

476
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I don't think there's a word like that in this world.

477
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:37,000
In your novel, Makiko was folding her pants.

478
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,000
That's what happens when a real Osaka person writes it.

479
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
That's not true.

480
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
It's true.

481
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
I've never heard of it.

482
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
That's not true.

483
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
So, I'm going to leave it as it is.

484
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
All the hem.

485
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
That's fine.

486
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:55,000
When this is over, I'll change it to your clothes.

487
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
All right.

488
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Well, everyone.

489
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Goodbye.

490
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Goodbye.

491
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Hello.

492
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Hello, hello, hello.

493
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Here we are.

494
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
It's the 100th anniversary.

495
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
That's right.

496
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I said it in my head, but this is a live broadcast.

497
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
It's a live broadcast.

498
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
That's great.

499
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
But there's a condition for you to come.

500
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
There's a night's event.

501
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
There's someone who can go home from there.

502
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
I'll be on time.

503
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I'm running the train.

504
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Only on my way home.

505
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Only on your way home.

506
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Only on your way home.

507
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I'd like to have someone who can go home properly.

508
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
It's a 100th anniversary.

509
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
I said it in my head.

510
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
It's a costume that's one of the 100.

511
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
That's right.

512
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
There are various costumes in Kanda.

513
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
That's right.

514
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Is it Hyakutaro?

515
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Well, that's what I thought last year.

516
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Is that what you mean?

517
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Yes.

518
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Well, if you come, there's definitely something good.

519
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Really, really.

520
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
I came to see it.

521
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I became a guest.

522
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I became a guest.

523
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
That's right.

524
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
The staff probably thinks so, too.

525
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
That's right.

526
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:26,000
I want a picture of Parman No. 2 at the previous ending.

527
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
I want this, too.

528
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
I put it out here.

529
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Yes, it's out.

530
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Is it out?

531
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Time and place.

532
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Yes.

533
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Please gather here.

534
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
I want that panel.

535
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
It's a Parman No. 2 panel.

536
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
People who come.

537
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
That's the kind of costume.

538
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:45,000
I don't like it.

539
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,000
It doesn't have to be No. 2.

540
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
It can be Parman.

541
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
It can be Paran.

542
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
It can be Pargo.

543
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Well, please come in that kind of costume.

544
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Otherwise.

545
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
My Parman No. 2.

546
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I'm waiting in that kind of costume.

547
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
I see.

548
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Yes.

549
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
For those who came.

550
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Commemorative photos and signs.

551
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
I understand.

552
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
And handshakes.

553
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Yes.

554
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
I've got that kind of thing ready.

555
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
