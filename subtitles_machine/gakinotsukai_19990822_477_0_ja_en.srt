1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
In the end, Yamazaki said that he would be reborn as a comedian.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
So what did he say?

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:16,000
We don't really know, but he said that he would be reborn as a comedian.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
He said that he would be reborn as a comedian.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:27,000
He said that he would be reborn as a comedian.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
After he met us, he said that he would do 100 push-ups.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
We said that it would be impossible, but I said I would do it.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
To be honest, 100 is a little too much.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm doing it.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
He said that he would do 100 push-ups.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
He said that he would do 100 push-ups.

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
You two can't hear me.

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,000
You guys want to sell mahjong.

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
That's difficult to understand.

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:22,000
This program is brought to you by the following sponsors.

16
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Luna Arte!

17
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Luna Arte? What does that mean?

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I was surprised.

19
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
What are you talking about?

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Yamazaki-san, there are other customers.

21
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Did you have a meeting?

22
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
What?

23
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Did you have a meeting?

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Sorry.

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Did your mother call you?

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Why?

27
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Do you want to talk?

28
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Do you want to talk?

29
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Sorry.

30
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
What kind of room is this?

31
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
What is this?

32
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
But there was a bad weather today.

33
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Yes.

34
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Where is it?

35
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Is it cloudy?

36
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
There was a bad weather.

37
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
The temperature was about 34 degrees.

38
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Really?

39
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
It's very hot. 34 degrees.

40
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
It's hot.

41
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
It's 36 degrees.

42
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
It's hot at 39 degrees.

43
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
It's hot. I can't sleep.

44
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
What's going on?

45
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,000
You're the one who had to move the glass in front of you.

46
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
You're the one who had to move the glass in front of you.

47
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
You don't talk at all.

48
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
What?

49
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Are you always like this?

50
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
No, I don't talk at all.

51
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I'm hungry.

52
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
You look like you're hungry.

53
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Why is it?

54
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Everyone is looking forward to why you're hungry.

55
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Do you have something to do?

56
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I don't have anything to do.

57
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
What?

58
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I don't have anything to do.

59
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
But I don't think I'm going to eat it all.

60
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I don't think so.

61
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I'm going to eat a lot of Shinto food.

62
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I have to eat 10 servings of fried chicken.

63
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Which one?

64
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Do you want to have a blind date?

65
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I'll have a blind date.

66
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
What are you talking about?

67
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Hamada-san, too.

68
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I'll have a blind date.

69
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
You're having a blind date in the middle of the night.

70
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I want to be like Hamada-san.

71
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I don't think the types are the same.

72
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I don't think the types are the same.

73
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
They're all the same.

74
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Hamada-san has a cute face.

75
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
It's not like that.

76
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
It's not like that.

77
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
There's a position.

78
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
It's not about who's good or bad.

79
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
That's right.

80
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
It's not about who's good or bad.

81
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
That's right.

82
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
That's right.

83
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
It's a game of taking positions.

84
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
It's a game of taking positions.

85
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
It's a game of taking positions.

86
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
But you haven't been talking to each other since then.

87
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
That's right.

88
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
That's right.

89
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Here it comes.

90
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
You're making fun of Don-Guri Manako.

91
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
What are you laughing at?

92
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
You're making fun of Don-Guri Manako.

93
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Sing. Sing. Don-Guri Manako.

94
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Can I go home now?

95
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Wait a minute.

96
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
It's about time.

97
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Wait a minute.

98
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
It's too early to change.

99
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:18,000
What are you?

100
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
That's enough.

101
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
What are you doing?

102
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Yamaguchi-san.

103
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Yamaguchi-san.

104
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I was talking about the resort mansion.

105
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I was talking about the resort mansion at the convenience store.

106
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Don't make fun of me.

107
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Can I smoke?

108
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
You can smoke.

109
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
You're a comedian.

110
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Excuse me.

111
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Excuse me.

112
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Mild Seven. Mild Seven. Mild Seven.

113
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Marlboro Light.

114
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
You scared me.

115
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
It's like a pigeon has shot a bean gun.

116
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
It's like a pigeon has shot a bean gun.

117
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I'm the one who should be talking to you.

118
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Don't talk to me.

119
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
It's too much.

120
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
It's not too much.

121
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Hey, hey, hey.

122
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Bicycle. Bicycle.

123
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Mr. Noppa. Mr. Noppa. Mr. Noppa.

124
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Mr. Noppa.

125
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
What are you looking at?

126
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
What are you looking at?

127
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
What are you laughing at?

128
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Yamaguchi Yasuko.

129
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I'm going to call you.

130
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I'm going to call you.

131
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I'm going to make you the host of Yamaguchi Yasuko.

132
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
What?

133
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Don't you have anything to say?

134
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
No.

135
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Not at all.

136
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
It's painful.

137
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
To be here.

138
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
It's my first time at such a tough coffee shop.

139
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,000
That's because you're wearing a shirt that tightens your neck.

140
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
You're a fool.

141
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
You're a fool.

142
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Yamaguchi-san.

143
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Yamaguchi-san, you're a big guy.

144
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I've been watching you for a long time.

145
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I'm scared even if you get angry because I can't get into it.

146
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I'm going to the bathroom.

147
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Yes.

148
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
What are you eating? What are you eating?

149
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Don't eat cream cheese cake.

150
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Diet. Diet.

151
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Do you want me to listen to your phone calls?

152
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Can you even listen to the radio?

153
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
You're embarrassing me.

154
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
You're embarrassing me.

155
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Tanaka.

156
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
What's going on?

157
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
You were really determined.

158
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I don't like it.

159
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I think you're going to be reborn.

160
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
It's not a compliment.

161
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Should I be like a fool?

162
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Yes, it's a little ridiculous.

163
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Yes, really.

164
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
The audience around you.

165
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I'm going to go in more and more.

166
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Can I smoke?

167
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
What?

168
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I'm telling you to smoke. I'm telling you to smoke.

169
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Hey.

170
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Yes.

171
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
You're late.

172
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
You're late. Why are you eating so much?

173
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
It was the other way around. I'm sorry.

174
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I don't think I can say it anymore.

175
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
If you don't say it, it's hard to be a fool.

176
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Is there anything hard about it?

177
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Hey, what are you looking at?

178
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Hey, say something.

179
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Say something.

180
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
You're not wearing a hat properly. Say something.

181
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I'm not wearing a hat properly.

182
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
That's what I said.

183
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Are you the last emperor?

184
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I don't need that.

185
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I don't need it.

186
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I don't need it.

187
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I don't need it.

188
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
My nose is running.

189
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I have a runny nose.

190
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,000
This is what I wanted you to say.

191
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Oh, here it comes.

192
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Candies are coming in.

193
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Highlights are coming in.

194
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Highlights.

195
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

196
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I'm Kintaro.

197
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I heard a fly.

198
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Who pulled it?

199
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Please forgive me.

200
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Please forgive me.

201
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
You're all over the place.

202
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
No, please forgive me.

203
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I don't want to.

204
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
What do you hate?

205
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Hey, hey, do whatever you like!

206
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
L Whore!

207
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
That's the truth!

208
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Let me tell you something.

209
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,200
I'm over you.

210
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Why?

211
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I'm done with this.

212
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
If not, I'm done.

213
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
What?

214
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
It's not cool.

215
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
It's not cool?

216
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Yes.

217
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
It's because there's another funny one.

218
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
There's another funny one, but it's not cool?

219
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Yeah.

220
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
It's not cool.

221
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
It's funny.

222
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
It's not funny?

223
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
It's not funny!

224
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
It's not funny anymore.

225
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
What kind of meeting is this?

226
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
It's funny if you keep looking at it.

227
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
What are you doing?

228
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Are you looking at the cell phone number?

229
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Huh?

230
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Hey!

231
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
This is a big deal.

232
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
This is a big deal.

233
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Yes, what is it?

234
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
What are you doing?

235
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Yes!

236
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Congratulations to Yamazaki Tsukkomi 100th time!

237
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Yes!

238
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Well, goodbye.

239
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Can you still run away?

240
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
At the end.

241
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I thought you were going to do a game of mahjong.

242
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
It's the first time.

243
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
You should have just walked.

244
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
That's the worst.

245
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
If it's like this.

246
00:10:36,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I got caught.

247
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Thank you.

248
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Thank you.

249
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
What do you think of Pokemon?

250
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Why are you asking me about Pokemon?

251
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I don't know anything about it.

252
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Is it in the news?

253
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
What's in it?

254
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
The audience?

255
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
The movie?

256
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
It's in the news.

257
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I see.

258
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I can't accept Pokemon.

259
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I don't know anything about it.

260
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
It's strange.

261
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Why?

262
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Pikachu, Pikachu.

263
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Pikachu is Pikachu.

264
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Don't be so stupid.

265
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
That's what I think.

266
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
What do you mean?

267
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
You're just shouting your name.

268
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
But.

269
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
For example, if I say,

270
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Matsumoto Higashi!

271
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Matsu!

272
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
But if you say that, they won't talk.

273
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Pikachu!

274
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
It's your name.

275
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I don't understand the truth of a child who says that.

276
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
You like Pikachu, don't you?

277
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I like it.

278
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Pikachu.

279
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I have a card.

280
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I'm collecting it.

281
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Let me say something about money.

282
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
My dad is an entertainer.

283
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I have money.

284
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I don't understand.

285
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
If I were a child, I wouldn't have liked Pikachu.

286
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I hated it since I was a child.

287
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
For example, when Kamen Rider was popular,

288
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
everyone wore Kamen Rider sneakers.

289
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I don't know that.

290
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
There's a picture of Kamen Rider here.

291
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
But I'm a child, so it's strange.

292
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Kamen Rider doesn't wear such shoes.

293
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
That's right.

294
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Kamen Rider wears boots.

295
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:04,000
If you wear Kamen Rider sneakers and say Kamen Rider sneakers,

296
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
you're going to the farthest place from Kamen Rider.

297
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
That's why I've never worn it.

298
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
That's right.

299
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Kamen Rider sneakers, Kamen Rider furikake.

300
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
If you say Kamen Rider furikake, you won't eat anything.

301
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I don't care about that.

302
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:24,000
But if you say Kamen Rider furikake, it doesn't taste like Kamen Rider.

303
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,000
If it tastes like Mettou.

304
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
You'd buy it, right?

305
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I'd buy it.

306
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I'd buy it.

307
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I'd buy it.

308
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
But if you say Kamen Rider furikake,

309
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Kamen Rider won't eat Kamen Rider furikake.

310
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I don't know that.

311
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I couldn't keep up with that when I was a child.

312
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
If I kept saying that, Matsumoto would feel bad.

313
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I didn't have any friends.

314
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I didn't have any friends.

315
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
We were talking in the dressing room.

316
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I heard it from somewhere.

317
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I don't know if I should say it or not.

318
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,000
A 3-year-old boy came out to the dressing room.

319
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
He took it off!

320
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
What do you mean he took it off?

321
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
What are you talking about?

322
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
He took it off.

323
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
What are you talking about?

324
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
What are you talking about?

325
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
What are you talking about?

326
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
That's not true.

327
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
No way!

328
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Really?

329
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Then I'll say it.

330
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I'll say it.

331
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
It's my fault.

332
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
from first

333
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
You go.

334
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
You become bigger.

335
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
You have a boom.

336
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Yeah.

337
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
A boom.

338
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
A boom.

339
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
This is the worst.

340
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Didn't I tell you?

341
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Come here. No, no, no.

342
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Isn't it really interesting?

343
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Come here.

344
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Come here.

345
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
The producer immediately came and told him to stop it.

346
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Tell him to stop all the cameras.

347
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
And there's a guest, right?

348
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Guest.

349
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
To the guest, this thing...

350
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Don't reveal it at all.

351
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Don't reveal it at all.

352
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Even if you go home, it's ***.

353
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I don't get it.

354
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I said, okay.

355
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Everyone was returned.

356
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
The guest immediately returned it.

357
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
As if nothing happened, *** came again.

358
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
What?

359
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Where are the 50 points?

360
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Where are the 50 points?

361
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Even though he came down, he's here.

362
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
50 points.

363
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
In this shape.

364
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Even now, where are the 50 points?

365
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
What do you mean, even now?

366
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Wow, that's amazing.

367
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
That's the rumor.

368
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Even I didn't know.

369
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I don't know if this is true or not.

370
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I don't think that person did it.

371
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I don't think that person did it.

372
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
But he said he would definitely know.

373
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
So it's a rumor now.

374
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
It's a rumor, right?

375
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
It's a rumor, right?

376
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:51,000
If that story was true,

377
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I shouldn't do it.

378
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
But he didn't think of telling the truth.

379
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
He didn't think of telling the truth.

380
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
He didn't think of telling the truth.

381
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
He was too enthusiastic.

382
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
He was too enthusiastic.

383
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
He should have thrown his head.

384
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
He should have thrown his head.

385
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
He should have been careful.

386
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
He should have been careful.

387
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
That's why it's written in writing.

388
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Is this real?

389
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I got a 2.

390
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I heard that this will be written.

391
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
This one, right?

392
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
This is...

393
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
This is...

394
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
This is occult!

395
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
This is Matsumoto-san, famous for being the first to distinguish garbage in Japan.

396
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Yes, that's right.

397
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Matsumoto-san is said to be able to distinguish between men and women.

398
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Even if a child in front of a TV is watching, he won't be attracted to it. Please explain.

399
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
You have two children, right?

400
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Yes, yes.

401
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
A boy and a girl, right?

402
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
A boy and a girl.

403
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
It's a boy and a girl. What is this?

404
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Why?

405
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
You really wanted a boy and a girl, right?

406
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Why is that?

407
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
A boy and a girl is a bit boring, right?

408
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
What do you mean by boring?

409
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Because when you get home, you're covered in s**t.

410
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Covered in s**t, my home sweet memory.

411
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
This is weird.

412
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
What do you want?

413
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Matsumoto-san, you can't distinguish between men and women.

414
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
That's why you want to be the third person to be a woman, right?

415
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Men, men, men.

416
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
That's right.

417
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
More than men, men, men.

418
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
That's why I'm going to teach you those things.

419
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Is that so?

420
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I'll teach you both.

421
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
What for?

422
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I'll teach you to distinguish between men and women.

423
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
That's fine.

424
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Men and women.

425
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
That's fine.

426
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I'll teach you to distinguish between men and women first.

427
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Wait a minute.

428
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I'll teach you once you understand all of this.

429
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Then I'll wait.

430
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
This is the only thing I want to talk about.

431
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Men's expressions.

432
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Men's expressions don't change?

433
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
They do.

434
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Men are about power.

435
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
And women are about kindness.

436
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
This is the theme.

437
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:25,000
If you don't protect that, you can't distinguish between men and women.

438
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,000
From now on, you shouldn't look at little girls too much.

439
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
It's a very hard topic.

440
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
I'll try to suppress it as much as I can.

441
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
That's right.

442
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
There's a situation like this.

443
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
In the end, it's like this.

444
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
What should I do?

445
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
In the end...

446
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Then you.

447
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
You can do anything.

448
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Look at me.

449
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Look at my face.

450
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
What do you mean by your face?

451
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Like this?

452
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
That's not good.

453
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:07,000
When you want a man, you have to be more powerful.

454
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
This is a man.

455
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,000
And women are women.

456
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
You have to emphasize kindness.

457
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
That's how you can distinguish between men and women.

458
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
You can't do that with your face.

459
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
You can't do that with your face.

460
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:27,000
You can't do that with your face.

461
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I think you've always been like this.

462
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
I see.

463
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
So from now on...

464
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
From now on...

465
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
From now on...

466
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:45,000
You can't do that with your face.

467
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
You can't do that with your face.

468
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
But at that time, you didn't look like this.

469
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
You're like this.

470
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
You're like this.

471
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:02,000
When the two of you are together, this girl will be born.

472
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
You have to have a kind face.

473
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Kind face.

474
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Please make a kind face.

475
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
I'll take a nice tissue.

476
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
It's over.

477
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Mr. Matsumoto, who is the leader of all sports and has disciples all over the world, has a question.

478
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Yes, I have disciples all over the world.

479
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
There are players who throw hammers and throw spears.

480
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
There are also baseball pitchers who shout loudly after throwing.

481
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
You don't look like you're shouting.

482
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Is there a sport where shouting increases your record?

483
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Of course there is.

484
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
You can see the difference between hammers and spears.

485
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
You can see the difference between hammers and spears.

486
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
You can see the difference between hammers and spears.

487
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

488
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Rock-paper-scissors.

489
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Rock-paper-scissors.

490
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
I lost.

491
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:48,000
I lost because I didn't shout.

492
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Isn't it just sports?

493
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
It's not just sports.

494
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
It's concentration.

495
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Rock-paper-scissors.

496
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:00,000
I lost because I didn't shout.

497
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
What kind of woman am I?

498
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Right?

499
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Next, let's shout.

500
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Let's go.

501
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I can go, right?

502
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Let's go.

503
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
It's very difficult.

504
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Rock-paper-scissors.

505
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Can you read the atmosphere?

506
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
What are you doing?

507
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
You understand, right?

508
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Why don't you understand?

509
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,000
But it's the same for everything.

510
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
It's the same for the back.

511
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
What do you mean?

512
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Say something.

513
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Apple.

514
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Say something.

515
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Say something.

516
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Watermelon.

517
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
It's strange.

518
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Say something.

519
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
It's not the answer.

520
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Say something.

521
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Say something.

522
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Say something.

523
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Say something.

524
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,000
TV.

525
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Shoes.

526
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
You just have to shout.

527
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Don't look down on me.

528
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,000
It's difficult.

529
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Actually...

530
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Let's stop.

531
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
What?

532
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Let's stop.

533
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
It's okay.

534
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
I just heard it.

535
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
It's okay.

536
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
I didn't see it.

537
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
That's all.

538
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
That's all.

539
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Everyone, really.

540
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
I didn't hear anything.

541
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
When you say it to someone you know...

542
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Why?

543
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
This is really...

544
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Why?

545
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
This is really...

546
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
It's your song.

547
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
It's really...

548
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
What are you doing?

549
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Seriously.

550
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
It's okay.

551
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:23,000
This program was brought to you by these sponsors.
