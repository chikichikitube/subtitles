1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Pikkashi Kankan is here to entertain you!

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Now, it's time for Pikkashi Kankan.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I'm here to entertain you.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm the mascot of Gaki no Tsukai, Pricci Suzuki.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I'm an announcer.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Now, let's welcome the team to the stage.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
It's the Hama-chan team and the Machan team.

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Now, let's introduce ourselves.

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Let's start with the Machan team.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm Okkun, also known as Matsumoto Hitoshi.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Nice to meet you.

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm Takahashi Harumi, an amateur.

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Nice to meet you.

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm Keiko Oe, from Saitama prefecture.

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Nice to meet you.

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Now, it's the Hama-chan team.

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Good evening.

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I'm Otomo, from Chofu prefecture.

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Nice to meet you.

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm the manager from Tokyo, Nitta.

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Nice to meet you.

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
The manager, Nitta-san, is also here.

23
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I'll do my best!

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Now, let's hear from the captains.

25
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
What?

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I'm sorry.

27
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
It's late at night, so I can't help it.

28
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I'd like to hear about your enthusiasm.

29
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Let's start with the Machan captain.

30
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I'm not going to lose to these dirty, rotten guys.

31
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
It's our fault, right?

32
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
You look a bit like Chibita.

33
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Now, let's start with the first question.

34
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,000
It's late at night, at 1.40 p.m., sometimes it's 2.10 p.m.

35
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Everyone, wake up and look at this.

36
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
What are you talking about?

37
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
This is a photo.

38
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Please look at this.

39
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
This is the photo of today's guest.

40
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
This is the person in this photo.

41
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Is that the person?

42
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
The little girl on the right?

43
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
That's me.

44
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Now, who is the owner of this photo?

45
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Let's hear from the Machan team.

46
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Fuse Akira.

47
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
You're younger than me.

48
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
That's a bit different.

49
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Oh Sadaharu-san.

50
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
It's similar.

51
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
How is it?

52
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Kuruma Dankichi-san.

53
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Ah...

54
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Now, the Machan team.

55
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Nitta Junichi.

56
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Isn't that a bit too young?

57
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Tachi Hiroshi.

58
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Kuruka?

59
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Sakagami Jiro.

60
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Sakagami Jiro.

61
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
It looks like you're a bit off track.

62
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Now, the Machan team.

63
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Morishinichi.

64
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
U-chan.

65
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Watanabe Masayuki-san.

66
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Now, the Machan team.

67
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Are you laughing?

68
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Well, I guess you could say that.

69
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Don't think too much.

70
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
You have to say it properly.

71
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
You're annoying.

72
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
You're wearing that brown outfit.

73
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I don't know your name very well, but it's you.

74
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Now, Hamada-san.

75
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Captain Morishinichi.

76
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
You're still saying Hamada?

77
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Really?

78
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Did you say Hakashin-go?

79
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Morishinichi-san.

80
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
It's a bit different.

81
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Atsumi Jiro-san.

82
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
You're saying Sannosen-yan.

83
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Hazama Kanpei-san.

84
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Hazama Kanpei-san.

85
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
It's a bit of a shame that Boo came out.

86
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Now, let's have the guest of the day come on stage.

87
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Please.

88
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Let's go!

89
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
It's Saito-san.

90
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
But, you know, you have a cute face when you're little.

91
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Don't I look like him?

92
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
You do!

93
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I didn't think you'd become so big that you'd get electrocuted.

94
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
The kids are watching, too.

95
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
How old were you when you took this picture?

96
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
About five years from now, right?

97
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Your mouth is a bit different now, too.

98
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
You used to be so chubby back then.

99
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Why are you so chubby now?

100
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I used to be chubby.

101
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I changed all my teeth.

102
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I had braces, but they came out again.

103
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
They do!

104
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
You're funny!

105
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Like this, you've overcome 30 difficulties.

106
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
You bastard!

107
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Don't talk to me like that!

108
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I'm free to do whatever I want!

109
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Thank you very much.

110
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I'm done with you!

111
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I'm going to electrocute you!

112
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Now, let's have Saito-san, the director of Kiseki who has overcome his difficulties and grown up to this point.

113
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,000
When Saito-san drinks, he always electrocutes the girl sitting next to him.

114
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
At that time, he said,

115
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I saw you and I got electrocuted.

116
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,000
But what exactly is this electrocution?

117
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Now, Machan Team!

118
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I saw you and I got smaller.

119
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
You're doing it!

120
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I saw you and I got smaller.

121
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
You're doing it!

122
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Now, Hama-chan Team!

123
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
We often go to karaoke together.

124
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,000
The girl sitting next to me asked me to marry her.

125
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
So I wanted to marry her.

126
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
You're a little too direct.

127
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I wanted to do it.

128
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Thank you very much.

129
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I'm sure you'll understand.

130
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I got electrocuted.

131
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Don't say you got electrocuted.

132
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I got electrocuted.

133
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
With this face.

134
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Then, since it's a live performance today, how do you always say it?

135
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Even me, even Hamada-san.

136
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I got electrocuted.

137
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I didn't want to show it to the general public.

138
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
This guy.

139
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:59,000
At Hamada's wedding, when he said hello, he hit the microphone.

140
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Fuji TV is so quiet.

141
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
That's not Nerotan.

142
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
He hit the microphone.

143
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Speaking of Matsumoto-san's hobby,

144
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
It's watching adult videos.

145
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
This video title is...

146
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Oki-san, isn't it good?

147
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Chome-chome-chome-chome.

148
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
What is this chome-chome-chome-chome?

149
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Yes, Hamada-san.

150
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Oki-san, isn't it good?

151
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
You're wet, aren't you?

152
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I see.

153
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
It's not about being wet or not being wet.

154
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Just like that!

155
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
You know, in the quiz, you're pulling the audience.

156
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
You're completely pulling them.

157
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Next.

158
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Yes.

159
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Oki-san, isn't it good? I'm wet, aren't I?

160
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
That's enough.

161
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
You're pulling the audience.

162
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Oki-san.

163
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
You're mean.

164
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
If you say something like that, it's not mean.

165
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
There aren't many girls, so you shouldn't say something like that.

166
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
That's a good story.

167
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Next.

168
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Oki-san, isn't it good?

169
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I'm f***ing crazy.

170
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Hello, hello.

171
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
It's really...

172
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
You're doing well today.

173
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I'm doing well today.

174
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
How do I say this?

175
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
It depends on the situation, so it's difficult.

176
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
That's right.

177
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
It depends on the situation, so it's difficult.

178
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
My face is facing this way, but...

179
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
It's like this.

180
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
That's right.

181
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Women are like that.

182
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
They're like that.

183
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I thought they were laughing until now, but suddenly they have energy.

184
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
But...

185
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
They're like that.

186
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
That's right.

187
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Women are like that.

188
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Men are like that when they're excited.

189
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Women are like that until just now.

190
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
What the hell is this?

191
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
It's like the Kikurin of Bebop.

192
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
That's right.

193
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Women are really difficult.

194
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
So I don't know anything about women and the weather in the mountains.

195
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Men have the same personality throughout the year.

196
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
That's not true.

197
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
It's annoying.

198
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
There are days when I'm irritated, right?

199
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I'm not. I'm not.

200
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I'm a talent without a back.

201
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
But my head is a bit of a talent.

202
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Don't say rude things.

203
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I can't laugh or clap.

204
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
What?

205
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
What?

206
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
It's bad when you're in a bad mood.

207
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I'm not in a bad mood.

208
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I'm in a bad mood because I don't care if I'm in a bad mood.

209
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
You...

210
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Don't touch me.

211
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
It hurts. It hurts. It hurts a lot.

212
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
You're weak when you look at your juniors.

213
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Your juniors?

214
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
You're strong.

215
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
You're like this.

216
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,000
You're good at using your lower body.

217
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I've never used my lower body.

218
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Where are you going?

219
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Come closer.

220
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Do you know how much your juniors hate you?

221
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
What are you talking about?

222
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
There's a junior called Higashino.

223
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,000
He's a good kid.

224
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Who are you going to hook up with?

225
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Who?

226
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
What?

227
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
When are you going to hook up with him?

228
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
You're going to the disco and going to the VIP room.

229
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Bring the guy in the red clothes.

230
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
You're still doing it.

231
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
You're still doing it.

232
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Don't listen to what he says and what I say.

233
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,000
It's me, right?

234
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Look at me.

235
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Look at my face.

236
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
You said it yourself.

237
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I didn't say anything.

238
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Let's forget about that.

239
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
What are you talking about?

240
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
What do you think of me?

241
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
That's right.

242
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Higashino is 10 minutes late.

243
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
He's the same age as Kondo.

244
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
He's 10 minutes late.

245
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Everyone is late, especially when they're young.

246
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Why aren't you answering me?

247
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Then he comes and says,

248
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I'm sorry.

249
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:27,000
He catches a junior who says he's sorry.

250
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
This is a fairy tale.

251
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
You.

252
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I did it for you.

253
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,000
And humans are...

254
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I think you'll understand if you're a little soft-hearted.

255
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
You're a soft-hearted man.

256
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
You're a judoka.

257
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:52,000
You're a little...

258
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
If you think you're going to get hit, don't tighten your abs.

259
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Humans are like that.

260
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
You get hit a little and you're like that.

261
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
But if you let your guard down, you'll get hit.

262
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
It's like you're working out.

263
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
The day I came with this guy,

264
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I kicked him like this.

265
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
My muscles were loose, so I kicked him.

266
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
This time difference attack.

267
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
They both got hit in the face.

268
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
No, that's a dangerous story.

269
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I did it for you.

270
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I was late the day before.

271
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I was late for two days in a row.

272
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
That's right.

273
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Those two are the kids you care about.

274
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
If you get angry,

275
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I can't go to play like I always do.

276
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
If you get angry at someone you care about.

277
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000
That's why I've been late for two days in a row.

278
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I don't want you to get hurt.

279
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
What the hell are you guys doing?

280
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Bang!

281
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Do you know Hanako Yamada?

282
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Wait a minute.

283
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
That's not what I meant.

284
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Tell me if that's what you did.

285
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Hanako Yamada.

286
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
She had a wonderful dream.

287
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
She was on TV on Sunday.

288
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
When she came to the pool,

289
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
she couldn't calm down.

290
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
What do you think she did?

291
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
She wrapped herself in a blanket.

292
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Hanako Yamada was like this.

293
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I didn't like that either.

294
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Wait a minute.

295
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:34,000
You had a blanket on your back, too.

296
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I'm a human being.

297
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
So you were having fun at that time.

298
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
You didn't tell me you were on a strike.

299
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I didn't.

300
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I didn't do anything.

301
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I had a reason to do it.

302
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I took her to the back of the mountain in Rokko.

303
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I told her not to do it naked.

304
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I beat her up.

305
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I pulled her leg.

306
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I didn't like that.

307
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Wait a minute.

308
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
You took her to Rokko, but you didn't beat her up.

309
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I didn't beat her up.

310
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I didn't.

311
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I didn't.

312
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Why did you take her to the back of the mountain in Rokko

313
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
and beat her up?

314
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I beat her up.

315
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I beat her up.

316
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I didn't do anything.

317
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
You were training her.

318
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000
What?

319
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
She's a little weak.

320
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
She's a little stubborn.

321
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
She's a little weak.

322
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,000
That's why I beat her up.

323
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,000
What did you do?

324
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
What did you do?

325
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I didn't do anything.

326
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I took her to the back of the mountain in Rokko.

327
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I didn't beat her up.

328
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I didn't do anything.

329
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Do you know Mina?

330
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
What?

331
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
What did you do?

332
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Do you know Mina?

333
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
She's a little girl.

334
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
She's a little girl.

335
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Do you know her?

336
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
She's a little girl.

337
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I beat her up.

338
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Wait.

339
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
That's not it.

340
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,000
That's not it.

341
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,000
You didn't move like that.

342
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Who did that?

343
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
That's what I saw.

344
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
That's what I saw.

345
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I don't know.

346
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I was sitting like this.

347
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I was talking like this.

348
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I was like this.

349
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I was like this.

350
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I was like this.

351
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I lost the game.

352
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
But...

353
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I was wearing a jacket like this.

354
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Right?

355
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I don't know how many people there are.

356
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I was wearing a jacket like this.

357
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Right?

358
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I don't know how many people there are.

359
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
You said 12 people.

360
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Why did it take so long?

361
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I almost said 2 people.

362
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
It's similar.

363
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
12 people and 2 people.

364
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I almost said 2 people.

365
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
It's similar.

366
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
You're just an idiot.

367
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
What?

368
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I don't care about that.

369
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
What?

370
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I don't know women.

371
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
You said something like that.

372
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I can't think of anything.

373
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I can't think of anything.

374
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
It's like this.

375
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
What?

376
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
A poop?

377
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Don't say stupid things.

378
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
You're a kid.

379
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I wanted to say that.

380
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I'm sorry.

381
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
It happens sometimes.

382
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
A young comedian's egg on TV.

383
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
It's not a big deal.

384
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
It's like this.

385
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
A poop?

386
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
It's amazing, right?

387
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
What?

388
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
You're a kid.

389
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
It's amazing, right?

390
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
You're a kid.

391
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
What?

392
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I don't understand.

393
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I don't understand.

394
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
It hurts when your little finger hits the pillar.

395
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
It hurts when your little finger hits the pillar.

396
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
In the corner.

397
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Like this.

398
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
10 times as much as that.

399
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
10 times as much as that.

400
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
More?

401
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
More?

402
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Is that a thumb?

403
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
It's not a thumb.

404
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
What I'm saying is that it hurts.

405
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
What I'm saying is that it hurts.

406
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
It's a little finger, so it's not a thumb.

407
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Let's ask Umekichi.

408
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Women are women, right?

409
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Do you know where your mother hides her napkin?

410
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Do you know where your mother hides her napkin?

411
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
So what?

412
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
You know, so what?

413
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
You can't just take it.

414
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
You can't just take it.

415
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Are you putting the key away?

416
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Bring your notes.

417
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
You're blushing.

418
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
You're blushing.

419
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Are you cold?

420
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
If you're going to read,

421
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
put your fingers and your napkin in the corner.

422
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Put your fingers and your napkin in the corner.

423
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Do you want to introduce her?

424
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Do you want to introduce her?

425
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
I'll introduce her right away.

426
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Komori Toshiko.

427
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Komori Toshiko.

428
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
19 years old.

429
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
19 years old.

430
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000

19 years old.

432
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
19 years old.

433
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
That's enough.

434
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
You can show me later.

435
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Tennis, skiing, golf.

436
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
My hobby is karaoke and diet.

437
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I see.

438
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
My hobby is fortress and physical education.

439
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Thank you very much.

440
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Thank you very much.

441
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
It's time to read.

442
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Let's read this.

443
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Let's read this.

444
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
My mother watches TV.

445
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Oh, there's a bump.

446
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Oh, there's a bump.

447
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Does it look like me?

448
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I'm good at tapping.

449
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Young comedian watching TV.

450
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,000
I'm a comedian.

451
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Let's go to the next place.

452
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Let's go to the next place.

453
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,000
The result of the golf tournament will be announced next week.

454
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
The result of the golf tournament will be announced next week.

455
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Please watch it.

456
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
After that, we'll play a penalty game.

457
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
After that, we'll play a penalty game.

458
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
When should we play a penalty game?

459
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Let's do our best again.

460
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Do not look away.

461
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
I'm trying to do it.

462
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000

464
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Hey, wait a minute.

465
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
I'm not asking you.

466
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
I'll let you know next week.

467
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Next week, it's golf.

469
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000

00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
No, I can't do that.

477
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
He wants to quit golf and get an assassin.

478
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
I don't like it.

479
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
What?

480
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,000
I'll do my best until next week! Goodbye!
