1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
This is the first episode of Chikitsuki Super Cannonball at Gaki no Tsukai!

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Mr. Tanabashi, the cold season is here again.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
But it's okay. This is the last time we're shooting this year.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
What?

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
The last time?

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I've decided that there won't be any more shooting.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
It's the last time.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
So you won't have any more openings until the end of the year?

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I don't think there will be any more shooting until May of next year.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
That's not good.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
It's been a while since we shot outside.

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Yes.

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
It's a big spectacle.

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I see.

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
It's the super cannonball.

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
It's not just us, right?

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Let's start with this person.

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
It's cold.

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
It's cold.

20
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
It's cold.

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
It's cold.

22
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
It's cold.

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Stop saying that.

24
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm not saying that.

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm just saying it's cold.

26
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Let's do our best.

27
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Let's go.

28
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Okay.

29
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Next is this person.

30
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
He had a good reputation.

31
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
What?

32
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
He had a good reputation.

33
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I remember it.

34
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
It's been a long week.

35
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Yeah.

36
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
He looks like someone from a bar.

37
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Maekun.

38
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Maekun.

39
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Let's go.

40
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Next is this person.

41
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
His eyes are dead.

42
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
His eyes are dead.

43
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Do you still have a headache?

44
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Good morning.

45
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Good morning.

46
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,000
This is the back of a crab.

47
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
No matter how you look at it, it's the back of a crab.

48
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
The last one is this person.

49
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Thank you.

50
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Thank you very much.

51
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Thank you very much.

52
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
It's rare to see a person like him.

53
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I was waiting for this person.

54
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Is that so?

55
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
He told me to do this.

56
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I see.

57
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
He told me to do this.

58
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I got it.

59
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
He told me to do this.

60
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Did you have a big mouth like that?

61
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I have a big mouth.

62
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
The last one is this person.

63
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Today, we will race with a special machine.

64
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
If you win, you will get 100,000 yen.

65
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
We will give you a machine.

66
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Let's start with Mr. Mazumoto.

67
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Is that so?

68
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
This is serious.

69
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Let's choose machines one by one.

70
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Mr. Mazumoto's machine is a crane.

71
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Crane.

72
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
This is scary.

73
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Crane.

74
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Can I ride this?

75
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Can I ride this?

76
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
This is Mr. Mazumoto's machine.

77
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Crane.

78
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
This is Mr. Machan's machine.

79
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I will control this machine and win.

80
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
100,000 yen?

81
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Thank you.

82
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
It's okay.

83
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I think it's better.

84
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Yes.

85
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I will continue.

86
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Please win.

87
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Mr. Hamada.

88
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Can you ride this?

89
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
It's a shovel car.

90
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Shovel car.

91
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
This is my machine.

92
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Mr. Hamada has lost the championship.

93
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I can't win.

94
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Last time, Mr. Hamada challenged with a stone shovel.

95
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Next is Mr. Yamazaki.

96
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Mr. Yamazaki's machine is a dump truck.

97
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Dump truck.

98
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I want to drive a dump truck.

99
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
This is Mr. Yamazaki's machine.

100
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Dump truck.

101
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Yamazaki is a speed racer.

102
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
He will win 100,000 yen with a dump truck.

103
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Mr. Hamada's machine is a shovel car.

104
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Shovel car.

105
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Michael Hamada's machine is a pop mix.

106
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Mr. Hamada's machine is a bulldozer.

107
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Mr. Yamazaki challenges with a powerful bulldozer.

108
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Mr. Yamazaki, what are you doing?

109
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I'm doing a bankroll.

110
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Mr. Okamoto is driving the 6th bulldozer.

111
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
The machine is decided.

112
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I'll teach you how to drive the machine.

113
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I don't know how to drive.

114
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Let's see how he will do.

115
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I'm scared.

116
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Are you OK?

117
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I'm OK.

118
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I don't want to fly.

119
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
It's easy.

120
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
You should have told me before.

121
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I can't win in a race.

122
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
It's automatic.

123
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Really?

124
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
There is no gear.

125
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Good.

126
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
This is the parking.

127
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
It's parked now.

128
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Look at this.

129
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
It's parked now.

130
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I'm driving forward.

131
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I'm going straight.

132
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I'm going left.

133
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I see.

134
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I release the brake and accelerate.

135
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I'm going forward.

136
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I got it.

137
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I got it.

138
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I'm going back.

139
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I got it.

140
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I got it.

141
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I got it.

142
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I got it.

143
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I got it.

144
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I got it.

145
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
The lecture is over.

146
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Let's prepare for the race.

147
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Yes.

148
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Can you prepare for the battle?

149
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
No.

150
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Let's do it quickly.

151
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
It's cold.

152
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Everyone is here.

153
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
It's cold.

154
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
It's hard to get into the car.

155
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
My face is swollen.

156
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
There is a goal in front.

157
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Do you see the flag?

158
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
That is the goal.

159
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Let's go.

160
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Cheer for me.

161
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Today's race is cannonball.

162
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Everyone gets on the car.

163
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Who will reach the goal?

164
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Let's see.

165
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Mach-chan is in the lead.

166
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Dump GT is after Mach-chan.

167
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Other cars are slow.

168
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Is it difficult to control?

169
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Is the car too heavy?

170
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Mach-chan is trying to run away.

171
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
He is in the lead.

172
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Let's see it in slow motion.

173
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Yamasaki is in the lead.

174
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Yes.

175
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
How was it?

176
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Yes.

177
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Yes.

178
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I did my best, but I was scared.

179
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Mach-chan is in the lead.

180
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Is he going to reach the goal?

181
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
He is slow.

182
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
He is slow.

183
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I can't see anything.

184
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I can't see anything.

185
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I can see the flag.

186
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
It's now.

187
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I can see the flag, but I can't see the flag.

188
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
It's the flag.

189
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
My face is swollen.

190
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,000
What are you doing?

191
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Calm down.

192
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
What's wrong?

193
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Don't you run?

194
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
You.

195
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
He ran away.

196
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Was it fun?

197
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I enjoyed it.

198
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I was nervous.

199
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I said I would go to the bathroom.

200
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I couldn't go out, so I hid in the bathroom.

201
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I don't like it.

202
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
It's hard.

203
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Who?

204
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
To live.

205
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
It's too late to say that.

206
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
It's not too late to say that.

207
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I think it's hard.

208
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I don't know when I will die.

209
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I don't know when I will die.

210
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
That's right.

211
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
You will die sooner.

212
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Why?

213
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Why?

214
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
You will die sooner.

215
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
You will die sooner.

216
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I don't die.

217
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
You and I have different fans.

218
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Do you understand?

219
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I don't like it.

220
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I don't like it.

221
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I don't understand.

222
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I don't like it.

223
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I don't have many fans.

224
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
We have different ways to support each other.

225
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
What does that have to do with me dying sooner?

226
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
How many fans do you have?

227
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
How many fans do you have?

228
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
That's a lot.

229
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
It's okay.

230
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Let's say 500,000.

231
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
500,000 is a good number.

232
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Let's say 400,000.

233
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
That's a lot.

234
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Let's say 400,000.

235
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
500,000 people...

236
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Let's say 400,000.

237
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Let's live!

238
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Let's live!

239
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Let's live!

240
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:43,000
The power that 40,000 people think of and the power that 40,000 people think of are totally different.

241
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
But you're more dangerous.

242
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Why is that?

243
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Damn it!

244
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Zaka!

245
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Gyo-san should be here.

246
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I'm...

247
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Powerful.

248
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Powerful.

249
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
You have a knife?

250
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Don't cheat on me!

251
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
You know...

252
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
You're not good at sex.

253
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
It feels great!

254
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
It doesn't feel great at all!

255
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
You know...

256
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Are you kidding me?

257
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I don't know, but you're more dangerous.

258
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
You can say whatever you want.

259
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Why are you from the east, west, south, and north?

260
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
There are a lot of places.

261
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
In various places?

262
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
In various places.

263
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
But you don't like the north direction?

264
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
You don't like it anywhere.

265
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
You don't like the north direction?

266
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
In that sense, you're more dangerous.

267
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
No, that's not it.

268
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I've never broken up in a way that I've been hated.

269
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
You know...

270
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Speaking of this,

271
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:58,000
A woman broke up with you for a year, and then with me for a year.

272
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I really want to go out with you for a year and see which one is better.

273
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Everything comes to me.

274
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Why?

275
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Well, I don't know if you're really interested, but...

276
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Is it kindness?

277
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I can only say that.

278
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I'm sorry.

279
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Well, I think...

280
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Why do you think it's me?

281
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
If I had to say...

282
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Aren't you cold?

283
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
No, I'm not cold at all.

284
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Why do you think it's me?

285
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I feel like I'm wrapped up in something.

286
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I feel like I'm wrapped up in something.

287
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I think so.

288
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Thank you very much.

289
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
You don't have to do that.

290
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Yesterday...

291
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
It was an interesting move, wasn't it?

292
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
There's a bar in my neighborhood.

293
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
If you turn left, it's the house.

294
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I tried to turn left,

295
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,000
but there was a guy who looked like a college student with black glasses.

296
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
That's scary.

297
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,000
He was looking at the vending machine.

298
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I turned around and opened the window.

299
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
He looked at the vending machine again.

300
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I wondered what he was looking at.

301
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
It was a condom vending machine.

302
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,000
If there was a vending machine here, it would be standing here.

303
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Why?

304
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
He looked like he didn't know what it was.

305
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
He was a cherry boy.

306
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:56,000
He had never done anything other than study.

307
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
That's scary.

308
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I think he wanted to see what it was like inside.

309
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
It's a big world.

310
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
There are a lot of strange things.

311
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I woke up the other day and laughed.

312
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
It was noisy.

313
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I was sleeping with my earplugs on.

314
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
When I woke up in the morning, I ate my earplugs.

315
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I don't know why I ate my earplugs.

316
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I had earplugs on this side, but I didn't have earplugs on this side, so I ate them.

317
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I don't know why I ate my earplugs.

318
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I don't know why I ate my earplugs.

319
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I don't know why I ate my earplugs.

320
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Take out your earplugs.

321
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Michael Jackson is coming to Japan soon.

322
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Is it true that Matsumoto is close to Michael?

323
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Is it true that he always comes to your house when he comes to Japan?

324
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I've known Michael since I came to Japan.

325
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
How did you meet him?

326
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I went to see his concert.

327
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
That's normal.

328
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
At first it was normal.

329
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I was the first to see his concert.

330
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Michael must have felt something.

331
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Among the tens of thousands of fans, I'm the only one who sees Michael differently.

332
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I know he's a real fan.

333
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I've been watching Michael a lot.

334
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I think Michael understood me.

335
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Since the second half, Michael has been like this in front of me.

336
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Now he comes to my house.

337
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Will he come again this time?

338
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I think so.

339
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
What are you doing at home?

340
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,000
He often helps me with various things.

341
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
What?

342
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:04,000
For example, if I have a plate, I carry a dry towel next to it.

343
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
He's a good guy.

344
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:11,000
If I do this at the table, Michael will bring it to me.

345
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Michael is amazing.

346
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
He brings the table like this.

347
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
He can go like this.

348
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Michael turns around once.

349
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,000
He can't turn around immediately.

350
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Michael knows that.

351
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:34,000
He turns around once.

352
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I think Michael is amazing.

353
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
That's amazing.

354
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Michael and Michael have similar emotions.

355
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
He's a good guy.

356
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
He laughs the same way.

357
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Why doesn't he know you're laughing?

358
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:58,000
When I put the miso soup on the table, he sometimes moves like this.

359
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Michael and I laugh together.

360
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
He laughs like this.

361
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I'm scared.

362
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:19,000
He is a famous climber.

363
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Climber?

364
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Yes.

365
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:27,000
What should I do to prevent me from falling asleep in the mountains?

366
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
You can do this in the snowy mountains.

367
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
You sound like Mr. Sai.

368
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:45,000
You can do this in the snowy mountains.

369
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Climbing has nothing to do with climbing.

370
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Do you know why you can't sleep?

371
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Why do I die when I sleep?

372
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,000
When you're awake, you release your heat.

373
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
But when you fall asleep, your heat decreases.

374
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
You can't stand the cold and die.

375
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Should I have been more stupid?

376
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I'm not stupid.

377
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
That's enough.

378
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Are you waiting for something?

379
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Of course.

380
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I'm starting to walk in search of that light.

381
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,000
But it's also true that I'm losing sight of that light.

382
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Good luck.

383
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Thank you.

384
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:35,000
A climber is a devil.

385
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Yes.

386
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
In the snowy mountains.

387
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Yes.

388
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
That's it.

389
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Something like that.

390
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
What do you mean?

391
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
What do you mean?

392
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
To prevent me from falling asleep.

393
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Is there a night when you can't fall asleep?

394
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
There are some nights when I can't fall asleep.

395
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:59,000
There are nights when you can't fall asleep.

396
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Yes, there are.

397
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,000
There's no rain that doesn't stop.

398
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
There's no rain that doesn't stop.

399
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
There's no night that doesn't open.

400
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I don't care about that.

401
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:19,000
I don't know if it feels good to say that.

402
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I don't care about your feelings.

403
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
It's fine, right?

404
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
I'll tell you.

405
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I'll tell you.

406
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
The opposite is true.

407
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Yes.

408
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:36,000
When you can't sleep, you often count sheep in your head.

409
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
I used to say that.

410
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
One sheep, two sheep.

411
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
If you do this, you'll fall asleep.

412
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Do the opposite.

413
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
What do you mean?

414
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
What?

415
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
That dance.

416
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Teach me.

417
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
No, no, no, no, no.

418
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Hurry up and walk to the light.

419
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
You're weird.

420
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
What is it?

421
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
What is it?

422
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
I can't help it.

423
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
What is it?

424
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
You're really weird.

425
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Your pelvis is funny.

426
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
That's the funniest thing today.

427
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Your pelvis is funny.

428
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:31,000
You're good at moving.

429
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
This Christmas.

430
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I want to give you a present.

431
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:43,000
What would you give me?

432
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Tell me.

433
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:50,000
I'm a fan of you.

434
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,000
What I want is candy.

435
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Sweet candy.

436
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Please give me candy.

437
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Let me tell you the truth.

438
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
I'm a fan of you.

439
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,000
I'm a fan of you everywhere.

440
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
That's right.

441
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I'm a fan of you everywhere.

442
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
What I want is a cotton ball.

443
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,000
That's right.

444
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:26,000
I use it when we go camping together.

445
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Mr. Nishin.

446
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Mr. Toyota.

447
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Mr. Nishin.

448
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Nice to meet you.

449
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Mr. Nishin.

450
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
He gave me a sleeping bag.

451
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:42,000
He gave me a sleeping bag for yakisoba.

452
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Thank you very much.

453
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Mr. Hisamitsu.

454
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
He gave me a sleeping bag in a box.

455
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Thank you very much.

456
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Mr. Hisamitsu gave me a sleeping bag.

457
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Thank you very much.

458
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
You're welcome.

459
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
There are so many.

460
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Do you have anything else?

461
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:16,000
I don't have anything else.

462
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Good luck.

463
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,000
What is the name of the coat I'm wearing?

464
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
It's Coca-Cola.

465
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Coca-Cola?

466
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Mr. Coca-cola.

467
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
By the way, we were doing Zotto.

468
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
We're not strangers.

469
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
And the boss is cool.

470
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
He's cute.

471
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
We're totally compatible.

472
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
All in all, thank you to everyone at the company.

473
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Is that so?

474
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Yes.

475
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Next time you go to Seikan, please take care of the service.

476
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Why didn't I lower my head?

477
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Why didn't I lower my head for you?

478
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Don't say it for you.
