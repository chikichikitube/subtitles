1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Let's go

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I can hear the sound

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Here it comes

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
What's going on with the set?

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Here it comes

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I can't listen to this

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Let's take a look

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Good evening everyone

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I'm Akira from Nantan

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Today is the first day of the new year

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
We had a lot of talk

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
We did a lot of things

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Why is it like this today?

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Why are you here?

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Where is that guy with the black face?

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Where is that guy?

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
He has a bad complexion

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I heard he has a stomachache

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
You're bothering me again

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Let's take a look

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
First of all, what Matsumoto predicted

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
What?

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I saw this

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm sorry but let's take a look

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
First of all, what Matsumoto predicted

26
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
The person watching you on TV said

27
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Matsumoto is amazing

28
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Stop it

29
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
There are a lot of people like that

30
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Wait a minute

31
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Matsumoto is praising you

32
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I talked to you in a talk last year

33
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
It was perfect

34
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I...

35
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
What is it?

36
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I don't know what you're talking about

37
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I talked about a lot of other things

38
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Why did you suddenly become energetic?

39
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Let's take a look

40
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
What Matsumoto predicted

41
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Let's take a look

42
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Let me tell you a story

43
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Stop being angry

44
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
What are you talking about?

45
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Who would be happy about that?

46
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I was happy when I was eating cup noodles

47
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
50 years

48
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Matsumoto predicted

49
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Today's event is over

50
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
A part of Tokyo Harajuku's pedestrian heaven

51
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
has been systematically destroyed

52
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
due to the noise and traffic jam of the rock band

53
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
A year ago

54
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Matsumoto predicted the lack of glasses

55
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
What was the result?

56
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
What will happen this year?

57
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
There will be a huge planet on Earth

58
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
A huge planet

59
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
It will rise

60
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Australia on Earth

61
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Gung Gung Gung

62
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
This program was brought to you by the sponsor

63
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:46,000
10 minutes of this program will make you think of it as a meteor

64
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,000
This talk is based on Jimmy, who is retiring from the entertainment industry

65
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I don't think there's anyone who can beat him

66
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
In that field

67
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
There's no one who can beat him

68
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Well, I can't beat Jimmy

69
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I can't beat him

70
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
He will go

71
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
That's right

72
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
And this program was born

73
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Jimmy Onishi

74
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
His real name is Onishi Hideaki

75
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
He is a unique character in Japan's comedy world

76
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
His love for comedy

77
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
continues to give us peace and dreams

78
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
That Jimmy is now saying goodbye to us

79
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
He is about to leave for America

80
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,000
This is a great miracle of a comedian

81
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Let's see the main character of the day

82
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Please

83
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
It's a gorilla

84
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
It's a gorilla

85
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
What is it?

86
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Today is the day of departure

87
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I told you to look forward to it

88
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I said it earlier

89
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
You don't have a show to say goodbye to Jimmy?

90
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Not at all

91
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
You don't have one?

92
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I'm laughing

93
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
The story of memories is getting more exciting

94
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
It's finally time for Jimmy to leave

95
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I'll give you a bouquet

96
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
It's time for Jimmy to leave

97
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Thank you very much

98
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Thank you very much

99
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Thank you very much

100
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
It's finally time to leave

101
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Virgin Road

102
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I want you to leave

103
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Take care and go to America

104
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Thank you very much

105
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
See you again

106
00:05:37,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Thank you very much

107
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I knew something like this would happen

108
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Are you okay?

109
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Why didn't you do this until the end?

110
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
This is the story of a certain incident that Machan experienced

111
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Actually, the other day

112
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
When I went to the coffee shop

113
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I wanted to order iced coffee

114
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
It was a little strange

115
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Did you bite it?

116
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I said it was delicious

117
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,000
But I couldn't bring it

118
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Iced coffee

119
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
That's where this project was born

120
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Where is the ice coffee?

121
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I'm going to the limit of iced coffee

122
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
First of all, Yamazaki will test the limits of iced coffee

123
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Iced coffee

124
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Do you think you're serious?

125
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I'm sorry

126
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I'm going to change clothes

127
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I'm going to go higher

128
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Will you go higher?

129
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I'll go to the last stage

130
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Oyan Fui Fui

131
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
This is definitely

132
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I can't go to Oyan Fui Fui

133
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
And I can't find out

134
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I don't know

135
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I want cream soda

136
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Oyan Fui Fui

137
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I'm sorry

138
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Oyan Fui Fui

139
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Oyan Fui Fui

140
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Please order

141
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Oyan Fui Fui

142
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Oyan Fui Fui

143
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Oyan Fui Fui

144
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Iced coffee

145
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Did you say it?

146
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Did you say it clearly?

147
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
What is this?

148
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Oyan iced coffee

149
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I was crying

150
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I was crying at the end

151
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
But Matsu-chan didn't get tired of the limit of iced coffee

152
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Iced coffee

153
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
What do you call it?

154
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Iced coffee

155
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Iced coffee

156
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
It's a Chinese dish

157
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
It's hot

158
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Please forgive me

159
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
It's hot

160
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I don't need anything hot

161
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Chinese food

162
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
And again, the limit investigation begins

163
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
The second time, I'm not a kid

164
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
How far is Chinese food?

165
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I'm going to the limit of Chinese food

166
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Thank you very much

167
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
To find out the limit of Chinese food

168
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I sent Yamazaki, a market investigator, again

169
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:19,000
The second time, I'm a market investigator

170
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:27,000
The third time, I'm a market investigator

171
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:34,000
The fourth time, I'm a market investigator

172
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,000
The fifth time, I'm a market investigator

173
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Let's go to the limit of the time

174
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Mr. Suzuki

175
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Today too

176
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
It's time to change clothes

177
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Again?

178
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
It can't be helped

179
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Are you going to cry?

180
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I won't cry today

181
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Change your clothes

182
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
It's perfect

183
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
What's perfect?

184
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Excuse me

185
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Yes

186
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Well

187
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Well

188
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Miso ramen

189
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Here you are

190
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Well

191
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Well

192
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Mr. Suzuki

193
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Mr. Suzuki

194
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Mr. Suzuki

195
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Well

196
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Suikyouka

197
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Four

198
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Suikyouka

199
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Well

200
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Suikyouka

201
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Suikyouza

202
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Suikyouza

203
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Suikyouza

204
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Suikyouza

205
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
What is this?

206
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Suikyouza

207
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Suikyouza

208
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Well

209
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Chinese cold noodles

210
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Cold noodles

211
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Well

212
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Well

213
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Well

214
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Well

215
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Well

216
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Well

217
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Well

218
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Well

219
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
It's a big one

220
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
It's a big one

221
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Chinese cold noodles

222
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Well

223
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Well

224
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I'll take this

225
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
What?

226
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
There was a food called Suikyouza

227
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Well

228
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I won't take it anymore

229
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I cried again

230
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
In the letter of the question

231
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
He found that it was actually a mountain climbing tool

232
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
So

233
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
He gave the mountain climbing goods that look like tools

234
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
To the beginner Hama

235
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I want to go to Tateyama

236
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
It's Tateyama at this time

237
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
It was strange

238
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
It's Tateyama

239
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
And then

240
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Manager

241
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Why are you calling me manager?

242
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I climb because it's hard to climb

243
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
It doesn't matter where you climb

244
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
The mountain is good

245
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
This is about 15 seconds

246
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
And Hama went to buy the goods

247
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Broken Thunder

248
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
How far is the Broken Thunder?

249
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
How far is it?

250
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Do you understand?

251
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I'm going to buy mountain climbing goods

252
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
It's exciting today

253
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
It's not exciting at all

254
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
It's dangerous when you fall from the mountain

255
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
It's like a sponge

256
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
It's like a sponge

257
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
But it's plastic

258
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
And Machan

259
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
The mountain climbing goods were lectured

260
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I'm fine

261
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I'm going to climb the mountain

262
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I'm going to go with this foot

263
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
As a feeling

264
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I understand

265
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Shall we go?

266
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
The mountain is good

267
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Rock climbing

268
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
The mountain is good

269
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Please

270
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
The mountain is good

271
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I want to go to Tateyama

272
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I want to go to Tateyama

273
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I want to go to Tateyama

274
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
At this time

275
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I want to go to Tateyama

276
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Don't laugh

277
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Don't call the manager

278
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Manager

279
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Are you the manager?

280
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
No

281
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I went to the exhibition

282
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
You know about the mountain, right?

283
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Well

284
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I want to climb Tateyama

285
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
I want to climb in front of the station

286
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Tateyama Station

287
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Tateyama Station

288
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
What?

289
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Tateyama Station

290
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Well

291
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
It seems that the mountain is good

292
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
That's right

293
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Well

294
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
It's better to be away

295
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
A little away

296
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Look at various things

297
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Look at various things

298
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
The mountain is good

299
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Jopper

300
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Well

301
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Can you give me a jopper?

302
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Jopper

303
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Well

304
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Please give me a dango

305
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Please give me a dango

306
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Please give me a dango

307
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Excuse me

308
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Please give me a dango

309
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Please give me a dango

310
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Please give me a dango

311
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Laugh

312
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Laugh

313
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Laugh

314
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Look

315
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
It's a cushion

316
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
It's a cushion

317
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Put it on your shoulder

318
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
That's a jopper

319
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Jopper

320
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
The mountain is good

321
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Laugh

322
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Laugh

323
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Laugh

324
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Laugh

325
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
The mountain is good

326
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Laugh

327
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Laugh

328
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Laugh

329
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Laugh

330
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Laugh

331
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
As if he understood something

332
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Machan suddenly started talking about this

333
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
It's hard

334
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Laugh

335
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Laugh

336
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Who?

337
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
To live

338
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
It's too late to say

339
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Laugh

340
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
It's not too late to say

341
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I think it's really hard

342
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I don't know when I'll die

343
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Laugh

344
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Well

345
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
You don't know when you'll die

346
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
That's right

347
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,000
That's how this opening was born

348
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
The first prank

349
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
The prank

350
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Nakamura died

351
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Nakamura died

352
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Good evening

353
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Today

354
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
I'm going to prank Yamasaki

355
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I'm used to being pranked

356
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I'm careful

357
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
That's right

358
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I thought about it

359
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Nakamura

360
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
He died

361
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
He's going to die

362
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
In my opinion

363
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
He's dead

364
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Laugh

365
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
First of all

366
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Let's call the actor

367
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Laugh

368
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Laugh

369
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Laugh

370
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
It's scary

371
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Laugh

372
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Let's give Nakamura a spot

373
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
It's not the most plain place

374
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Laugh

375
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Even if you die

376
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Actually this time

377
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
The prank has already been done since last week

378
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Nakamura approached Yamasaki unexpectedly

379
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Yamasaki, who won the opening cannonball race

380
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I promise to give you 100,000 yen next week

381
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I'm going to die next week

382
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
The last conversation with myself

383
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I had an impression on Yamasaki

384
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Laugh

385
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Nakamura, who was supposed to die in a traffic accident

386
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Appear on the back seat of the car

387
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Will Yamasaki be able to withstand the fear?

388
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
It was hot

389
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Laugh

390
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Laugh

391
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Laugh

392
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
He is empty

393
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I'm going to end the talk

394
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Laugh

395
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Laugh

396
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Laugh

397
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I do not think so

398
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
What?

399
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
What about you, Sano?

400
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I can talk to her.

401
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
I'll be right there.

402
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Really?

403
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Is it today?

404
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Yes, today.

405
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Tomorrow, the day after, or the day after tomorrow.

406
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
What about you, Okamoto?

407
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
I'll be right there.

408
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
I'll be right there.

409
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
I'll be right there.

410
00:20:51,000 --> 00:21:10,000
I'll be right there.

411
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Thank you for your hard work.

412
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:46,000
I'll be right there.

413
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
I'll be right there.

414
00:21:49,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I'll be right there.

415
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:19,000
I'll be right there.

416
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I'll be right there.

417
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:29,000
I'll be right there.

418
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I'll be right there.

419
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:03,000
I'll be right there.

420
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,000
I'll be right there.

421
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
I'll be right there.

422
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
What's wrong?

423
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
What's wrong?

424
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Don't cry.

425
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
I don't know what's going on.

426
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:24,000
What's wrong?

427
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Did you have 100,000 yen last week?

428
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
You had 100,000 yen last week, didn't you?

429
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
You were worried about that, weren't you?

430
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
You've been saying that all the time, haven't you?

431
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
What happened to your 100,000 yen last week?

432
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:44,000
That's not good.

433
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
What's wrong?

434
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:51,000
That's not good.

435
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:56,000
I'm scared.

436
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
We're still in the middle of the show.

437
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
How was it?

438
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
We've seen it.

439
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
How was it?

440
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
This is the first time in the new year.

441
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
This is the second time in the new year.

442
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Next week is amazing.

443
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Next week is amazing.

444
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
You'll see it this week.

445
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Please watch it next week.

446
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:43,000
It's a masterpiece.
