1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
You're under arrest for defamation.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,000
In the last two trials, even though he was sentenced to life imprisonment, he never showed any signs of remorse.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:26,000
In the last trial, many evidences were presented, and it became clear that he was a liar and a pervert.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
It was also revealed that his words caused a lot of trouble to the people around him.

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
What was the verdict given there?

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
The verdict is the punishment of the Human Breaker!

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:50,000
This program is brought to you by the following sponsors.

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
This program is brought to you by the following sponsors.

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:10,000
At midnight, in a classroom where only one light is on, Kei comes down to this place. Will he be able to withstand this terror?

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Kei-pou, the punishment of the Human Breaker, starts!

12
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The light is on over there.

13
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The classroom is in that room.

14
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:30,000
There was an iron bar in the classroom, and he fell down in five minutes.

15
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The light in the classroom went out in a flash.

16
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
It was so dark.

17
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
It was so dark.

18
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
We were scared, too.

19
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
It was so dark.

20
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
We were scared, too.

21
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
The staff was worried that he would jump out of the window.

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
He almost fell down.

23
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Kei-pou.

24
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Kei-pou.

25
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Ouch!

26
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
No, no.

27
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I just read his name.

28
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Kei-pou.

29
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Yes.

30
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Are you ready?

31
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I'm scared.

32
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
You're not scared of anything yet.

33
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
It's still bright.

34
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
You just have to do your best.

35
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
It's only five minutes.

36
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I'm scared.

37
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Can someone come here?

38
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
You just have to do your best for five minutes.

39
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I'll wait here.

40
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I'm so scared that I can't move.

41
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I can see you, so I know.

42
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
You just have to do your best for five minutes.

43
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Five minutes?

44
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Yes, that's right.

45
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Can someone come here to help me?

46
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
What are you talking about?

47
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
What are you scared of?

48
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
It's a bright classroom.

49
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
You just have to do your best for five minutes.

50
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Yes.

51
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
What?

52
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Kei-pou, stand by.

53
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
He stood up.

54
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I'm scared.

55
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
What's going on?

56
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
What's going on with five minutes?

57
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
It's a delicate time.

58
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
It's a delicate time.

59
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Kei-pou, let's go.

60
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Are you ready?

61
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Yes.

62
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Human breaker.

63
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Ready.

64
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Start.

65
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I'm scared.

66
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Help me.

67
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I'm scared.

68
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
No.

69
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
It hurts.

70
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
It hurts.

71
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I'm scared.

72
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
No.

73
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
No.

74
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
No.

75
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I'm scared.

76
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I'm scared.

77
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
No.

78
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Someone is coming.

79
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Watch out.

80
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Watch out.

81
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Watch out.

82
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Watch out.

83
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
It's not even 30 seconds.

84
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
No.

85
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
No.

86
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Help me.

87
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I'm scared.

88
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
No.

89
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
No.

90
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
No.

91
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
No.

92
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
No.

93
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
No.

94
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I'm scared.

95
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
No.

96
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Help me.

97
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Where can I hold this?

98
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Where can I hold this?

99
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I wonder if there is a person who can hold this.

100
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
It's not in the picture.

101
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
No.

102
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
No.

103
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Someone is coming.

104
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Someone is coming.

105
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I'm scared.

106
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I'm scared.

107
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
No.

108
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
No.

109
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
No.

110
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
No.

111
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I'm scared.

112
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
No.

113
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Someone is coming.

114
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Watch out.

115
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Watch out.

116
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I'm scared.

117
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
No.

118
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
No.

119
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Watch out!

120
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Watch out!

121
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I'm coming!

122
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Where?

123
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
HEPPO!

124
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
HEPPO!

125
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
It's not scary at all!

126
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
It's scary!

127
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Look at this!

128
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
What is it?

129
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
It hurts!

130
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
You're taking a lot of time.

131
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
There's a ghost here!

132
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
There's a ghost here!

133
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
There's no ghost here.

134
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I'm not coming.

135
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Where is the ghost?

136
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
When I look at the viewers,

137
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I feel like I'm being bullied.

138
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I feel like I'm being bullied.

139
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
It's not scary at all.

140
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
It's not scary at all.

141
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
It's not scary at all.

142
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
It's scary.

143
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
If it's this scary, take off your glasses.

144
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
You're trying to look good, aren't you?

145
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
If it's like this,

146
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I won't be forgiven.

147
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
You're going to regret it?

148
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
You have to think about

149
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
how to overcome the fear of HEPPO.

150
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
You have to think about it.

151
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
If you think about it, it'll be scary.

152
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
If you think about it, it'll be scary.

153
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Why are you doing this?

154
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
What are you doing?

155
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Let's end this together.

156
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
It's not scary at all!

157
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
It's not scary at all!

158
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
It's not scary at all!

159
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
It's scary!

160
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Hang in there!

161
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
What are you doing?

162
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Don't stand up!

163
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I'm scared of the skeleton.

164
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I'm scared of the skeleton.

165
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
He said it clearly.

166
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I'm scared of the skeleton.

167
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Are you Summers?

168
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Let's go!

169
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:18,000
After this, Ichidou cooperates to get rid of the fear of Heipou.

170
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Please go with me.

171
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
What if I turn off the light here?

172
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
What is this?

173
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Please, my heart hurts.

174
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I'm scared of the skeleton.

175
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I'm scared of the skeleton.

176
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I can't go to such a place.

177
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Let's go together.

178
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I can't go alone.

179
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
This is scary.

180
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
It's coming out.

181
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
He ran away.

182
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
He ran away.

183
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I'm scared.

184
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
He's coming out.

185
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
He ran away.

186
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
It hurts.

187
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I'm scared.

188
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I'm scared.

189
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I'm scared.

190
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I'm scared.

191
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
It's really scary.

192
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Why are you wearing glasses?

193
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Why are you wearing glasses?

194
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
You can't take it off.

195
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
It's really scary.

196
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I'm scared.

197
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I'm scared.

198
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
There was something.

199
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I can overcome this.

200
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I can overcome this.

201
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
You don't have to.

202
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Stand on the wall over there and go home.

203
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I don't want to.

204
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I don't want to.

205
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I'm scared.

206
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Why are you scared?

207
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Why are you scared of the floor?

208
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Are you scared of the floor?

209
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I'm scared.

210
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
If you don't have a floor, you're more scared.

211
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I'm glad.

212
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I can't help it.

213
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I can't help it.

214
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I'm scared.

215
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
What should we do?

216
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
What should we do?

217
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
It's over for today.

218
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I'll think about it next time.

219
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I'll think about it next time.

220
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
How did you feel when you found out about Matsumoto's abandoned inn?

221
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
How did you feel when you found out about Matsumoto's abandoned inn?

222
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I'm going to die.

223
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I'm going to die.

224
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I'm scared of the floor.

225
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Look at the floor.

226
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I'm scared of the floor.

227
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
What is it?

228
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
It's a tiger's eye.

229
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
It's not a tiger's eye.

230
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
It's a tiger's eye.

231
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
It's a tiger's eye.

232
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
It's not a tiger's eye.

233
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
It's a tiger's eye.

234
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
It's a tiger's eye.

235
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I'm scared.

236
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Help me.

237
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Help me.

238
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I'm scared.

239
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I can't help it.

240
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I'm scared.

241
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I'm scared.

242
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I'm scared.

243
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I'm scared!

244
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
What kind of voice is that?

245
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Help me!

246
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Hello!

247
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
How are you feeling?

248
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I'm fine.

249
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Really?

250
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Not at all.

251
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I'm fine too, but there was a funny guy on the way here.

252
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
The old man who was riding his bike.

253
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
He was screaming like this.

254
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
It was serious.

255
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:16,000
He was riding his bike and screaming like this.

256
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I don't know if that's true.

257
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
He was screaming like this.

258
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
He was going fast.

259
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
He was going fast.

260
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
He was going fast.

261
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I feel sorry for him.

262
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
It seems like he's having a hard time.

263
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
He's a terrible person.

264
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
He's a terrible person.

265
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I don't understand it at all.

266
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
He was crying, right?

267
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
He was crying, right?

268
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
What the hell are you guys doing?

269
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
What the hell are you guys doing?

270
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
There are people who cry.

271
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
There are people who sneeze.

272
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
There are people who sneeze.

273
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
There are people who say they feel bad.

274
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I don't feel bad.

275
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I don't feel bad.

276
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I didn't mean to say that.

277
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
But I don't know if he'll come suddenly.

278
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
It doesn't matter if he doesn't come every year.

279
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Maybe he'll come this year.

280
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
But I'm a little pissed off.

281
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
We're a duo.

282
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
It's better to have a lot of experiences.

283
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Yes.

284
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Right?

285
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
When I came out here,

286
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
If you say you've never had a pollen allergy,

287
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
It's over, isn't it?

288
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
That's right.

289
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Right?

290
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Which means,

291
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
It's better to have a strong pollen allergy.

292
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
The story gets more exciting.

293
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Well, in a sense.

294
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
In a sense.

295
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
That's why I'm going into the main subject.

296
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I'll do my best next week.

297
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I don't know if I'll be able to do it.

298
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I'll try to climb the tree.

299
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
From the tree to the tree.

300
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
You can't do your job.

301
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
If you think it's true.

302
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
It's fun, isn't it?

303
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
It's better to have a strong pollen allergy.

304
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I don't want you to stay.

305
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
But in terms of pattern,

306
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
It's more interesting if you stay.

307
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I don't know that pattern.

308
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
What's that pattern?

309
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
There's no meaning to being healthy.

310
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I've been wanting to say this for a long time.

311
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I've been wanting to say this since the third time I was a kid.

312
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
How many years ago?

313
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I don't know the meaning of being healthy.

314
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
So I think you should just die.

315
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
But even if you die suddenly,

316
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
There's a schedule.

317
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I don't want to die in a hospital.

318
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
So if you stay for about a month or two,

319
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
It's okay, isn't it?

320
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I can't do that.

321
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Why not?

322
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I can't.

323
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Why not?

324
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I can't do that.

325
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
You have to be careful.

326
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
What do you mean?

327
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
You have to be careful.

328
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Even if I'm careful,

329
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
There's no one who can do it.

330
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
You're the only one who can do it.

331
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
You're the only one who can do it.

332
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
You're the only one who can do it.

333
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I have a bad mouth.

334
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I don't have a bad voice.

335
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I'm doing it with that kind of character.

336
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I'm not saying it seriously.

337
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
That kind of thing.

338
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
But that kind of thing...

339
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Shut up.

340
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I don't want to hear it anymore.

341
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
That kind of thing.

342
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Yes, really.

343
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Then take it out.

344
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Pen name, Shoshinmon-san.

345
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
This is a question for Matsumoto-san,

346
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Who likes parties the most in the entertainment world.

347
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
In Yoshimoto Kogyo,

348
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
It's said to be the most grand party.

349
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
At the birthday party of Nishikawa Helen-san,

350
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
What kind of things do you do?

351
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I went there about 4 years ago.

352
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Helen was 72 years old.

353
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
You'll get scolded.

354
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Sorry, I'm still young.

355
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
When I was about 50 years old.

356
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Oh, really?

357
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Yes, I went there.

358
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
What kind of men are you wearing?

359
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
That's...

360
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I think it's about you.

361
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I didn't wear it in Yoshimoto.

362
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
You're lying.

363
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
No, really, really.

364
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I didn't wear it as much as you and Master Kinji.

365
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
After that, I didn't wear it at all.

366
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
You don't have to go there.

367
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I'll go alone.

368
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
But, after all, there...

369
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:07,000
He's a strong man who is willing to do anything for his family.

370
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
That's amazing.

371
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
On the contrary, I have to celebrate it.

372
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
The way they welcome me is amazing.

373
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I've been coming from Shin-Osaka.

374
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I said I'd be there.

375
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
When the Shinkansen started to run,

376
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Helen was naked on her upper body.

377
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
What?

378
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I don't understand the meaning of being naked.

379
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Why are you naked?

380
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
It was amazing.

381
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
That was what I was hoping for.

382
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I don't understand the meaning of it.

383
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
The K-Bow was like...

384
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
The K-Bow was like this.

385
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
The Shinkansen was going like this.

386
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:49,000
It was going this far.

387
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
It went down a little.

388
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I was in the 9th car.

389
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I was going down.

390
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I was going to go home.

391
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I was going to go to Nishikawa's house.

392
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I was going to go to Mino's house in Kiyosu's car.

393
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Helen was going to run.

394
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,000
She was wearing a bonnet.

395
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
It was a secret service.

396
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
That's right.

397
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I wanted to know what she was going to do at her birthday party.

398
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
At Nishikawa's house.

399
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:28,000
There were all kinds of food in the world.

400
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
That's amazing.

401
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
It was amazing.

402
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I don't know what it was.

403
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
It was about 120 square meters.

404
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
It was in the bedroom.

405
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
It was in the living room.

406
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
The living room was 9 square meters.

407
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I was waiting for you to put the bed.

408
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
It was about 120 square meters.

409
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
There was a map of the world.

410
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
There was food there.

411
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
From that country?

412
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
It was a little different.

413
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
What's different?

414
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:06,000
There was a toothpick growing in the middle.

415
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
You're so stupid.

416
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
You're so stupid.

417
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,000
There were all kinds of food in the world.

418
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
But there was a toothpick.

419
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
There was only one toothpick.

420
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
If you ate it too much...

421
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
You wouldn't be able to use it.

422
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
You wouldn't be able to eat it.

423
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
You have to eat it with a firm feeling.

424
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,000
There was also a hard one.

425
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
That's not how you feel.

426
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,000
You have to eat something soft.

427
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:47,000
There was a party in the living room.

428
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,000
It was a fighting game.

429
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Helen vs. poisonous scorpions.

430
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Today, Helen will fight with a poisonous scorpion.

431
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:09,000
No, no, no.

432
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Helen, are you a villager?

433
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
It's your birthday.

434
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Helen, take your time.

435
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I want to do my best.

436
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I'm so happy.

437
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:27,000
If I could get the chicken...

438
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I would invite her.

439
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I would invite her, but she wouldn't come.

440
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
That was...

441
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
That was amazing.

442
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Helen!

443
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Why?

444
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Why?

445
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Helen wins!

446
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
She didn't come.

447
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
You were just playing with the keyboard.

448
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
You don't have any souvenirs.

449
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
That's amazing.

450
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,000
In the end, it's a kiss.

451
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Helen's.

452
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Really.

453
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Helen's...

454
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Who is it?

455
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I want to give her a real kiss.

456
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I don't want to do that either.

457
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:25,000
If I get the chicken, I'll hit her.

458
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Don, don, don.

459
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I'll hit her.

460
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Helen, come here!

461
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Where is Helen?

462
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I love her.

463
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,000
She's in a transparent box.

464
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Matsumoto uses this technique when he thinks she's licking him.

465
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
What is a spiral hurricane?

466
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I rarely use it, but I use it about five times a year.

467
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
When did you use it recently?

468
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
The week before last.

469
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
You used it the week before last?

470
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
I used it the week before last.

471
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:11,000
The guy at the parking lot was doing something funny.

472
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
He was saying, aye, aye, aye, aye.

473
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I was a little annoyed.

474
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Really?

475
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Aye, aye, aye, aye.

476
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
What kind of technique is it? Tell me.

477
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Spiral hurricane.

478
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
I can't do it unless I put it on.

479
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Oh, you put it on?

480
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Yes.

481
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Oh, I see.

482
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
The guy at the parking lot was saying, aye, aye, aye, aye.

483
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
And then?

484
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Hey!

485
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
So I put it on like this.

486
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
I put it on to prepare for the spiral hurricane.

487
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:44,000
At that time, I was like this.

488
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
I was about to come out.

489
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
I was sitting low.

490
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
I was about to come out.

491
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
I was about to come out.

492
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
When I came out, I felt a tingling sensation.

493
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
I felt a tingling sensation.

494
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
You should have done it after that.

495
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I felt a tingling sensation.

496
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
You should have done it after that.

497
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
It's amazing, the spiral hurricane.

498
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
How did it feel?

499
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
What?

500
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
How did it feel?

501
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
It felt like a translucent green color.

502
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
My butt.

503
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
And then?

504
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
What?

505
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
And then?

506
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
What happened?

507
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
It wasn't just a translucent green color.

508
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
It's fine.

509
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
When I came out, I was like this.

510
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
I was facing the old man.

511
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Yes, bang!

512
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Yes, bang!

513
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
What?

514
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,000
A light ball shaped like a rhino.

515
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Yes.

516
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
I was facing the old man.

517
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I was going to Muzo-san.

518
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
There.

519
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:49,000
It's amazing, the old man.

520
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
What?

521
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
What's a light ball shaped like a rhino?

522
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
It's confusing.

523
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,000
There is a lot of information.

524
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
That's fine.

525
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
That's fine.

526
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
If it's like that, it's fine.

527
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:09,000
You can start over from the beginning.

528
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,000
It's strange that it's connected from the part where he says that he's tired.

529
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Or that he's blowing.

530
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
That's a good thing.

531
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Until then, everyone was laughing.

532
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,000
That's why, even though there's that, after that, there's the light of Ishigaya-san.

533
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
You can't tell from there anymore?

534
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Eh?

535
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
You can't tell from there anymore?

536
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
That's a lie. What was that earlier?

537
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:37,000
There was a doubt, right?

538
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
What was it like?

539
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
There was, but...

540
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
That's right.

541
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,000
At the place where it was half-transparent and turned green,

542
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
I knew that the audience was completely separated.

543
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Right?

544
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Right?

545
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
You can't tell at all, right?

546
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Even at that stage?

547
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
What's with that?

548
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
What do you want to do?

549
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
That's how it's been lately.

550
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
That's right.

551
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
What do you want to do at that stage?

552
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,000
You can't tell at all.

553
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
That's right.

554
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
I know that.

555
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
I know that.

556
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
How many times have you failed at that?

557
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
At that time, I couldn't change it.

558
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:21,000
I was wondering if Kiyoshi-san was doing well on the stage.

559
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
And then I got on the stage.

560
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
