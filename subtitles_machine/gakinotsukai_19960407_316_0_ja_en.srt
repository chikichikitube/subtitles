00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Good evening. Today, I would like to ask if my way of speaking really has the spirit of an actor.

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
As you all know, I'm in trouble right now.

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Today, as you all know, I'm shooting a drama called Leave it to Ryoma at IKUTA studio.

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Who the hell are you?

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Get out of here!

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Get out of here!

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Let me go!

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Let me go!

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Even if I go in the middle, will he be able to deal with this Ryoma?

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I used to play the piano in Hong Kong.

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
What's wrong? There was a sound just now.

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
What's wrong?

13
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
It's not a return, but I'd like to give it a try.

14
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Let's go. I'm shooting right now.

15
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I'm going in here.

16
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
This program is brought to you by these sponsors.

17
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Instead of playing the piano, let's play the guitar.

18
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Ryoma, what time do you start shooting?

19
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I start shooting at 8 in the morning.

20
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I'm trying my best.

21
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Don't say that.

22
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
You start shooting at 8 in the morning?

23
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
That's right.

24
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I can't believe it.

25
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
This situation reminds me of a dead body.

26
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Like a pigeon.

27
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
It reminds me of that.

28
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Don't say that.

29
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Don't say that.

30
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:55,000
This program is brought to you by these sponsors.

31
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:02,000
This program is brought to you by these sponsors.

32
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:09,000
This program is brought to you by these sponsors.

33
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Ryoma, wait a minute.

34
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I just remembered something.

35
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
You're not the only one who remembers.

36
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Don't do that.

37
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I know a lot of names.

38
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Wait a minute.

39
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I don't think you're going to say anything when you turn around.

40
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I'm sorry.

41
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I'm sorry.

42
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
This is better.

43
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,000
This part and this part.

44
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Why are you alone in the dark?

45
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Why are you alone in the dark?

46
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Look at me.

47
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Why are you alone in the dark?

48
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Look at me.

49
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
What is it?

50
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
You're back to being a fool again.

51
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
He left.

52
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Are you okay?

53
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
There's a vacation.

54
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
He won't be on the scene.

55
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
He won't be on the scene.

56
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
It's okay if he doesn't.

57
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Call everyone to come out.

58
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I don't know if I can put it in, but I'll ask them to come out.

59
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Please play up to that.

60
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I don't know what he's going to do after that.

61
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I'll call you as soon as I hear it.

62
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I see.

63
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:28,000
You can play up to that.

64
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
It's so quiet.

65
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
It's so quiet.

66
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
It's so quiet.

67
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:58,000
It's so quiet.

68
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Please throw the stand by turn.

69
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Thank you for waiting.

70
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Okay, let's start the show.

71
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Okay, let's start the show.

72
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
10 seconds before the show.

73
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
8, 7, 4.

74
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
5 seconds before the show.

75
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
4, 3, 2.

76
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,000
It's unbelievable that the Kamikiri has become a human.

77
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
You're persistent.

78
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,000
But he tried to kill Katsu-sensei.

79
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Hey, Ansei.

80
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
You...

81
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Hey!

82
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Hey!

83
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Why are you working alone?

84
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Huh?

85
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Hey.

86
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Hey.

87
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Katsu-sensei's father came back again.

88
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Katsu-sensei.

89
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Just a little more.

90
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
This is bad.

91
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
This is bad.

92
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I can't get along with Kisou-san.

93
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
There's something...

94
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
There's something wrong.

95
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
The tea has come in.

96
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Thank you.

97
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Here's your tea.

98
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
No.

99
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
No.

100
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
What are you doing?

101
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
The tea has come in.

102
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
The tea has come in.

103
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Excuse me.

104
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
What's going on?

105
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
What's going on?

106
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
When did you get here?

107
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
What was that scene?

108
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Hey.

109
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Hey.

110
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Hey.

111
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Hey.

112
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
What are you doing?

113
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
The tea has come in.

114
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I was thinking about that scene.

115
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
It's not a good idea to drink tea in the middle of the night.

116
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I wanted to see how Hamada-kun can be a good actor.

117
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I wanted to see how Hamada-kun can be a good actor.

118
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I see.

119
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Did you just do that?

120
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I did.

121
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I didn't know anything about the other cast members.

122
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I didn't know that.

123
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Everyone was surprised.

124
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I think they're worse than Kouha-kun.

125
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
In that sense.

126
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I didn't know there was an old lady who brought tea.

127
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Are you okay?

128
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
This is my first appearance in a drama.

129
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Thank you very much.

130
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I want to show the gala properly.

131
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Kouha-kun gave me 50,000 yen.

132
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
That's good.

133
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I don't have that much money.

134
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Ladies and Gentlemen.

135
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
What?

136
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Congratulations on your first appearance in a drama.

137
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
No, no.

138
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Congratulations.

139
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I suddenly went to Hamada's drama to play.

140
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:20,000
You're wearing a kimono and dressing up as a woman.

141
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I was wondering what kind of face I would make.

142
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I was wondering what kind of face I would make.

143
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
You were just in a daze.

144
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Normally, when you do that, you know the other actors.

145
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
You said, let's just keep Hamada quiet.

146
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
You didn't know that at all, did you?

147
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I didn't know that at all.

148
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
You didn't know the waiting room, did you?

149
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
What is that waiting room?

150
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Everyone doesn't know that.

151
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
So I was really nervous.

152
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I didn't know that I was coming to the show.

153
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
You didn't know that you were coming to the show.

154
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Well, I didn't know that I was coming to the show.

155
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I was told that there was a lot of interruption.

156
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
There was a lot of interruption.

157
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I was told that there was a lot of water.

158
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I was surprised.

159
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
He was recording you walking and something.

160
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Yes, yes.

161
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,000
He said he was going to put you in the drama.

162
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I don't know where it'll come from, but...

163
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Well, I've done a lot of little roles like that, even until now.

164
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Everyone just doesn't know.

165
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
What little roles?

166
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Well, my debut was when I was about 5 years old.

167
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Small roles?

168
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I debuted from small roles.

169
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
What have you been in?

170
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Well, I've been in a lot of things.

171
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Everyone's like, what? You've been in that?

172
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I've been in a lot of things.

173
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
What is it?

174
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Well, the most famous one is still in Man Man.

175
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Man Man?

176
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
It's like a movie or a drama.

177
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I saw your post earlier, and it was already exposed.

178
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
What?

179
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
The one from Nittere's Friday Road Show.

180
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,000
It's like, fa-la-la-la-la-la-la.

181
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
It's at the bridge like this.

182
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I don't get it.

183
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I get it.

184
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I get it.

185
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Well, I get it.

186
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:14,000
But the drama is out, so please send me a gala.

187
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I'm counting on you.

188
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
It's really tough.

189
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I'll be doing this for the last time.

190
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
What is it?

191
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,000
On New Year's Eve, I'll be taking a break.

192
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
For your sake.

193
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Who told you to come?

194
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I did it for your sake.

195
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
It took a lot of time.

196
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
The make-up, the costumes, everything.

197
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I was surprised when I saw the gala.

198
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
It's 50,000 yen.

199
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
What? What do you mean by that?

200
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
It's not a lot?

201
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
You're stupid.

202
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I've sung that much, and it's 100,000 yen.

203
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
What? 100,000 yen?

204
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
That's right.

205
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Really?

206
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
It's New Year's Eve.

207
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
It has nothing to do with the date.

208
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
It has nothing to do with the date.

209
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
If it's New Year's Eve, I can get a part-time job.

210
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
You can get paid.

211
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
That's right.

212
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
It's not 50,000 yen.

213
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
But if you're in this situation,

214
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:20,000
do you know the look on your face when you go out and get 50,000 yen?

215
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,000
When you go out, you open your bag and do this.

216
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
You need a lot of stamina.

217
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I've been running since two months ago.

218
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
What's your bag?

219
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
It's this.

220
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I did it.

221
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
To be honest, I didn't think I'd get paid.

222
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Because we're friends.

223
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I don't know what friendship is.

224
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
You're the one who's talking.

225
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I didn't think I'd get paid.

226
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
That's why I forgot.

227
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
When I saw you, you said you'd pay 50,000 yen.

228
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
When I saw you, you said you'd pay 50,000 yen.

229
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
If that's the case, I don't need it.

230
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:08,000
You're not that big a deal.

231
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
What?

232
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
You said you'd pay 100,000 yen.

233
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I went to support you.

234
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I don't know why it's cheap.

235
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Support is more expensive.

236
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
That's right.

237
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,000
That's right.

238
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
No matter what you do, it's weird that I'm paying 50,000 yen and you're paying 100,000 yen.

239
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Don't say anything.

240
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I'll give you 25,000 yen.

241
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Wait.

242
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Are you going to be number one this year?

243
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
It doesn't matter.

244
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I went to support you.

245
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
It's weird that I'm cheaper.

246
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I'll give you 25,000 yen.

247
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:58,000
You're not that big a deal.

248
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
You're not that big a deal.

249
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
You're not that big a deal.

250
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:08,000
You're not that big a deal.

251
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I forgot.

252
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I don't need that little money.

253
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
That's right.

254
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
It's what you want.

255
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:20,000
You don't want to be paid 50,000 yen.

256
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
It's better to be told it's free.

257
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:29,000
You should have told me that you don't need money.

258
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
What?

259
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Why are you worried?

260
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I'm a big fan of acting.

261
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I'm a big fan of acting.

262
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I'm a big fan of acting.

263
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Congratulations.

264
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Thank you.

265
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I'm looking forward to your acting.

266
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Are you really going to act?

267
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Yes.

268
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Really?

269
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
What will you do?

270
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I'll be in the first and second place.

271
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Why can't you be in the first and second place?

272
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I'm in the first and second place.

273
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:10,000
It's like a Japanese show.

274
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
You want it?

275
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I don't want it.

276
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I work with money.

277
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
That's right.

278
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
That's a big difference between you and me.

279
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
What do you mean?

280
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I want to see everyone's smiles.

281
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
You...

282
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Are you stupid?

283
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I want to see everyone's smiles.

284
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:34,000
You want to see money and smile.

285
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
It's not the same smile.

286
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
It's not the same smile.

287
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Thank you.

288
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Thank you very much.

289
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Don't mention it.

290
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Thank you very much.

291
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I wonder if there's anything else.

292
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
There's nothing else.

293
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Really?

294
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I forgot.

295
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
There's nothing else I can do.

296
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
You forgot, didn't you?

297
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Yes.

298
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Don't you think this is popular?

299
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
That's an unexpected answer.

300
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
This is popular.

301
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Why?

302
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I think it's very popular among young people.

303
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Everyone does physical education.

304
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I'm from Shibuya.

305
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
What?

306
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I'm from Shibuya.

307
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Who are you?

308
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I'm from Shibuya.

309
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I see.

310
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
What?

311
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I'm from Shibuya.

312
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
What?

313
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I'm still young.

314
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Mr. Matsumoto is a night technician.

315
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Yes.

316
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:59,000
What kind of night technician is Ms. Matsumoto?

317
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
What do you mean by that?

318
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Didn't you see that?

319
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
What is that?

320
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Famicom communication.

321
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
What?

322
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Famicom communication?

323
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
What?

324
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Famicom communication?

325
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
What?

326
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Famicom?

327
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:28,000
It's not a computer. It's a Famicom.

328
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,000
It's a Famicom no matter what you do.

329
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:38,000
It's a Famicom no matter what you do.

330
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
You're a fool.

331
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I'm sorry.

332
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
You don't know about Famicom communication?

333
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
No, I don't.

334
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
It's not a Famicom. It's a Famicom from a while ago.

335
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Don't talk nonsense.

336
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:56,000
There's a microphone on the two-player of a Famicom from a while ago.

337
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
You're talking about my child.

338
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Don't talk about Famicom communication.

339
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,000
You're a fool.

340
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
You're a fool.

341
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Himawari Musume.

342
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Yes.

343
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
The new captain.

344
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
The new captain, Himawari Musume.

345
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
How old is he?

346
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
He's 48.

347
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
He's going to be 49?

348
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
He'll be 49.

349
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
The new captain?

350
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
He'll be 49.

351
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I see.

352
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Well, it's a female character.

353
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
What?

354
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
No, no.

355
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:32,000
You're kidding.

356
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I didn't ask if he was a female.

357
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
What?

358
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
You're asking a big question mark.

359
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
It's a woman's status.

360
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
A woman's status.

361
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I'm curious.

362
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Yes, yes, yes.

363
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
You understand?

364
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:48,500
Yes.

365
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,000
Then, please tell me.

366
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Okay, let's do it.

367
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
What?

368
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Why?

369
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
What's wrong with me?

370
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Well, what am I?

371
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
What am I? You're not my partner.

372
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Ah, a tsukkomi.

373
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I'm trying to do it now.

374
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Tsukkomi.

375
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
What am I?

376
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Tsukkomi?

377
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
No, no.

378
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
No, no, no.

379
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I'm starting to work now.

380
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
So, a man.

381
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Ah, a man.

382
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I'm a woman.

383
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
What should I do?

384
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I'm a man, right?

385
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:22,500
I'm a man.

386
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,000
I'm a man.

387
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I'm a man.

388
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I'm a man.

389
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
In such a cold way.

390
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I can't hold you.

391
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I can't hold you.

392
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
You want to hold me?

393
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Hold me like you're holding me.

394
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Yes, yes.

395
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I can't hold you to your heart.

396
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I understand.

397
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
What should I do?

398
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I'm a man, right?

399
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Yes, you're a man.

400
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
From here?

401
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Yes, from here.

402
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
It's like a game of UWF.

403
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Let's enter like this.

404
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Wait a minute.

405
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I'm doing it like this, but I'm going to sleep here.

406
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I'm going to enter like this.

407
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
This is dangerous.

408
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I'm going to enter like this.

409
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I'm going to enter like this.

410
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
I'm going to enter like this.

411
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
I'm going to show you the power of love.

412
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Get out of my way.

413
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Come here.

414
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Come here.

415
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
From the 13th of next month, you're going to be a witch, Matsumoto-san.

416
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Please teach me the magic spell that turns all the women in the world into nudes.

417
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,000
In the past, there was a manga called Nagaigo.

418
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
No, no.

419
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
For the time being, you're going to be a witch from the 13th of next month, right?

420
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Yes.

421
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I'm going to be 14.

422
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Yes, I'm going to be 14.

423
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
We're going to be 14.

424
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Why are you saying that?

425
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
We're going to be 14.

426
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
We're going to be traveling on a broom.

427
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
From the 13th of next month.

428
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
What is it?

429
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Please teach me the spell.

430
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
What do you think it is?

431
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
You're going to be a witch tomorrow, right?

432
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Yes, I'm going to be a witch tomorrow.

433
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
It's almost time.

434
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I can feel it in my body right now.

435
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
You can feel it?

436
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
What do you mean?

437
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
I feel like I'm going to be a witch.

438
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
It's the same picture.

439
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
But you just forgave me.

440
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
I'm starting to feel like I'm going to be a witch.

441
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
How does your body feel right now?

442
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,000
It's hard to explain it with words.

443
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
You can't explain it in detail.

444
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
It's hard.

445
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I'm worried about the steam coming out of the rice.

446
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
It's going to be like this.

447
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Are you pregnant?

448
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
It's like that.

449
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
What is it?

450
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
All the women in the world are nude.

451
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
I understand.

452
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:27,000
First of all, it's embarrassing for a girl to wear clothes.

453
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Why am I wearing clothes?

454
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
I see.

455
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
First of all, I'm going to be naked.

456
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:37,000
I'm going to tell a woman that I'm really naked.

457
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
It has nothing to do with the spell.

458
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Wait a minute.

459
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Open the blind.

460
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
What are you doing?

461
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
The woman is surprised.

462
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
That's right.

463
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
At this stage, I'm not wearing clothes in my world yet.

464
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
You may be naked.

465
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I may be naked.

466
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
At that time, I look back.

467
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Why are you wearing clothes?

468
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
You...

469
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
You...

470
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
That's enough.

471
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
That's what a woman thinks.

472
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Until now, I thought I was stupid.

473
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I see.

474
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
That's right.

475
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
I think I'm crazy.

476
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Why are you wearing clothes?

477
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
What are you doing?

478
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:46,000
If you say that...

479
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
I'll do this.

480
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
First of all...

481
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
I'm sorry.

482
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:10,000
I'm scared.
