1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
High Tension! The Best!

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Good evening!

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Good evening!

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
It has started again this week!

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
That's right!

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
High Tension! The Best!

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
By the way, this corner is not very popular among the general public.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
However, Mr. Uchimura of Uchannanjan is very popular.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Is that so?

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
If there is one more person...

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Yes?

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
High Tension! The Best!

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The 10th place this week is...

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Moro Strike!

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
KoKoriko!

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Naoki Tanaka!

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
No.47!

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Welcome to the show!

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Thank you!

20
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Thank you!

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
You are the 10th place for your first appearance.

22
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Yes!

23
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
This time, the 10th place song was canceled.

24
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
That song was canceled.

25
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Mr. Tanaka, your mother is calling you today.

26
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Is that so?

27
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Please talk to her.

28
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Hello?

29
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Hello?

30
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Nao-chan?

31
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Isn't it real?

32
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Don't use honorifics to your mother.

33
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Mom?

34
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Yes?

35
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
It's Nao-chan.

36
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Hello?

37
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Your son is the 10th place.

38
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Is that so?

39
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Yes.

40
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Thank you.

41
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
No problem.

42
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Why don't you say something?

43
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I was surprised.

44
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
What?

45
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I thought it was real.

46
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Hello?

47
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Hello?

48
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Please do your best for your mother.

49
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Mom?

50
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Yes?

51
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Don't do that.

52
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Hello?

53
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Hello?

54
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
How are you?

55
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Please watch it.

56
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Please watch it.

57
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Thank you.

58
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Mr. Tanaka, please stand by.

59
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Thank you.

60
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
He's a little shaken.

61
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
There are some difficult things to do.

62
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Let's go.

63
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:23,000
This week's 10th place, Mr. Tanaka will do a mono strike.

64
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Mr. Tanaka.

65
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Mr. Tanaka.

66
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Thank you very much.

67
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Thank you very much.

68
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
This program is brought to you by these sponsors.

69
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Let's continue.

70
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000

00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000

00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000

Gokuraku Tonbo.

00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Kato Koji.

78
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Excuse me.

79
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Yes.

80
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Ladies and gentlemen.

81
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Yes.

82
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
The 9th and 8th place Gokuraku Tonbo have a day off due to work.

83
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Is that so?

84
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Yes.

85
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Thank you very much.

86
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Please come next time.

87
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Please come.

88
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Let's continue.

89
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,000
The 7th place this week is 163 points.

90
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Miyasako Hiroiki.

91
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Hello, Mr. Kojikan.

92
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Hello.

93
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Hello.

94
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
This time...

95
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
It's the 7th place.

96
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
It's the 7th place.

97
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
It's only Miyasako, isn't it?

98
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
What about you, Mr. Hotoyama?

99
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I'm out of the ranking.

100
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I'm making a new song right now.

101
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I see.

102
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
You have to do your best.

103
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I'll do my best today.

104
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
What's wrong?

105
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I'm fine.

106
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Why are you angry?

107
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
You're very strict.

108
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Yes.

109
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
What is it?

110
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Are you dissatisfied with the 7th place?

111
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Yes.

112
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I don't know.

113
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I'm confident in this song.

114
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
What?

115
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
The 7th place...

116
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I don't know what to say.

117
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Do you have a pattern of going up next time?

118
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I'm not sure about the 7th place this time.

119
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I see.

120
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I don't know what to say.

121
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Standby.

122
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
The 7th place.

123
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Yes.

124
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Thank you.

125
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Thank you.

126
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Let's go.

127
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
The 7th place this week.

128
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:56,000
The 7th place is Miyasako Hiroyuki's new song.

129
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
My stomach hurts.

130
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
My stomach hurts.

131
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Something came out.

132
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I'm going to give birth.

133
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Hello.

134
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Thank you very much.

135
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
It was a wonderful performance.

136
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
It was good.

137
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
It was good.

138
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
It's true that the 7th place is not good.

139
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I see.

140
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Thank you.

141
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Let's continue.

142
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
The 6th place this week is...

143
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
185 points.

144
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
It's a surprise.

145
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Takasu Hamane.

146
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
This is his first appearance.

147
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
That's right.

148
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I'm sorry.

149
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Unfortunately, it's because of work.

150
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Is that so?

151
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I can't come to the studio, but I'm shooting a VTR.

152
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Is that so?

153
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Yes.

154
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Let's take a look.

155
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Let's go.

156
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,000
It's Tokyo Station again.

157
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
What is it?

158
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I'm surprised.

159
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
You're still doing it.

160
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I'm surprised.

161
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I'm surprised.

162
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I'm happy.

163
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I stepped on the ground.

164
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
It's cold.

165
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
It's too cold.

166
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Thank you very much.

167
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
However, the 6th place is...

168
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,000
The 5th place this week is...

169
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
254 points.

170
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Aihohoi.

171
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:38,000
This is Mr. Endo Shodo.

172
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
This is the 4th place.

173
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Mr. Endo, who was the 1st place last time, is the 5th place.

174
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
What do you think?

175
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
It's strange that a person like me takes the 1st place.

176
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
If you think about it, it's about 5th place.

177
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
It's a great comment that you have some room.

178
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Are you okay?

179
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
You're naked.

180
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Mr. Endo, since you've been naked, you've never hugged a woman.

181
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
It's been about two months.

182
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I haven't talked to a woman in person.

183
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Let's go to the 5th place.

184
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Let's go.

185
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
The 5th place this week is...

186
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Mr. Endo Shodo.

187
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Aihohoi.

188
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Do you know Puerto Rico?

189
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Are you going to Puerto Rico?

190
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Where is Puerto Rico?

191
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
What am I?

192
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Aihohoi.

193
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Thank you very much.

194
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I think you still have a lot of energy left.

195
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I can't help it if I fall in love.

196
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,000
The 4th place this week is...

197
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
301 points.

198
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
T.S. I Love Me.

199
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Animal Teedan.

200
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Osaru.

201
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Please.

202
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Kattobase Kakefu.

203
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
It was Kakefu.

204
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I see.

205
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
There's a lot of dirty stuff.

206
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
It's just Osaru.

207
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I'll do my best.

208
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Please stand by.

209
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Thank you very much.

210
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I'll do it barefoot.

211
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Let's go.

212
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
The 4th place this week is...

213
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Animal Teedan.

214
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Osaru.

215
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
T.S. I Love Me.

216
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Glasses.

217
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Yasushi-kun.

218
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Tie yourself.

219
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Thank you very much.

220
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Thank you for your hard work.

221
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
It was really great.

222
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,000
It's great to be at the top.

223
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Let's take a break.

224
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
What?

225
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Before announcing the 3rd place.

226
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Isn't that enough?

227
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
What are you doing?

228
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Let's go to the 3rd place.

229
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Let's take a break.

230
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
This week's spotlight.

231
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
This week's spotlight is...

232
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
The 9th place from the prefecture.

233
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
The 23rd place this week is...

234
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Yamasaki Hosei.

235
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Yes.

236
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
It's a spotlight.

237
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
The previous song was really bad.

238
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
It didn't work at all.

239
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,000
This time, it's the song of love.

240
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
The song of love.

241
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
The song of the planet.

242
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
The song of the planet.

243
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
How long do you think you can go up?

244
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
How long do you think you can go up?

245
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Yamasaki-san.

246
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Yamasaki-san.

247
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Yamasaki-san.

248
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Yamasaki-san.

249
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Yamasaki-san.

250
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
It's not Hong Kong.

251
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
It's because it's us.

252
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Please understand.

253
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
It's a big hit.

254
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
You're lying.

255
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Everyone says it's a big hit.

256
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
It's a big hit.

257
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Please stand by.

258
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Let's go.

259
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
This week's 23rd place is...

260
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Yamasaki Hosei.

261
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
The song of the planet.

262
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:16,000
The song of the planet.

263
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:23,000
The song of the planet.

264
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:31,000
The song of the planet.

265
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Kya!

266
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,000
It's so refreshing!

267
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
It's so refreshing!

268
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
It's so refreshing!

269
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Okay, thank you very much.

270
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
It's so refreshing that it makes you want to cry.

271
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Okay, let's go!

272
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I think he knows best.

273
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Let's go for the last one this week!

274
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
350 points!

275
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Men and women are different!

276
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Fujii Takashi!

277
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Hello, Fujii-san.

278
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Hello, hello.

279
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Hello, hello.

280
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Fujii-san, this is your new song, right?

281
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
That's right.

282
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
It's your third song.

283
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Yes, it's a new song, but somehow it's so mysterious.

284
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
It's a new song, so it's fine.

285
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I see.

286
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
This week, we've received a letter from a friend of Shingeki-san.

287
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Oh, it's fine.

288
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
If you don't want to do the warm-up, go to Osaka's famous Pachi-pachi-panchiya.

289
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
You're George-san, right?

290
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Yes, yes, yes.

291
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
You're George-san, right?

292
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
God, Fujii-kun is in the top 10.

293
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Is he okay? Please protect him.

294
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Thank you for your growth.

295
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
It's Master Kuwabara, right?

296
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Yes, yes.

297
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Kuwabara Kazo-sama.

298
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
From now on, you don't have to worry about me.

299
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I see.

300
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
The three of you.

301
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Huh?

302
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
The three of you.

303
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I understand.

304
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Thank you very much.

305
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Are you feeling sick?

306
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I'm fine.

307
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Let's move on to the third place. Fujii Takashi-san.

308
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
A man and a woman are different.

309
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
A man and a woman are different.

310
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Shut up.

311
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
That was easy.

312
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I see.

313
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
This is from Osaka for that.

314
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
That's right.

315
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
The second place of this week is...

316
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
449 points.

317
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Human's eyesight.

318
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I won't let you say goodbye.

319
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I, Ritton Chosadan, will take the water.

320
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Okay.

321
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I won't let you say goodbye.

322
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Huh?

323
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I'm sorry.

324
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Yes.

325
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Ritton-san.

326
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Yes.

327
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I won't let you come to the studio.

328
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Is that so?

329
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
It's been a while since the ranking went up.

330
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
That's right.

331
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
It was the same last time.

332
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Yes.

333
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
But this time, I have a phone call for you.

334
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Yes.

335
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Hello?

336
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Hello?

337
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Is this Mizuno-san?

338
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
This is my partner Fujiwara.

339
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Is this Fujiwara-san?

340
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Yes.

341
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Where are you now?

342
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I'm at work right now.

343
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I'm in Hamamatsu.

344
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Hamamatsu?

345
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Yes.

346
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I've been busy lately.

347
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Yes.

348
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Where is Mizuno-san?

349
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Can you hear me?

350
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I'm already excited.

351
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Yes.

352
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I've been excited all day.

353
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Is this Mizuno-san's voice?

354
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
That's right.

355
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Ah.

356
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Yes.

357
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
This is wonderful.

358
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Yes.

359
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Okay, then.

360
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Please give me the human power.

361
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Human power!

362
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Boo!

363
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Ah!

364
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I want to play baseball.

365
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I want to play baseball.

366
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I want to play baseball.

367
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
But I can't use my hands here and there.

368
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I want to play baseball.

369
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Boo!

370
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Give me some water.

371
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Give me some water.

372
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Let me go.

373
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Let me go.

374
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Let go of me.

375
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Don't hold on to me.

376
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Give me Curry's glasses.

377
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Curry's glasses.

378
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Give me Curry's glasses.

379
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Curry's glasses.

380
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Ah...

381
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Well, it's a little long, isn't it?

382
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Yes.

383
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Well, well, well.

384
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I don't know why, but this is already our second place.

385
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Second place?

386
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
It's going up.

387
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
That means, who is the winner?

388
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
That's right.

389
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
It can't be. Let's go.

390
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
The winner of this week is...

391
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
The winner of this week is 524 points.

392
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Yosh, Hurricane Jelassie.

393
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Kokoriko, Endo Shouzou.

394
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Top 10 and 2nd place.

395
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
2nd place.

396
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
And the new song is 1st place.

397
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,000
This song was released before Aiho.

398
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
What is Aiho?

399
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Aiho.

400
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
The song that was released before Aiho.

401
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Thanks to Aiho, it became popular.

402
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,000
On the contrary, Aiho made it popular.

403
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
That's right.

404
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Right?

405
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
It's wonderful.

406
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
If you wear something like this, won't it stand out too much?

407
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
What's the point of not having a woman?

408
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
That's what I want to say.

409
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I want to go to the gala with you.

410
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
That's what I want to say.

411
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Thank you.

412
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Let's get ready.

413
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Go from the back.

414
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Let's go.

415
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
The winner of this week is...

416
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Yosh, Hurricane Jelassie.

417
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
From now on...

418
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I will...

419
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Do it.

420
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Do it.

421
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Do it.

422
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Do it.

423
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I want to eat corn.

424
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I want to eat it.

425
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I want to eat it.

426
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I want to eat umeboshi.

427
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I want to eat it.

428
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Whale.

429
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Whale.

430
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Whale.

431
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Hurricane.

432
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Hurricane.

433
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Hurricane.

434
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Hurricane.

435
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I want to eat...

436
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Corn.

437
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I want to eat.

438
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Thank you.

439
00:17:49,000 --> 00:18:01,000
There is a long line!

440
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Let's take a group picture!

441
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,140
version

442
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:05,740
I must go to the restroom

443
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:22,440
In the harbor, my hand sways

444
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:26,540
And that guy, a taxi driver

445
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:27,940
asi

446
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:30,340
vert

447
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:32,340
How are you doing?

448
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:43,340
How are you doing recently?

449
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:44,340
How are you doing?

450
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:46,340
Why aren't you saying anything?

451
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:49,340
Well, taxi drivers are getting better and better.

452
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:51,340
What do you mean by getting better?

453
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:53,340
How have you been doing since then?

454
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:54,340
What do you mean?

455
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:59,340
After you went on air, have you been like, Ma-chan, can you write a song for me?

456
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:00,340
No, but...

457
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:02,340
Wait a minute!

458
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:04,340
I don't understand.

459
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:05,340
I understand.

460
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:07,340
You were talking about that last week, right?

461
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:09,340
That's right. I talked about it a lot.

462
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:12,340
Well...

463
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:18,340
When you don't look at my eyes properly, it means nothing is coming.

464
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:20,340
Actually, I thought about it.

465
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:27,340
I thought it would be nice to hire an artist to sing a taxi driver song.

466
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:30,340
The other day, I didn't ask who you wanted me to sing it for.

467
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:31,340
That's right.

468
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:35,340
So, instead of me writing a new song and making a song,

469
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,340
that taxi driver is a masterpiece.

470
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:40,340
It's a masterpiece that goes against the sun.

471
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:41,340
So...

472
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:43,340
Isn't that a kind of cheating?

473
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:46,340
I've never cheated.

474
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:49,340
What kind of cheating are you talking about since last week?

475
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:51,340
It's like the old days.

476
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:53,340
It's like a blue 300.

477
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:55,340
I've got the nuances.

478
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:57,340
I've got the exes.

479
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:58,340
But that's not cheating.

480
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:05,340
If you say that, it's cheating that I'm wearing a jean and that I thought of wearing a jean.

481
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:08,340
Well, well...

482
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:13,340
I'm scared of your face.

483
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:17,340
The other day, I went to the countdown TV.

484
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:20,340
At that time, both you and I...

485
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:27,340
I found out that the staff were really scared.

486
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:28,340
That's not true.

487
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:33,340
When we were shooting the song, we went into the studio.

488
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:34,340
There was a set of songs.

489
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:36,340
I've got a set change.

490
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:39,340
I've got a chair waiting for me.

491
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:40,340
Did you see that?

492
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:41,340
What is it?

493
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,340
There are five pipe chairs.

494
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:44,340
That's good.

495
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:45,340
Five?

496
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:47,340
That's for that member.

497
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:53,340
There are two soft sofas next to the pipe chair.

498
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:55,340
I don't know.

499
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:56,340
I don't know.

500
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:57,340
Really?

501
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:58,340
Really?

502
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:03,340
The soft sofa is completely different from the pipe chair.

503
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:08,340
There are two soft sofas that can fit about 30 pipe chairs.

504
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:09,340
I don't know.

505
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:12,340
What do you mean?

506
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:14,340
The other members sit on the pipe chair.

507
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:22,340
You and I thought I would go crazy if there were seven pipe chairs.

508
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:25,340
I asked them to sit on two of them.

509
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:26,340
Of course.

510
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:27,340
You're not the only one.

511
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:28,340
Why?

512
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:29,340
It's safe.

513
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:31,340
There are five pipe chairs and two soft sofas.

514
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:35,340
This is a downtown thing no matter how you think about it.

515
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:38,340
That's a downtown thing no matter how you think about it.

516
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:45,340
I don't dare to write it down, but you get it, right?

517
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:48,340
Fujiwara is amazing.

518
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:49,340
Well, well, well, well.

519
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:51,340
That's great.

520
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:57,340
I was working in the neighborhood of my apartment for about a week.

521
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:59,340
It was a little noisy and hard to sleep.

522
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:02,340
But that has nothing to do with Fujiwara.

523
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:07,340
It's a normal conversation.

524
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:11,340
Fujiwara, it was noisy today, too.

525
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:14,340
You don't have to say, is that so?

526
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:16,340
It's a normal conversation.

527
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:19,340
I'm sorry.

528
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:28,340
It's really annoying.

529
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:30,340
Really?

530
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:33,340
I'm sorry.

531
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:44,340
Is there construction going on on your back?

532
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:50,340
Once, when Mr. Sanma did something with seven men and women, it was amazing.

533
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:53,340
When Kagetsu came, everyone was amazing.

534
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:59,340
It was dangerous.

535
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:07,340
It was so loud that I couldn't sleep in the dressing room.

536
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:10,340
You do it, too.

537
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:12,340
I don't remember that.

538
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:13,340
Really?

539
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:15,340
I couldn't help it because I didn't like it.

540
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:19,340
I thought I would say hello to him if I met him once.

541
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:24,340
I met him in the dressing room.

542
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:30,340
I thought he didn't like it.

543
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:34,340
He said, good morning.

544
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:37,340
He said, say hello to me.

545
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:40,340
I said, good morning.

546
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:45,340
I'll give you a present.

547
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:49,340
He said, yes.

548
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:57,340
I don't accept that kind of greeting.

549
00:23:57,340 --> 00:24:02,340
I said, come here.

550
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:06,340
It's scary.

551
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:14,340
Good morning.

552
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:20,340
Thank you for watching.
