1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Happy Birthday to you!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Happy Birthday to you!

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Happy Birthday to you!

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
You...

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
You...

6
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
You've been doing this for 2 years now!

7
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Ah, I'm sorry!

8
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Happy Birthday to you!

9
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Happy Birthday to you!

10
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Hey, last year you were even better!

11
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm not like this anymore!

12
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
You're making me blush!

13
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
That means I'm more interesting than last year!

14
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
You're more interesting than last year!

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Next time, on the Gaki no Chikai Alliance,

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Chikichiki Shinto Mechakusureba

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Himamata Sushi Daisakusen!

18
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Mr. Asakusa, what is this all about?

19
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Today, we're here at the Asakusa Torinji.

20
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Yes, we're here.

21
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
What is this all about?

22
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
We've decided to do a dodgeball match soon.

23
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Yes, we will.

24
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
We've decided to do a dodgeball match soon.

25
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Yes.

26
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
We've decided to do a dodgeball match soon.

27
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
We've decided to do a dodgeball match soon.

28
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
We're counting on you.

29
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Well, it's impossible to gain strength from now on.

30
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
So, we'll start from the spirit.

31
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I see.

32
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
That's why we've come here today.

33
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Yes.

34
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
We've come here for dinner.

35
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Let's have fun together.

36
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Please come in.

37
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
In the middle.

38
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Don't open your eyes.

39
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
You see how on TV,

40
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
you're sitting like this,

41
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
and the ball is going from behind, right?

42
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
That's right.

43
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
So, today, we'll have dinner.

44
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Ah, really?

45
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Yes, please.

46
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Stand up like this.

47
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
This guy is...

48
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
The producer's fault is that he's so cheeky.

49
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Is that so?

50
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Well, I hope you win this time.

51
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I'll do my best.

52
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
He's so cheeky.

53
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Let me stab him.

54
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
He's so cheeky.

55
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
He seems to be serious only at this time.

56
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
That's it.

57
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Now the show will get excited, right?

58
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Yes.

59
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I'll do my best at the supermarket.

60
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Do you do that kind of show?

61
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Yes, I do.

62
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
And I'm from America.

63
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
This program is brought to you by these sponsors.

64
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
The next day

65
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
The next day

66
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
The next day

67
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
The next day

68
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
You're smart.

69
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Are you okay?

70
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I'm fine.

71
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Are you okay?

72
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Then, let's sing together.

73
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Lower your head.

74
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I'll watch this show.

75
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I'll watch it when I go home.

76
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I'll watch it when I go home.

77
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Please do it again.

78
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I'm sorry.

79
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Please do it again.

80
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Thank you.

81
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Is there anyone who wants to do it again?

82
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
What's this?

83
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I'll do it again.

84
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I don't think you want to do it again.

85
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
That's right.

86
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Please do it again.

87
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
That's it.

88
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
That's too much.

89
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Thank you very much.

90
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
What's next?

91
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Next is...

92
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I don't know what kind of disaster will happen.

93
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I don't know what kind of disaster will happen.

94
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
That's right.

95
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Be quiet.

96
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Be quiet.

97
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Don't move.

98
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Don't move.

99
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I'm giving you a tissue.

100
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I'm giving you a tissue.

101
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I'm giving you a tissue.

102
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I'm giving you a tissue.

103
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Let's take it.

104
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I'm giving you a tissue.

105
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
He's a spider.

106
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
It hurts.

107
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Please do it against the edge of your teeth.

108
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I'll do it from the bottom of my heart.

109
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I'll do it from the bottom of my heart.

110
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Mr. Hamada.

111
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
That's it.

112
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I wonder if their spirits have gotten stronger.

113
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I wonder if their spirits have gotten stronger.

114
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I don't know about that.

115
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I think all of them are bad.

116
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I want to punish the worst of them.

117
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I want to punish the worst of them.

118
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I want to punish the worst of them.

119
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
The one that stood out the most was...

120
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
The one that stood out the most was...

121
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Otomo-kun.

122
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I saw him earlier.

123
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Don't open your eyes.

124
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Don't open your eyes.

125
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Don't open your eyes.

126
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Otomo, what are you looking at?

127
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I think Suga is the one who's hot right now.

128
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I opened my eyes.

129
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Otomo opened his eyes.

130
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I opened my eyes.

131
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I saw him.

132
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Oh no.

133
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I opened my eyes even though I told you not to look.

134
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I opened my eyes even though I told you not to look.

135
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I think it's Nitta.

136
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I think it's Nitta.

137
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I see.

138
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Why do you have so much hair?

139
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Why can't you get a haircut?

140
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
In the end,

141
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
it's Nitta.

142
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I see.

143
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Let's give a round of applause to Nitta-kun.

144
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Here we go.

145
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
It's hot.

146
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
It's hot.

147
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
It's hot.

148
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
He's crying.

149
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
He's crying.

150
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
He's crying.

151
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
It's hot.

152
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Ladies and gentlemen.

153
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I'm so excited.

154
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I don't know what to do.

155
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
It's been a long time.

156
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
It's been a long time.

157
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I'll do my best today.

158
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I'll do my best today.

159
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
What are you going to do?

160
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
What are you talking about?

161
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I don't know.

162
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
You were talking about something random.

163
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
You were talking about something random.

164
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
You talk about something random.

165
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I'll talk about it.

166
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
It's hot these days.

167
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Why?

168
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Is it hot?

169
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Wait a minute.

170
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I didn't say why.

171
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
What's wrong with you when you say so?

172
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
What's wrong with you when you say so?

173
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
It's hot!

174
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Everyone, I think.

175
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
In people,

176
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
In people,

177
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:17,040
The

178
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,540
And then he goes like this, right?

179
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:22,040
The old man is a bit of a fool.

180
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,040
That's how it is.

181
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,040
The role has been decided, right?

182
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,040
The role, right?

183
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,040
Right?

184
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:33,040
That's why you can't just let it go like that.

185
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,040
You want to get caught.

186
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:38,040
The personality of a guy who goes like that is a bit strange.

187
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,040
It's bad.

188
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,040
It's definitely like that.

189
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,040
It's not like that at all.

190
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:43,540
Why?

191
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:47,040
It's not like that at all, right?

192
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,040
That's why, how do I say it?

193
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:51,040
I often say things like that in the manga,

194
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,040
but when I'm watching TV,

195
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,040
you know,

196
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:57,040
when I'm watching TV,

197
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,540
or when I'm at the venue today,

198
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:00,540
I say things like that instead.

199
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:02,540
I say things that you can't help but say,

200
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:03,540
and you're like,

201
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:06,540
I've said things that you can't help but say.

202
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:09,040
I've said things that make everyone laugh.

203
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,540
I say things that you can't help but say,

204
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:11,040
and you're like,

205
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,540
people who are listening,

206
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:14,040
people who are listening,

207
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:14,540
they'll think,

208
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:16,040
you're such an idiot!

209
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,040
And then you'll say,

210
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,040
you're such an idiot!

211
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,040
That's how it is.

212
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,040
It's a change.

213
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,040
And then you'll be like,

214
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,040
yeah, yeah,

215
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:25,040
I don't think he's an idiot.

216
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,040
Right?

217
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,040
Yeah, yeah.

218
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,040
The details.

219
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,040
But, but,

220
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,040
even if you're like that,

221
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,040
when you're at home,

222
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,040
for example,

223
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,040
when you're watching TV,

224
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:35,040
you don't say things like that?

225
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,040
If it's strange.

226
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,040
You don't say things like,

227
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:39,040
you're a liar!

228
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,040
I have that too.

229
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,040
You do.

230
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,040
I do.

231
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:43,040
I think everyone has that.

232
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:45,040
When it comes to saying things like that,

233
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,040
me or anyone else has it.

234
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,040
Everyone has it.

235
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:50,040
From where and where is it saying things like that?

236
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,040
Eh?

237
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,040
For example,

238
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,040
when you're angry,

239
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,040
when you say,

240
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,040
you're such an idiot,

241
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,040
that's a saying.

242
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,040
When you're angry,

243
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,040
that's a joke.

244
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,040
In that sense,

245
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,040
it's a joke,

246
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,040
but,

247
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,040
when you say,

248
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,040
you're such an idiot,

249
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,040
that's a saying.

250
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,040
If you're going to say something like that,

251
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,040
it's,

252
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,040
you're such an idiot,

253
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,040
that's a joke.

254
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,040
You don't say things like that.

255
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,040
This is,

256
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,040
you know,

257
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,040
it's in the anime too,

258
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,040
saying things like that.

259
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:18,040
When I research it.

260
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,040
When did you research it?

261
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,040
Well,

262
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,040
for example,

263
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,040
what and what?

264
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,040
In the anime,

265
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,040
for example,

266
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,040
what and what?

267
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,040
That's why,

268
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,040
I wrote it on the radio before,

269
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,040
but,

270
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,040
in Asuta no Joe,

271
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,040
saying things like that,

272
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,040
it's a joke,

273
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,040
that's a saying.

274
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,040
Eh?

275
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,040
What about Joe?

276
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,040
Which one?

277
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,040
Joe,

278
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,040
in Asuta no Joe,

279
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,040
saying things like that,

280
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,040
it's a joke,

281
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,040
that's a joke.

282
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,040
Who said that?

283
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,040
Tange, Danpei,

284
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,040
said that.

285
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,040
I see.

286
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,040
It's already decided.

287
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,040
Why is that?

288
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,040
What do you mean?

289
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:50,040
That's completely a joke too!

290
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,040
What's so good about it?

291
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,040
You know,

292
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,040
when someone says something,

293
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,040
and you say,

294
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,040
hehe,

295
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,040
and you laugh,

296
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,040
that's a joke.

297
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,040
I see.

298
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,040
You can't reply.

299
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,040
You can't reply.

300
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,040
You can't talk.

301
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,040
That's right.

302
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,040
When you can't talk,

303
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,040
you just say,

304
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,040
hehehe.

305
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,040
That's right.

306
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,040
That's right.

307
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,040
That's also a complete joke.

308
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,040
That's true.

309
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,040
In the anime,

310
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,040
there's also a joke

311
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,040
and a punchline.

312
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,040
Kyutaro the ghost.

313
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,040
The joke is

314
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,040
Kyutaro,

315
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,040
right?

316
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,040
Who's the punchline?

317
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,040
You know,

318
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,040
the punchline is Pico.

319
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,040
My sister's.

320
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,040
Oh,

321
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,040
really?

322
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,040
But,

323
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,040
the joke is Kyu-chan,

324
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,040
and the Pico is the punchline,

325
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,040
but the natural joke,

326
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,040
the one that's like

327
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,040
Jimmy Onishi,

328
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,040
is Ojiro.

329
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,040
Ah.

330
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,040
He doesn't talk.

331
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,040
He only says,

332
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,040
bakeratta.

333
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,040
Even if he gets punched,

334
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,040
he says,

335
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,040
bakeratta.

336
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,040
He's like Jo and Ishii.

337
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,040
He's like Jo.

338
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,040
No matter what he says,

339
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,040
he can't talk.

340
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,040
That's right.

341
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,040
That's also in animals.

342
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,040
What does that mean?

343
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,040
You know,

344
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,040
there's a saying,

345
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,040
the strong eat the weak.

346
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,040
The strong eat the weak.

347
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,040
The strong eat the strong.

348
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,040
The weak eat the weak.

349
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,040
The strong eat the weak.

350
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,040
The weak eat the weak.

351
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,040
The strong eat the weak.

352
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,040
The weak eat the weak.

353
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,040
That's in the animal world.

354
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,040
So the lion is the joke?

355
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,040
What?

356
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,040
You don't listen to other people.

357
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,040
The strong eat the weak.

358
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,040
The strong eat the weak.

359
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,040
The strong eat the weak.

360
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,040
So the lion is the joke?

361
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,040
Yes, the lion is the joke.

362
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:20,040
The lion is the joke in everything.

363
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,040
He's so mean.

364
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:25,040
Then there's no joke that's as good as the lion.

365
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,040
Why?

366
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,040
There's no joke that's as good as the lion.

367
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,040
Really?

368
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,040
Yes.

369
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,040
So in the animal world,

370
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:34,040
the only joke is the lion?

371
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:39,040
What's with the lion's head?

372
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,040
In the animal world,

373
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,040
there are jokes and jokes.

374
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,040
But in the animal world,

375
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,040
the lion is the joke.

376
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,040
That's how strong the lion is.

377
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,040
Yohkann,

378
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:52,040
you're in a star group called Town Town.

379
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,040
Right?

380
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,040
I'm not in a group.

381
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,040
You're in charge of jokes.

382
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,040
You're in charge of jokes.

383
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,040
How's your head?

384
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,040
What?

385
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,040
Can you fight?

386
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,040
It's not in my legs yet.

387
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,040
In the Town Town,

388
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:12,040
you're in charge of jokes.

389
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:15,040
But you're never in charge of jokes.

390
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,040
You have times when you get in charge of jokes.

391
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,040
You go up against the wall like this,

392
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,040
saying,

393
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,040
strong, strong, strong, strong.

394
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,040
That's why in the animal world...

395
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,040
You,

396
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,040
You know...

397
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,040
What?

398
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,040
When you talk about people...

399
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,040
What is this?

400
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:37,040
There are times when your nose is red!

401
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,040
Don't you have that?

402
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,040
When your nose is red.

403
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:43,040
I don't have it.

404
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,040
There are times when your nose is red!

405
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,040
That's you.

406
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:51,040
It's definitely nose cancer.

407
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,040
That's enough.

408
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:57,040
There are no more pictures.

409
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,040
There are a lot of things like this.

410
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:01,040
I got it.

411
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,040
If you talk a little more...

412
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:08,040
There will be a lot of comedy boxes.

413
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:11,040
No, I don't know what's going to happen.

414
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,040
I don't want to go any further.

415
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:18,040
As expected.

416
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,040
I'm going to make a lot of things.

417
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,040
There are empty boxes.

418
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,040
There are.

419
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:25,040
There are empty boxes.

420
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,040
There are empty boxes.

421
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,040
There are empty boxes.

422
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,040
There are empty boxes.

423
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:35,040
There are empty boxes.

424
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:39,040
Please write.

425
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,040
What is that?

426
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:44,040
There are a lot of customers today.

427
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:46,040
Thank you.

428
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:48,040
Here.

429
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:52,040
It's a lie.

430
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,040
Let me introduce you.

431
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,040
This is Keigo Horiguchi.

432
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,040
He is 23 years old.

433
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,040
Is that so?

434
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,040
I thought he was younger.

435
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,040
He is from Shinagawa district, Tokyo.

436
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:06,040
His hobby is to go to...

437
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,040
...Yurakugai.

438
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,040
Yes, Yurakugai.

439
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:11,040
He likes to go to Yurakugai in Gotanda to look for matcha.

440
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,040
It's just one shot!

441
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:17,040
This is for those who are listening.

442
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,040
Why are you so nervous?

443
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:23,040
Everyone...

444
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,040
What?

445
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,040
I didn't do anything wrong.

446
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,040
You should have told me.

447
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,040
I did it proudly.

448
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,040
You didn't.

449
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,040
I said what I wanted to say.

450
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,040
Everyone...

451
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:37,040
Hey, hey, hey!

452
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,040
Why are you shaking?

453
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,040
I didn't do anything wrong.

454
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:42,040
It's okay.

455
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:48,040
Thank you very much.

456
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:52,040
There is a rumor in my class.

457
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:55,040
Hama-chan is Charlie Hama's son.

458
00:14:55,040 --> 00:15:01,040
Matcha grew up in the jungle of Africa.

459
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,040
Are you Charlie Hama's son?

460
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,040
What?

461
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,040
Charlie Hama.

462
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,040
This is hard.

463
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:08,040
There are many.

464
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:13,040
It's true that I grew up in the jungle.

465
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,040
Let's do it.

466
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,040
Bring it on.

467
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,040
How many doors do you have?

468
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,040
Not many.

469
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:26,040
It's true that I grew up in the jungle.

470
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,040
Who raised you?

471
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,040
What?

472
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,040
Who raised you?

473
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,040
What?

474
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,040
Who raised you?

475
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:41,040
Flamingo.

476
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:45,040
Are you okay with that?

477
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,040
Flamingo raised me.

478
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:52,040
Why were you in Africa when you were little?

479
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:56,040
Good question.

480
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,040
Can you do it?

481
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,040
Yes.

482
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:17,040
One day, I went to Africa to play.

483
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,040
It's true.

484
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:22,040
Even now, there is a place called flamingo.

485
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:26,040
When you shake your head, it's flamingo.

486
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:33,040
What?

487
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,040
Flamingo...

488
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:40,040
Flamingo...

489
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,040
You're slow.

490
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:44,040
That's not good.

491
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:49,040
Don't step on it.

492
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:53,040
The staff of Flamingo are scary.

493
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,040
Is that so?

494
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:58,040
When we were in Africa, they were smiling and laughing.

495
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:02,040
The staff of Flamingo were playing tag.

496
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:07,040
They thought we were just like bugs.

497
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:12,040
But if we waited for them to see us, they would call us stupid.

498
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:17,040
If we screamed, they would say, shut up, you idiot.

499
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:25,040
The only thing we're not afraid of is Team Zero's lines.

500
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:28,040
Why are you clapping?

501
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:36,040
You should stop making fun of the audience.

502
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:38,040
You say that, too.

503
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:42,040
I don't make fun of them.

504
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:44,040
Don't talk.

505
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:47,040
You say that, too.

506
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,040
I don't say that.

507
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,040
You do.

508
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,040
Have you ever heard of it?

509
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:57,040
Yes, I've heard of it.

510
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,040
You're a fool.

511
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:00,040
Hey!

512
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:02,040
That's not good.

513
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:07,040
Next is Ikki.

514
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:09,040
That's not good.

515
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,040
One more.

516
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:12,040
One more?

517
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:14,040
I'm tired.

518
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:16,040
Good evening.

519
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:18,040
I can't say good evening.

520
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:21,040
You can't usually say that.

521
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:23,040
It's an old saying.

522
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:28,040
Machan, Hama, good evening.

523
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,040
Say it.

524
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,040
Good evening.

525
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,040
Machan, Hama, good evening.

526
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:34,040
Good evening.

527
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:36,040
The set behind you has changed.

528
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,040
That's right.

529
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:39,040
I've been wondering about it.

530
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:42,040
While Machan and Hama are talking,

531
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:45,040
when the set on the right side is shown,

532
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:48,040
you can see something like a person's face.

533
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:50,040
That's written on the set.

534
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:55,040
I don't like that way of reading.

535
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:58,040
It says, I'm laughing a little.

536
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:03,040
It's here. It's in this picture.

537
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,040
It's true. It's in this picture.

538
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:08,040
If it's in a figure, it's in this picture.

539
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:11,040
Isn't it this?

540
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:14,040
It's in this picture.

541
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:18,040
It's a little funny.

542
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:20,040
It's around here.

543
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,040
It's a little funny.

544
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:23,040
Can't you see it from far away?

545
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:26,040
Can you see it from far away?

546
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:32,040
It's you!

547
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,040
No, no.

548
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:35,040
It's true.

549
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,040
Why are you laughing?

550
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:41,040
What should I do? It's difficult to laugh a little.

551
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:43,040
It's a little funny.

552
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,040
Is that so?

553
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,040
It's nothing.

554
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,040
It's nothing?

555
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,040
Yes.

556
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,040
Let's go home.

557
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,040
Yes.

558
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,040
Let's go home.

559
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,040
There's nothing else.

560
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,040
It's true.

561
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:54,040
What are you doing?

562
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:57,040
We're standing on the stage like this,

563
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:59,040
and we're talking like this.

564
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:02,040
I don't know if it's easy to talk,

565
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:05,040
but we don't talk for that long.

566
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:07,040
So I'm nervous.

567
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:10,040
Standing on the stage and being watched by everyone,

568
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:14,040
I'm very nervous.

569
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:17,040
You have some room.

570
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:21,040
This part is delicious.

571
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:23,040
I just put it in my pocket.

572
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:25,040
There's a cigarette.

573
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:27,040
That's it!

574
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:32,040
Let's go because I'm nervous.

575
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34,040
That's all.

576
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:37,040
I want to talk more.

577
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:39,040
I'll talk.

578
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,040
I'll talk.

579
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:43,040
I'll do this.

580
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:48,040
I'm going home.

581
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:54,040
I can't go home again.

582
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:59,040
That's true.

583
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,040
But...

584
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:05,040
That's it.

585
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:16,040
I've been smoking a lot lately.

586
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:18,040
About manga 1.

587
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:20,040
If manga 1 becomes like this,

588
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:22,040
I'll be in trouble.

589
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:25,040
The old lady.

590
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:27,040
Right?

591
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:29,040
The worried old lady.

592
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:31,040
If this happens, what should I do?

593
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,040
The old lady.

594
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,040
It's called Yoshinba.

595
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:40,040
What?

596
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:46,040
Didn't you think of this?

597
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:48,040
I'm not so confident.

598
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,040
Welcome.

599
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:54,040
Thank you.

600
00:21:54,040 --> 00:22:00,040
Hello.

601
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:04,040
Hello.

602
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:06,040
What are you doing?

603
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,040
What are you doing?

604
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,040
I'm talking.

605
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,040
If you don't talk, it's annoying.

606
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:11,040
That's right.

607
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,040
It's strange.

608
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,040
It's the ending.

609
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,040
Yes.

610
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:22,040
I'm an assistant.

611
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:27,040
Why don't you ask the staff to find a girlfriend?

612
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:30,040
Who's your girlfriend?

613
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:32,040
Yanaoka.

614
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:34,040
That's it.

615
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:37,040
Yanaoka.

616
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:39,040
Your girlfriend.

617
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:40,040
Takasu?

618
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:42,040
What do you think of Takasu?

619
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:43,040
Takasu.

620
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:46,040
You're calling me Michan.

621
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,040
Michan.

622
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:50,040
What?

623
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:53,040
Takasu is Michan.

624
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,040
That's good.

625
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:57,040
It's like the program has changed.

626
00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:00,040
And then there's the power man number two.

627
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:06,040
I met him on TV.

628
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,040
That's good.

629
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,040
That's good.

630
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,040
That's it.

631
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:14,040
Goodbye.

632
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:16,040
Good job.

633
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:24,040
Please give me a hug.

634
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:26,040
What's wrong with you?

635
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:29,040
Please lend me your T-shirt.

636
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:35,040
That's funny.

637
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:53,040
