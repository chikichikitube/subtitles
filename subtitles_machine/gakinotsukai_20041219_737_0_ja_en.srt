00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Hiroshi Fujiwara

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I'm Hiroshi Fujiwara.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Lately I've gained too much weight, and it's become difficult for me to cut my toenails.

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm Hiroshi Fujiwara. My wife is becoming more and more like me.

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm Hiroshi Fujiwara.

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I'm doing a fun New Year's event in Guminedo, Yoshimoto.

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Everyone, I'm waiting for you.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
You're doing a fun New Year's event?

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Fujiwara-san, are you going to cut your toenails again this year?

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Yes.

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Why don't you just cut your toenails with your license?

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm begging you. If everyone says Fujiwara, I'll remember you.

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm sorry.

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
This year, I've been chosen to be the general manager for seven consecutive years. I'm the former downtown manager, Hiroshi Fujiwara.

15
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I'm looking forward to working with you.

16
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Also, this year, I'm the one who knows the most about the use of children.

17
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
That's amazing.

18
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:44,000
The way you're knocking is amazing.

19
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I'm Kocho Bashibu.

20
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:58,000
This year, Kocho Bashibu has made a breakthrough in the field of high-speed rotation, which has been created in the past.

21
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
He's laughing.

22
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
He's laughing.

23
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
He's laughing.

24
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
He's laughing.

25
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
He's laughing.

26
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
He's laughing.

27
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
He's laughing.

28
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
He's laughing.

29
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Kocho Baffaro's general, Matsumoto...

30
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
He's a fool.

31
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
He's a fool.

32
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
It's hard to watch.

33
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:41,000
It's so hard to watch.

34
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:52,000
It's so hard to watch.

35
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
It's dangerous.

36
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
It's dangerous.

37
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:08,000
The K-1 fighter, Ernest Faust, is participating in this project in which the person who draws the skull card in the library has to be quiet

38
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:18,000
The K-1 fighter, Ernest Faust, is participating in this project in which the person who draws the skull card is to be quiet

39
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:47,000
The K-1 fighter, Ernest Faust, is participating in this project in which the person who draws the skull card in the library has to be quiet

40
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:58,000
The K-1 fighter, Ernest Faust, is participating in this project in which the person who draws the skull card in the library has to be quiet

41
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
The K-1 fighter, Ernest Faust, is participating in this project in which the person who draws the skull card in the library has to be quiet

42
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:11,000
The K-1 fighter, Ernest Faust, is participating in this project in which the person who draws the skull card in the library has to be quiet

43
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I have something to tell everyone

44
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I think Hamada is a little drunk

45
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:30,000
When I went home, I said hello to Haruhiko Kato and Shidou-kun, but when I looked at myself, I was a little drunk

46
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,000
The license to take care of children is set up for the members

47
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
But

48
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,000
The other child is a teenager who just graduated from high school this year

49
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
What?

50
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
He said that he likes young men

51
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
From tonight?

52
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:01,000
But he heard that he was one hour late, so he went out after spending some time

53
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
And one hour later

54
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,000
The K-1 fighter, Ernest Faust, is participating in this project in which the person who draws the skull card in the library has to be quiet

55
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
It's still only me

56
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I'm completely in tune

57
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
It's not the usual Seiji

58
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
It's funny

59
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I don't know what he's talking about

60
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
That's the only thing

61
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I just got a call from a woman

62
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Excuse me, cancel today

63
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
What?

64
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
And

65
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
The license to take care of children is set up for the members

66
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:51,000
But he heard that he was one hour late, so he went out after spending some time

67
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I won't do it

68
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I won't do it

69
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I don't know

70
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Why don't you say it?

71
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
It's impossible

72
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I don't know what to do

73
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
What is this?

74
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I don't know

75
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I see

76
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
There's a lot

77
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Everyone was strange

78
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
They don't talk about it

79
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
They don't

80
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I'll talk about it next year

81
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Really?

82
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Will you get a license next year?

83
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
There's a pattern

84
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
There's a pattern to get a license, but there's no pattern to get a license

85
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
There's no pattern to get a license?

86
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I want to see the karaoke after the host

87
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Karaoke

88
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
The VTR

89
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:23,000
It's amazing

90
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I want to see the karaoke after the host

91
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
It's good

92
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
It's amazing

93
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Next, please look at the 6th to 4th place

94
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Next, please look at the 6th place

95
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
The first time Hamada was called Kona Sonia

96
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
What did he see there?

97
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
The war is over

98
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
We were born

99
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Without knowing the war

100
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
It's a good song

101
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
It was amazing

102
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:20,000
It didn't fall at all

103
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Everyone got sweets

104
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Without knowing the war

105
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
How many groups were there?

106
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I don't know

107
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
How many groups were there?

108
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Happy Turn

109
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:42,000
How many groups were there?

110
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
In the first episode, Yamazaki is 36 years old

111
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
He is the last samurai

112
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Yamazaki is going to compete with a comedian of the same age

113
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
He is going to compete with a comedian of the same age

114
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
But this is actually a high-profile prank

115
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
He doesn't know that

116
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
He doesn't know that

117
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Kouji Higashino wins

118
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Let's win

119
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I'm not tired

120
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
The camera is out of order

121
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
It's okay if it's the last one

122
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
It's just a little

123
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I'm sorry

124
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
It's a technical problem

125
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
It's the last one

126
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
It's the last one

127
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
It's impossible

128
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
It's a little difficult

129
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I don't know what to do

130
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
It's strange

131
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Why didn't you talk to me on the way?

132
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
You should have stopped me on the way

133
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I'm sorry

134
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
What?

135
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Yes

136
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
You didn't talk to me

137
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Yes

138
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I'm sorry

139
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
We are doing the same thing

140
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Yes

141
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
We are doing the same thing

142
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Let's ask him to do something

143
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Let's ask Higashino to do something

144
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Let's ask him to do something

145
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Let's do that

146
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Let's ask him to do something

147
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I'm sorry

148
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Thank you

149
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Can you wait a minute?

150
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Can you wait a minute?

151
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I'm sorry

152
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I thought you were going to say you were sorry

153
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Let's go back to Higashino

154
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I've prepared the costumes

155
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Yes

156
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
To

157
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
To

158
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
To

159
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
It's different from the last one

160
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Today

161
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Senor will have a lot of worries

162
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
What?

163
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I want to solve it

164
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Please stay with me

165
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I hate music

166
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I'm always teased by girls

167
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:21,000
How can I sing like you?

168
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Let's solve it

169
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,000
It's okay if you don't sing

170
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
It's not like that

171
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Producer Suga invited the members to a high-class French cuisine

172
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:48,000
However, there is a strict rule that you have to be good at cooking

173
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
4th place Hema Chi and Paris

174
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
First, Matsumoto

175
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
It's beautiful

176
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
It's beautiful

177
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
It's beautiful

178
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
It stinks

179
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
It stinks

180
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I'm really happy

181
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
It stinks

182
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
10 minutes later, Matsumoto again

183
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
It stinks

184
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
It stinks

185
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
It stinks

186
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
It stinks

187
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Is it delicious?

188
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I see, it's like this when you put the mushrooms on the back

189
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I want to die

190
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Then, Hamada shows his amazing machine to stop Matsumoto's poison

191
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,000
It's here

192
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
It's here

193
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:58,000
However, this is just a small wound

194
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,000
It's here

195
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Is it delicious?

196
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Don't you eat this?

197
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Let's go next

198
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
It's like this

199
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
It's like this

200
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
It's like a wallet soldier

201
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I can't do it anymore

202
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
This is amazing

203
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
This is scary

204
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
It hurts

205
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
What should I do?

206
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
This is the end

207
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I don't want to do it anymore

208
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
It's really delicious

209
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
It's delicious

210
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:59,000
As usual, Hamada was surprised

211
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Even though I knew it was a prank, I was scared

212
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,000
This is the second time in Paris, isn't it?

213
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
It's like a handicap

214
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
That's right

215
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
It's not a big deal

216
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I've done it many times in other shows

217
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
The best 3 will be announced

218
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
The best 3 will be announced

219
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
The best 3 will be announced

220
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
The best 3 will be announced

221
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
The best 3 will be announced

222
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
The best 3 will be announced

223
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:41,000
In March, a charming couple, Eri, suddenly appeared in the dressing room and showed Matsumoto their love

224
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
The first blow of Eri

225
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
It's a blow

226
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
It's cool to be smoking

227
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
What are you doing?

228
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
What are you doing?

229
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
What are you doing?

230
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,000
In October, half a year later, she appeared in the dressing room again

231
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
The incident happened there

232
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Actually, I have something to tell you

233
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I want you to break up

234
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I have someone I like

235
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Who is it?

236
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I can't tell you the name

237
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I don't want to fight

238
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I don't know what to do

239
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Please tell me

240
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I can't tell you

241
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I know you

242
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
I know you

243
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I didn't say that

244
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I'll tell you

245
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I can't stand it

246
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Then, they put their love on Eri and make her disappear

247
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I can't stand it

248
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Let's start

249
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
It's the worst

250
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Eri is doing it

251
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Wait

252
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
It's dangerous

253
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Isn't it dangerous?

254
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Hiro

255
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Are you okay?

256
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
You can't touch it if it's on your back

257
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Hiro

258
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
What is it?

259
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:39,000
What is it?

260
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Don't touch it

261
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:53,000
The coldest women on earth

262
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,000
The coldest women on earth

263
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,000
The coldest women on earth

264
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Come closer

265
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:12,000
The coldest women on earth

266
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
The coldest women on earth

267
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Thank you

268
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Kokoriko Endo lied that she was attracted to the famous film director Harimoto

269
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,000
and called her to an audition

270
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:48,000
The biggest show is Samurai Hohohoi's Hohohoi

271
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Are you motivated? I saw something terrible, please leave

272
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Next person, please

273
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Hai

274
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Thank you for waiting

275
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:07,000
The late Hohohoi's actor Thomas MacLegar has arrived

276
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Please

277
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Konnichiwa tokyo

278
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Konnichiwa

279
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:23,000
And the audition is coming to an end

280
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Samurai Hohohoi's actor Thomas MacLegar has a homosexual wound

281
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Please play the role of Samurai Hohohoi

282
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Hai

283
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
No no no

284
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Why are you dressed like this?

285
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:48,000
No no no

286
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:54,000
No no no

287
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,000
What are you doing?

288
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
What are you doing?

289
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Sorry

290
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Who are you?

291
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Endo

292
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Endo

293
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,000
It's a big success

294
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,000
It's terrible

295
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
It's terrible

296
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:30,000
No.3 and No.2 are really good at acting

297
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,000
I was watching the show, but I didn't understand anything

298
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
I don't understand

299
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I don't understand

300
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Everything started with this man's words

301
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Recently I don't have much money

302
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
According to what I heard, Inse is a local, right?

303
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
That's right

304
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Yamasaki, who lives in Inse, wrote and composed the original songs for the four people in downtown Kokoriko

305
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:16,000
He started to produce all the arrangements, songs, and costumes

306
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:22,000
And this is the finished song

307
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:32,000
I always think of you when I was a kid

308
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:37,000
You are an actor

309
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
You are an actor

310
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,000
You are an actor

311
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
This is completely terrible

312
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:51,000
You are an actor

313
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
You are an actor

314
00:20:53,000 --> 00:21:21,000
It's funny

315
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
My song is in the middle of the town

316
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,000
In the middle of the town

317
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:52,000
In the middle of the town

318
00:21:52,000 --> 00:22:06,000
I don't understand

319
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I don't understand

320
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:17,000
I remember the second time I heard Tanaka's song

321
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I didn't hear Matsumoto's song

322
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:28,000
The last song Matsumoto sang was Pine Book

323
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
The last song of this year?

324
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Yes

325
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
That song?

326
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Yes

327
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:50,000
I can't go back

328
00:22:50,000 --> 00:23:07,000
I can't go back

329
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
I can't go back

330
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
I can't go back

331
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I can't go back

332
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
I can't go back

333
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:35,000
I can't go back

334
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:41,000
I can't go back
