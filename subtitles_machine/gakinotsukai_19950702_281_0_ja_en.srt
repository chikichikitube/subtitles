1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Let's do it!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Let's aim for the top!

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Glico Championship!

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Masao-san

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Yes?

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Takada is playing Glico

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Yes

8
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Why are we wearing heavy equipment?

9
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Well...

10
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
We have to wear heavy equipment

11
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Well...

12
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
It's because we're going to die

13
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
It's not because we're going to die

14
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I want to play with these guys

15
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Yes

16
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Here they are!

17
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
You can choose

18
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
You can sleep

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
You can sleep

20
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
You can wake up

21
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
You can wake up

22
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Here they are

23
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Look up!

24
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
We're going to use these stairs

25
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Let's play Glico

26
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
The first person to go up

27
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
There's a button on top

28
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
You press the button

29
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:03,000
And a gift will come down from the top

30
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I don't need that

31
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
But you have to know that you won't get hurt

32
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Who's going to get hurt?

33
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
So it means you won't get hurt

34
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Yes

35
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
You have to go up with Glico

36
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
It's like a tax avoidance

37
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
What does that mean?

38
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
It's not a loss

39
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
If you do that, everyone will know

40
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
This program is brought to you by the following sponsors

41
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Everyone

42
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
We have to play rock, paper, scissors with 6 people

43
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
One person only

44
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
That's right

45
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Wait a minute

46
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I feel like I've seen something

47
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
It's not that fun

48
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
It's not fun

49
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
It's not fun

50
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Shut up

51
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Let's go

52
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Rock, paper, scissors

53
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
It's hard to decide

54
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Rock, paper, scissors

55
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I got it

56
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Let's do the one with less

57
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Rock, paper, scissors

58
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
The one with less

59
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
It's me

60
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Pineapple

61
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I'm jealous

62
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
It's just this

63
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Rock, paper, scissors

64
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
It's me

65
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
But it's Furiko

66
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Furiko

67
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Rock, paper, scissors

68
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
It's me

69
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Glico

70
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Rock, paper, scissors

71
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
It's me

72
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Yamasaki

73
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Glico

74
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Rock, paper, scissors

75
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
It's me

76
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
It's the worst

77
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
It's the worst

78
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Rock, paper, scissors

79
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
It's me

80
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
It's me

81
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Wait a minute

82
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I don't think so

83
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I don't think so

84
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Why?

85
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Because you can't win

86
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Let's do rock, paper, scissors

87
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
You

88
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
You are like this

89
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
You should say it

90
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
How many fans do you have?

91
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Why are you doing that?

92
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Let's do the next one

93
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Rock, paper, scissors

94
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
It's me

95
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
It's you

96
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
It's the worst

97
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Pineapple

98
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Rock, paper, scissors

99
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
It's me

100
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
It's true

101
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
How can you win with scissors?

102
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Choclate

103
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Really?

104
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
You have a character

105
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Rock, paper, scissors

106
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
It's Suga

107
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
It's me

108
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Rock, paper, scissors

109
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
You look happy

110
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Rock, paper, scissors

111
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
It's me

112
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
It's me

113
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
It's Okamoto

114
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Choclate

115
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
It's the worst

116
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Wait a minute

117
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
It's the worst

118
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
There are so many items

119
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Are you stupid?

120
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
You should think about me

121
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
There are so many items

122
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Choclate

123
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Rock, paper, scissors

124
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
It's me

125
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
It's Okamoto

126
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Pineapple

127
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Rock, paper, scissors

128
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
It's me

129
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
It's Riko

130
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
It's Riko

131
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Rock, paper, scissors

132
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
It's a waste

133
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Do you want to use all the chocolates?

134
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
No

135
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
It's the same

136
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Rock, paper, scissors

137
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
It's me

138
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
It's me

139
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Pineapple

140
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
It's dangerous

141
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Rock, paper, scissors

142
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
It's over there

143
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Choclate

144
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
It's dangerous

145
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I'm sorry

146
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Rock, paper, scissors

147
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
It's me

148
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Pineapple

149
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Rock, paper, scissors

150
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
It's me

151
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
It's me

152
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Pineapple

153
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Rock, paper, scissors

154
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
What are you doing?

155
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Rock, paper, scissors

156
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
It's me

157
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Choclate

158
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
It's amazing

159
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,000
It's hard to see

160
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Rock, paper, scissors

161
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Rock, paper, scissors

162
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
It's me

163
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
It's dangerous

164
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Choclate

165
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Wait a minute

166
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
It's almost done

167
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
How many steps left?

168
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
3 steps

169
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
3 steps left?

170
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Yes

171
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
No matter how many steps

172
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
No matter how many steps

173
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,000
No matter how many steps

174
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Let's go

175
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
You are the first

176
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Yamasaki and Matsumoto are the first

177
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Where are you going?

178
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
What should I do?

179
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I want to be on camera

180
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I want to be on camera

181
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Let's go

182
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Rock, paper, scissors

183
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Pineapple

184
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
It's OK

185
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
It's dangerous

186
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Wait a minute

187
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Am I a baby?

188
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
You are a baby

189
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Rock, paper, scissors

190
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
It's me

191
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
No

192
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Wait

193
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I'm scared

194
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Wait

195
00:06:52,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Rock, paper, scissors

196
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
It's burning

197
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
It's hot

198
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:26,000
It's hot

199
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I'm scared

200
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I'm scared

201
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I'm scared

202
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I'm scared

203
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Why are you laughing?

204
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:48,000
From above, everyone is in a vertical position

205
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
It's dangerous

206
00:07:50,000 --> 00:08:08,000
It's dangerous

207
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
You can sing the opening song

208
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Why?

209
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I can still go

210
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:21,000
You can sing the opening song

211
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
You can laugh twice

212
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I can still go

213
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,000
There is another stupid song

214
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
There is another stupid song

215
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I was called out by Wada Akiyo

216
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I was called out by Wada Akiyo

217
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Why did you have to do that?

218
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
What did Wada Akiyo think about it?

219
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Did he see it?

220
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I changed my phone number to Wada Akiyo

221
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I told him what I wanted to change

222
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
He thought he could hug me

223
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
He thought he could be Matsumoto

224
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
He thought he could be Miyaku

225
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
He changed his phone number but he couldn't tell him

226
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:12,000
He thought he was Pinko

227
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,000
He had a red tail like a lipstick

228
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
You look like him

229
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:27,000
He sat like this but he came out like this

230
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
That's a dog's tail

231
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,000
He came to me

232
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
He came to me like this

233
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
This is bad

234
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Wait

235
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I can see the female part

236
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
This is scary

237
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I don't know

238
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I told him to come

239
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
That's what old men say

240
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
It's early in the morning

241
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I told him to come

242
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I told him I'm sorry

243
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
He said no

244
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
He said no

245
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Are you serious?

246
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I didn't ask

247
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Please forget about it

248
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Shut up

249
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I don't want to hear it

250
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I told him I can't do it anymore

251
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I ran out of battery

252
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I thought I was lucky

253
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I changed my phone number

254
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I thought he was going to get angry

255
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I thought he was going to get angry

256
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I told him I don't want to hear it

257
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Stop it

258
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
It's true

259
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
It's too much

260
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
You have to put up with it

261
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Ouch

262
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,000
It's too much

263
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
That's because it's a phone

264
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
If you call me somewhere

265
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I'll pull the car

266
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
If you call me somewhere

267
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I'll pull the car

268
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Stop it

269
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,000
What are you doing?

270
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Why are you laughing next to him?

271
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I did something wrong

272
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Please forgive me

273
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
That's what you're doing

274
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
If you do a show like that

275
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Stop it

276
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I don't want to hear it

277
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I can't hear it

278
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:20,000
It's like a message song

279
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
It's scary

280
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
But I told you

281
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I told you

282
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
About Hamada

283
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
No no no

284
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I thought he was going to get angry

285
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I'm not that kind of person

286
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Stop it

287
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:48,000
There are good places in Hamada and bad places in Matsumoto

288
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
They're both good

289
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
But in Hamada there are bad places

290
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I see

291
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
The reason is crazy

292
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
At that point

293
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
He's aiming at me

294
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
It doesn't matter if it's bad or good

295
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I'm going to eat

296
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Stop it

297
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I'm going to hide the camera like I did with Hajime

298
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I'm going to take a picture

299
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I've been kissed

300
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Wow

301
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I wonder if I complimented him

302
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:34,000
He's saying jori jori

303
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
It's an unknown world so I want to see it

304
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
It's scary

305
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I'm going to get on top

306
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I'm going to get on top

307
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Stop it

308
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I'm going to hit him more and more

309
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I'm going to get on top

310
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I'm going to blind him

311
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I'm going to grab him

312
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:08,000
If you're tied to the chain you can't escape

313
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
It's fine if you're tied

314
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
What are you talking about?

315
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I'm holding it from the back

316
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
If everyone goes out to eat and you notice

317
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
One person will be gone

318
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I'm going to go to the toilet

319
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Two people will be gone

320
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I think Akiyo will be like

321
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:38,000
One person will be gone

322
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:44,000
This is my way of doing things

323
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Matsumoto-san, I heard that you don't know what life is

324
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:53,000
What was the most dangerous thing you've ever done?

325
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I don't know what life is

326
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
You've never thought of it as scary

327
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
You've never heard of it as scary

328
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Today's opening was scary

329
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
What was that?

330
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
That's a different kind of scary

331
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:14,000
The most dangerous thing I've ever done

332
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,000
When I got bitten by a gorilla

333
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Where?

334
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Around here

335
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Bang!

336
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Where did you get that?

337
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I was playing baseball

338
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Where?

339
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
At the Grand

340
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Where?

341
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:39,000
At the Grand in Amagasaki

342
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I've never heard of that

343
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Then listen

344
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Bang!

345
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I'm a home run putter

346
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I'm a home run putter

347
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Are you stupid?

348
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I don't care

349
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Bang!

350
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I don't have a bowl

351
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Bang!

352
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I broke the glass

353
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I went to apologize

354
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:16,000
The gorilla was there

355
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
The gorilla was there?

356
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
There were two old men and a gorilla

357
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
There was a gorilla next to the old man?

358
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,000
What are you going to do about it?

359
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:32,000
The gorilla was like this

360
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
You're a gangster

361
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I was like this

362
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
And?

363
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I was like, what do you think?

364
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I was still a kid

365
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
The gorilla came out

366
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
It came out before

367
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
And?

368
00:16:53,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Why didn't you apologize?

369
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Did he talk?

370
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
The old man said it

371
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I was surprised

372
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
The old man said it

373
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,000
The old man said, why didn't you apologize?

374
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Hey, hey, hey

375
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Hey, hey, hey

376
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
The gorilla?

377
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Hey, hey, hey

378
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
The old man

379
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
What old man?

380
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
You talk a lot

381
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I said, okay

382
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I said, I won't apologize

383
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I said, I'll take revenge

384
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Bang!

385
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I took revenge

386
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Wait, wait

387
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Who is that?

388
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
The old man

389
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
The old man?

390
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:48,000
He comes out many times

391
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I said, let's put the gorilla in front of the old man

392
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I said, I'll avoid it

393
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
And then

394
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Bang!

395
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I don't know if it was a stone or a desk

396
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Are you licking the gorilla?

397
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
The gorilla

398
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:16,000
The old man

399
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
The old man

400
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
This is the gorilla

401
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
What?

402
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
You said it so lightly

403
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
That's the gorilla

404
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
This is the gorilla

405
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
This is the first time I've heard the gorilla

406
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
You don't look angry

407
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
The old man

408
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
This is the gorilla

409
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Oh

410
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Right?

411
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
The old man

412
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
You weren't surprised when the gorilla spoke

413
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
That wasn't strange

414
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I was shocked

415
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I thought it was strange

416
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I shouldn't have apologized

417
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I said, you're injured

418
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
You're from Kibuya

419
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
This is the gorilla

420
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
What?

421
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I'm not injured

422
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
And then

423
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Bang!

424
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I'm scared

425
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
It's this high

426
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
It's high

427
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Bang!

428
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
It's broken

429
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
The old man did it

430
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:22,000
What?

431
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Don't you live with the gorilla?

432
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,000
It has this much destructive power

433
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
It's fake

434
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
The old man said it

435
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:41,000
What?

436
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
It was a strange day

437
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
You weren't hit

438
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
I'm a 17-year-old man

439
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I'm the same height as Hamada

440
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:56,000
I'm 155 cm

441
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
That's fine

442
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
What should I do now

443
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I'm going to go over 2 meters like Matsumoto

444
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I'll teach you

445
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I'm going to go over 2 meters

446
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Dantan is

447
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
In other words

448
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
It's a big combination

449
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
It's amazing

450
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:17,000
You're taller than St. Louis

451
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Why can't I touch my face?

452
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
You can touch your face 2 meters

453
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,000
I don't do that

454
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Everyone is wrong

455
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
The way you measure

456
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
The way I measure

457
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Why?

458
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:38,000
I'm 170 cm

459
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
What do you think this 30 cm is?

460
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Of course

461
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
But this 30 cm

462
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
I don't care

463
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Why?

464
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
30 cm is what?

465
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
That's right

466
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:01,000
This is my heart

467
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:07,000
So my heart is 30 cm

468
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
You're a fool

469
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Do you understand?

470
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
You don't have a heart so you're attracted to me

471
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Everyone has one?

472
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Everyone has one

473
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
How many cm does everyone have?

474
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
It depends on the person

475
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
In my case, my heart is 30 cm

476
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,000
I want to feed you rice

477
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Don't panic

478
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
I want to feed you rice

479
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:37,000
What?

480
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Let me eat

481
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Say it

482
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,000
What?

483
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
You want to feed me rice?

484
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Of course

485
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
I always want to feed you rice

486
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Even when I'm talking to you

487
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Don't panic

488
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Even when I'm talking to you

489
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,000
I want to feed you rice

490
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Me?

491
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
I don't think so

492
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I never thought of you like that

493
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
When I'm talking to you

494
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I want to feed you rice

495
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I never thought of you like that

496
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Don't you understand?

497
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
That's why it's 155 cm

498
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Don't panic

499
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Don't panic

500
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Really?

501
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Of course

502
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
That's why it's 30 cm

503
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
To make it easier to understand

504
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:38,000
I always put a jar on my head

505
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
In my heart

506
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
In your heart

507
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
In my heart

508
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Whenever I open it

509
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
The steam comes out

510
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:51,000
The rice puffs up

511
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
I'm having a fight with my mother

512
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
It's a good story

513
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Sometimes you have to read this kind of letter

514
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
I haven't heard from you for three days

515
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I'm not bad

516
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
What should I do?

517
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,000
He's very serious

518
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
I haven't talked to you for about a month

519
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
I liked you

520
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
But you stole my erohon

521
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
I was so angry

522
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:22,000
And you cut it and made it into a file

523
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I just remembered

524
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:30,000
I still remember

525
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
When I was in elementary school

526
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
When I went to school

527
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
My friends told me

528
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
It's okay

529
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
It's okay

530
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
It's okay

531
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
It's okay

532
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
It's okay

533
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
It's okay

534
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
It's okay

535
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
It's okay

536
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
It's okay

537
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
It's okay

538
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:52,000
It's okay

539
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
In that moment

540
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
There was a mother

541
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
When I passed by

542
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,020
We did it!!
