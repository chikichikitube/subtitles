1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Manager Okamoto.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
His unceasing anger has taken over many of Ikuta's adventures.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
It has knocked us into the depths of fear.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
And now, once again...

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:00,120
The brief

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Manager Okamoto's anger!

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Umazuma-san.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Yes?

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
That's the one with 21.

10
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Ah, that's the one.

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
That's the one.

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
That's the one with 21.

13
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
That's the one with 21.

14
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
That's the one, right?

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
That's the one.

16
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
That's the one, right?

17
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I thought that was the one with 21.

18
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
So, what is it, SHUIMI-san?

19
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
What's your name, Okamoto-san?

20
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
How's Okamoto!?

21
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I've been calling you.

22
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Again?

23
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
So, you've been calling me?

24
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
No, it's not that, but...

25
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
You're not angry?

26
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Not much.

27
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Is it soft?

28
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
He's been calling me when he's not angry!

29
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Why have you been calling me?

30
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Where are you?

31
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Over here.

32
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Over here?

33
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Ah, inside the studio.

34
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
In the studio?

35
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:04,000
This program is brought to you by the following sponsors.

36
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Isn't there a place to shoot?

37
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Oh, there is.

38
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Huh?

39
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Oh, there he is.

40
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
What are you up to?

41
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Oh, good morning.

42
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Good morning.

43
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Hey, hey.

44
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Huh?

45
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I can't hear you.

46
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Hey.

47
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm here.

48
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm here for work.

49
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
What are you doing?

50
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Sorette Nittere.

51
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Sorette Nittere?

52
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
That's right.

53
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Many people have done it.

54
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Oh, I see.

55
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Sorette Nittere.

56
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm here.

57
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I'm here for work.

58
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
What do you mean?

59
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I'm here for work.

60
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
It's not me or Yamazaki.

61
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
It's not?

62
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I refuse that.

63
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Why do you refuse it?

64
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
You can't accept it.

65
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
You're not a talent.

66
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Sorette Nittere.

67
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Sorette Nittere is a Japanese TV program with many celebrities.

68
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Okamoto joins them.

69
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
It's one set today.

70
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Are you going to sleep together?

71
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I'm going to sleep together.

72
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
It's been a while.

73
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
It's been a while.

74
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Don't cry.

75
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
The person in charge is here.

76
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
The person in charge is here.

77
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Where?

78
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
That person.

79
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
He's the real one.

80
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
The real one?

81
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Sorette Nittere?

82
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
The person who made it.

83
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Oh, really?

84
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Is it okay?

85
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
It's not a talent.

86
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I think it's funny.

87
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I think it's funny.

88
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Is it really okay?

89
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Everyone, get ready.

90
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
This is the camera.

91
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
This is it.

92
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
It's the end of the take one.

93
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I'll do it right away.

94
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Let's go.

95
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Really.

96
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Ready.

97
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Yes.

98
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Sorette Nittere.

99
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Spring Special.

100
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Yes.

101
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
That's it.

102
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Okay, okay, okay.

103
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
That's it.

104
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
That's it.

105
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
That's good.

106
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
That's good.

107
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Damn it.

108
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
What's that?

109
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
It's okay now.

110
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
This is normal, right?

111
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Normal?

112
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Normal.

113
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Sorette Nittere.

114
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Then I'll do one more.

115
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Yes.

116
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Please do it again.

117
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Normal version.

118
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Ready.

119
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Yes.

120
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Sorette Nittere.

121
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Yes.

122
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
That's it.

123
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
The cat is perfect at the end.

124
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Yes.

125
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
That's it.

126
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Sorette Nittere.

127
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
It's perfect.

128
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
It was perfect.

129
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Thank you.

130
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Thank you.

131
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Wait a minute.

132
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
It's a happy job.

133
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Hey.

134
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Why are you doing that?

135
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Is this a good thing?

136
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Sorette Nittere.

137
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I'll do it.

138
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Everyone, be more nervous.

139
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Be more nervous.

140
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
There's something like this.

141
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Sorette Nittere.

142
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
The atmosphere was good.

143
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
You're the one who's in a bad mood, right?

144
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I got it.

145
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Yamasaki is good at this.

146
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
He gets hit and goes from the waist.

147
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
What do you want to do?

148
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Be more dangerous.

149
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
What do you want to do?

150
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Be more dangerous.

151
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I don't know.

152
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I don't know.

153
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Wait a minute.

154
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
You're a professional.

155
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
A big producer.

156
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
A big producer.

157
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
What's a big producer?

158
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I'm not a big producer.

159
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I'm not a big producer.

160
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Stop it.

161
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Stop it.

162
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I don't know.

163
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Shut up.

164
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I don't have a job.

165
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I don't know.

166
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Hey.

167
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I'm sorry.

168
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
It's funny.

169
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I know.

170
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I'll stop.

171
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I'll stop.

172
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I'll stop.

173
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I'll stop.

174
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I'll stop.

175
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I'll stop.

176
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I'll stop.

177
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I'll stop.

178
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I'll stop.

179
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I'll stop.

180
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I'll show you the bottom.

181
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Did you make the bottom?

182
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I made it.

183
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
It's underwater.

184
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I have to hold a fishing rod.

185
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I'll do it underwater.

186
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
It's funny.

187
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
You're drinking wine.

188
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
This is the first one.

189
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Is it like this?

190
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Yes.

191
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I don't think it's possible.

192
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Cool.

193
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Awesome.

194
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Put your feet on it.

195
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
A dolphin.

196
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I'm sorry.

197
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
It's a dolphin.

198
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
You can swim.

199
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
It's amazing.

200
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Why?

201
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
This is the first one.

202
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Cool.

203
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
You can hold it like this.

204
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Yes.

205
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
You'll do this?

206
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Yes.

207
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I'll hold a grumbler and a fishing rod.

208
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
And I'll do a waltz.

209
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Please do a waltz.

210
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I'll do this.

211
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
It's underwater.

212
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I prepared it.

213
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Really?

214
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Yes.

215
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
You're doing it again.

216
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
You're doing it again.

217
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
What do you do?

218
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
You go in.

219
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
You go in.

220
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
After 30 seconds.

221
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
You come out.

222
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
You do this.

223
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
You do that.

224
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
That's one.

225
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
You do this.

226
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
You do that.

227
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
You do that.

228
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Can you do that?

229
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Yes, I can.

230
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I can do that.

231
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
It's a little hard.

232
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
He's saying it's hard.

233
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I'll do a waltz.

234
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I'll do a waltz.

235
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
You have to have a sense of crisis.

236
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
You have to have a sense of crisis.

237
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
You have to have a sense of crisis.

238
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
That's right.

239
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
You're risking your life.

240
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I understand.

241
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I'll leave it to you.

242
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Yes.

243
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I'll start from Shizuoka.

244
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
What?

245
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Are you ready?

246
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I'm ready.

247
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
You have to have a sense of crisis.

248
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
You have to be strong.

249
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
You have to be strong.

250
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
You have to be strong.

251
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
You have to run.

252
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
You have to run.

253
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I'm not running.

254
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I don't know what to do.

255
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I don't know what to do.

256
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I don't know what to do.

257
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
You have to be strong.

258
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
You're a good guy.

259
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Are you ready, Okamoto?

260
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Let's go.

261
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Ready.

262
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Start.

263
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
You look terrible.

264
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Are you trying to get up?

265
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
You're not good at all.

266
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
You look like a man.

267
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
You look like a man.

268
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
You look like a man.

269
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Look at your face.

270
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Let's go.

271
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Ready.

272
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Start.

273
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
What are you doing?

274
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
There's still 15 seconds left.

275
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
10 seconds.

276
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
10 seconds left.

277
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
10 seconds left.

278
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
10 seconds left.

279
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I'm sorry.

280
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I'm sorry.

281
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Wait.

282
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I'll do it.

283
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Okamoto.

284
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
You did it in 30 seconds.

285
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
You have to say it properly.

286
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Yes.

287
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
You have to say it properly.

288
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
You have to say it properly.

289
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Ready.

290
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Start.

291
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
It's hard to get down.

292
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
It's hard.

293
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
15 seconds.

294
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
5.

295
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
4.

296
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
3.

297
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
2.

298
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
My nose is running.

299
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:13,000
My nose is running.

300
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Okamoto.

301
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Your nose is running.

302
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I can't hear you.

303
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
You're pathetic.

304
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
This is the last one.

305
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Yes.

306
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Ready.

307
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Start.

308
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
5 seconds.

309
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
4.

310
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
3.

311
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
2.

312
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
1.

313
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Go.

314
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
You did it.

315
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Okamoto.

316
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Good job.

317
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I don't want to say it.

318
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Okamoto, do it.

319
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Let's go.

320
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Let's go.

321
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Let's go home.

322
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Thank you.

323
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Hello.

324
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Why are you laughing?

325
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I'm not laughing.

326
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
The audience is fine.

327
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
They are fine.

328
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
But you know what?

329
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
What?

330
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
The hub is hard.

331
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
The hub?

332
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Do you want to talk about the hub?

333
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I don't have much data.

334
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
It's ok.

335
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
What is it?

336
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
You know what?

337
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
My woman was kicked by a ***.

338
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I don't like it.

339
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
That's because there are a lot of people.

340
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
There are things like that.

341
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I don't know what's going to happen.

342
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I don't know what's going to happen.

343
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I think I should go and call her.

344
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
That's impossible.

345
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I was worried about that.

346
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I felt sorry for her.

347
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I'm a wolf.

348
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
What are you?

349
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Lonely wolf.

350
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
How old are you?

351
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
How old are you?

352
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
What are you doing?

353
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Basically, I don't get kicked by people.

354
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,000
There are mothers and fathers like that.

355
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
But they are not my real parents.

356
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
You look like them.

357
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I was born with a backache.

358
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
You don't look like your parents.

359
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
It doesn't matter.

360
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I didn't run away.

361
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I just happened to run into them.

362
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
For example, the guy with glasses?

363
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
It doesn't matter.

364
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
If he runs away, I'll beat him up.

365
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
You're the only one who can do that.

366
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I see.

367
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I'll tell him to stop.

368
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I'll tell him that.

369
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I'll ask him what he's doing.

370
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I'll stab him.

371
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
He said that.

372
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I'm the guy with glasses, right?

373
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Yes, you are.

374
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I'm the guy with glasses.

375
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Don't lie to me.

376
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I can't do anything.

377
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I can't even tell him to stop.

378
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I'm the guy with glasses.

379
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I don't care if he stabs me or not.

380
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
It's a two-step process.

381
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Don't lie to me.

382
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
You don't know anything.

383
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
He'll stab you if you get close to him.

384
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
It doesn't matter.

385
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I can't do anything.

386
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
But you were hit by your own woman.

387
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I shouldn't be angry.

388
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Your bones are broken.

389
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I always hit them.

390
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Why?

391
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I hit them.

392
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I hit them.

393
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
What kind of situation is this?

394
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
How should I put it?

395
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
It's an expression of love.

396
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
It's like this.

397
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Instead of that,

398
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
it's like this.

399
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
What?

400
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
There's a high-spirited expression.

401
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,000
It's like this.

402
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
A woman should be calm.

403
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I'm not calm.

404
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I have a lot of scars.

405
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,000
You have scars?

406
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I have a lot of scars.

407
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Don't you think about what to do if you get hit?

408
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I do.

409
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I don't know what to do.

410
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I don't know what to do.

411
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I met her somewhere in Shinjuku.

412
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I was walking and she was following me.

413
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I was waiting for the traffic light.

414
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
There were two people.

415
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I could hear them.

416
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
What should I do?

417
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Should I stab her?

418
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Should I stab her?

419
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
No way.

420
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I was doing it normally.

421
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
You weren't doing this.

422
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I was doing it normally.

423
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I was doing it normally.

424
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Should I stab her?

425
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I don't know what to do.

426
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
It's mostly a blade.

427
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I don't understand that.

428
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
You don't understand that?

429
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
What about a windmill?

430
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
It's fine.

431
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I can stab a windmill on the back.

432
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Let's try to find the windmill.

433
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Let's just run.

434
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
What kind of death do you have to do in order to be released?

435
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
If there is something clearly wrong, you will be released.

436
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
By appearance?

437
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
By appearance.

438
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:14,000
For example, an elite salaried man of some class was killed.

439
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Right? At this point... Ah, he was killed?

440
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
He was killed?

441
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
If he was killed, you will understand.

442
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
You will understand why he died.

443
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
He was dead when he woke up in the morning.

444
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
At this point, there is no need to release him.

445
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
That's why you should investigate why he died.

446
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
That's because he didn't wake up in the morning.

447
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
No, no, no.

448
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
No, no, no.

449
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
You can't wake him up in the morning.

450
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
You should investigate why he died.

451
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
No, no, you already know that.

452
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
He was sleeping.

453
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
He was sleeping, and he just left.

454
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
So the reason he left is...

455
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
That's a sixth-degree sleep.

456
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
In a sense.

457
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Rather than a second-degree sleep...

458
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
It's not a second-degree sleep or a third-degree sleep.

459
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
It's a sixth-degree sleep.

460
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Right.

461
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
At this point, there is no need to release him.

462
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
But if you look at him...

463
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
He was wearing a bra.

464
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
That's strange.

465
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
You should try to release him.

466
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Do you understand?

467
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
There's no way I understand.

468
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Let's keep that a secret.

469
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Why?

470
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
He was wearing a bra, so it's not good to release him.

471
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
It's too pitiful.

472
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
It's strange.

473
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
He was wearing a bra.

474
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
It's strange, but...

475
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Let's keep that a secret.

476
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
But it's strange.

477
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
It's obviously strange.

478
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
It's strange.

479
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
But if you don't clean it up as a hobby...

480
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
He was wearing a bra, so I'll release him.

481
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:36,000
That's the feeling of a family member.

482
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
But...

483
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Your father was wearing a bra?

484
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Don't say that.

485
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
It's pitiful.

486
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
But if he was wearing a bra...

487
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
As a family member, you'd be worried.

488
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Your father.

489
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
When your father takes something expensive...

490
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
He'll fix it later.

491
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
It's obviously strange.

492
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Let's keep that a secret.

493
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
But it's not like...

494
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
It's not like he understood it after he died.

495
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
If you look at his daily life...

496
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
He'll do this when he does this.

497
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,000
He must have realized that his father was strange recently.

498
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
If he was wearing a bra, it's fine.

499
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Maybe before the police came...

500
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Everyone was taking off their bras.

501
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
You can't show this.

502
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
His family?

503
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
His family.

504
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
But there's a mark.

505
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
You can't wear bras like that.

506
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I don't know why.

507
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
But bras are fine.

508
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Don't take off your bras.

509
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I won't.

510
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Someone's station manager was killed.

511
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Right?

512
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
You can't be killed.

513
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Your boss...

514
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
The station manager died in the station manager's chair.

515
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
He died peacefully.

516
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I don't know why.

517
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
He died like this.

518
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
You can't be killed.

519
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
If you do this, you're not Kiri anymore.

520
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
That's not the problem.

521
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
But from the station manager's nose...

522
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,000
The collar was sticking out.

523
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:03,000
It's not a collar.

524
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,000
It was sticking out from the station manager's nose.

525
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
This is strange.

526
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
That's strange.

527
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
That's strange.

528
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,000
If it was sticking out from one side, I would've put it in.

529
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
But it's sticking out from both sides.

530
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Where's the inside?

531
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
It's alive.

532
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
It's alive?

533
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I'm scared.

534
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I'm scared.

535
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I'll go get it.

536
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
It's cold, Matsumoto-san.

537
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Is that it?

538
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
How to get warm without a stove?

539
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
How to get warm without a stove?

540
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
There's that.

541
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Please tell us.

542
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
It's yesterday.

543
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I see.

544
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Yesterday, everyone was walking around saying it was cold.

545
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I'm cold in a way, but I don't think I'm cold in a way.

546
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Which is it?

547
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:13,000
It's cold, but I don't think I'm cold in a way.

548
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
So...

549
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
So what?

550
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
What are you trying to end with?

551
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Give her a key holder.

552
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I don't have one.

553
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I don't have a key holder.

554
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Downtown key holder.

555
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I don't have one.

556
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I don't have one.

557
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Matsumoto-san,

558
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Please tell us a way to get a key holder that you can't figure out.

559
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
This.

560
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
This is...

561
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
It's nothing.

562
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,000
There is a perfect place to get it.

563
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
It can't be found.

564
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
It can't be found.

565
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Isn't that good?

566
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,000
The key holder can be found by peeping.

567
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
I see.

568
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Don't peek.

569
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
It's a respect.

570
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Don't peek, don't peek, don't sleep.

571
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I can't sleep.

572
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I'm sick of it.

573
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I'm sick of it.

574
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,000
When I was in high school, there was a guy who was really smart.

575
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
His name was Miyoshi.

576
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
That's why he didn't write Matsumoto Hitoshi.

577
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,000
He wrote Miyoshi instead.

578
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
He wrote Matsumoto and Kake for Miyoshi.

579
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Matsumoto Hitoshi got 90 points.

580
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
So what about Miyoshi?

581
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Miyoshi only got 20 points.

582
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
No way.

583
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
But if Matsumoto is good, it's all OK.

584
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
I wonder.

585
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,000
I was listening to this and thought it was AI.

586
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Do you know that?

587
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
How to win a marathon.

588
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Do you know?

589
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Who are you listening to?

590
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
1500, trunk, that.

591
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Trunk?

592
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
It's a truck.

593
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
It's a truck.

594
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
It's a truck with four laps.

595
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Do you know how to win a 1500 marathon?

596
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
I don't know.

597
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Start.

598
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Start.

599
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Start.

600
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Start.

601
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Start.

602
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Start.

603
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Start.

604
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Start.

605
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:30,000
There's no way it's a guy who has no stamina.

606
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Why do you look so far?

607
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:40,000
I was looking at the picture when I was in perfect shape.

608
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,000
For a woman, I have a question for Matsumoto Teio who is said to have beaten up Ms. Umemiya.

609
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,000
I sometimes call her by the name of the woman I'm cheating on.

610
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
It becomes a very bad atmosphere.

611
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,000
There's no way to call her by her name correctly.

612
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:03,000
When you're dating multiple women, you can't call her by her name.

613
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I see.

614
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,000
If you call her Keiko or Yoshiko, it's a mistake.

615
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
You have to unify them.

616
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Anything is fine.

617
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
For example, Nikita.

618
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
You can't call her by her name.

619
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
You can't call her by her name.

620
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Right?

621
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
You can't call her by her name.

622
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
You can't call her by her name.

623
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Why Nikita?

624
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
There are many other names.

625
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
For-e-va.

626
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
I understand the meaning.

627
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
For-e-va.

628
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
You have to unify them.

629
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
That's for sure.

630
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
I'll be honest with you.

631
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
I'll only call her by her name.

632
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Why are you laughing?

633
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
I'm a little embarrassed.

634
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
But it's wrong to call her by her name.

635
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
You have to match her.

636
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
You have to match her.

637
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
You have to match her.

638
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Nikita.

639
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
You have to match her.

640
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:11,000
The problem is that when you call her Nikita, and she finds out,

641
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
you have to talk to her.

642
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:19,000
I understand Nikita, but I don't know how Nikita feels.

643
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:25,000
When that happens, you have to call her by her name.

644
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
You can't call her by her name.

645
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:34,000
You have to match her.

646
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,000
The problem is that when you call her Nikita, and she finds out,

647
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
you have to match her.

648
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,000
I understand Nikita, but I don't know how Nikita feels.

649
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
How do you call her?

650
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
How do you call your wife?

651
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:59,000
I'll call her by her name.

652
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
You're scary!

653
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
You're scary!

654
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Do you want to get bitten?

655
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Say it like that!

656
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Say it like that!
