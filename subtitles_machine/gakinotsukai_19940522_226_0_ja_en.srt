1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Gakki no Tsukai, the usual Gakuhyaku scenery

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I went to have a drink yesterday

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Good morning

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I'm a little worried today

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
What room is it?

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Please come in

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Busy

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
It's just a little

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Do you have a bento?

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
You have to drink the bento staff

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Don't say that here

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Hamada said to eat a bento

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm sorry

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
You're a bad guy

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
What

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Why are you saying that?

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'm a senior

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm angry

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
What are you angry about?

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I'm angry

21
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm angry

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm angry

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm angry

24
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'm angry

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Why are you saying that?

26
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Various human shapes are on the stage of the entertainment world

27
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Jealousy, jealousy, confrontation

28
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Decorate the backstage of the entertainer

29
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Yamazaki Hosei, the fastest to cut off in the entertainment world

30
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Jimmy Onishi, who doesn't know what's scary when it's cut

31
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Inside the power to leave a deep impression on the back of this smile

32
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Now, the first in a lifetime

33
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
The battle of human rights in the entertainment world

34
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
This program is provided by the sponsor you are watching

35
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
What is it?

36
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
It's natural

37
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I'm not natural

38
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Are you really calculating?

39
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
What

40
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Do you think about the story even when you're alone?

41
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Why are you doing that?

42
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
What are you doing?

43
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Don't put your hand out

44
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Wait a minute

45
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
What did you do?

46
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Stop it

47
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Stop it

48
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Don't put your hand out

49
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
What are you doing?

50
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
What is this?

51
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
What is this?

52
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Don't put your hand out

53
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Don't put your hand out

54
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
It's useless

55
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Stop it

56
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
What do you mean?

57
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Wait a minute

58
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Which one is faster?

59
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Which one is faster?

60
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Which one is faster?

61
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Which one will you follow?

62
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Which one will you follow?

63
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
We're all in the same company

64
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
It may be strange, but I'm a senior

65
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Don't do that

66
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
You have to talk to me properly

67
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Why?

68
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I don't recognize you

69
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
If you know, tell me

70
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Do you recognize me?

71
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I recognize you

72
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
What?

73
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I recognize you, so you should recognize me too

74
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I recognize you because you're a senior

75
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
If you have a problem with me, I'll solve it

76
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Don't say that

77
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Don't say that

78
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Don't say that

79
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I've been watching you for a long time

80
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I think you have the final power

81
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
It's okay

82
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Let's see

83
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Let's see which one can do it

84
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
You're strong

85
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
You can drink goldfish

86
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:43,000
You can drink goldfish

87
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Hey

88
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
You can drink it

89
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Go into the bath

90
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
What

91
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Ichiro

92
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Yamazaki!

93
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
What are you doing?

94
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
He's drinking salt water.

95
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Yamazaki!

96
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Huh?

97
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
What are you doing?

98
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
You're spilling water.

99
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
It's really small.

100
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:42,000
What are you doing?

101
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
It's hot!

102
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
It's like he's going to give birth.

103
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
You can't do that.

104
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
If it's Yamazaki, I can drink it all at once.

105
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
What are you talking about?

106
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
My Jimmy can drink it all at once.

107
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Yamazaki, are you crying?

108
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
No, I'm not.

109
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I hate milk.

110
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Let's go!

111
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Ready...

112
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Start!

113
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
It's hot!

114
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Can you win?

115
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I can't drink it.

116
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Yamazaki, what's with your left hand?

117
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
It's like he's going to give birth.

118
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I don't like it.

119
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I don't like it either.

120
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
What are you talking about?

121
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Can you do it?

122
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I can't.

123
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I can't do it.

124
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
If you want to do it, you can do it.

125
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I can do it.

126
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I can't.

127
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
My Yamazaki is good at...

128
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Kawa-ra-wari!

129
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
What?

130
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
What are you talking about?

131
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Didn't you know?

132
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
My Jimmy can do it.

133
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I can't do it.

134
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
My Jimmy is sweating.

135
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Yamazaki!

136
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Yamazaki!

137
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Yamazaki!

138
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
In this program, there are two episodes.

139
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
We'll see how today's guests feel.

140
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
We'll see how today's guests feel.

141
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Today's guests are very strict.

142
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
You guys win or we win.

143
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
It's a short time, but thank you for watching.

144
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
What did you say?

145
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
My last words.

146
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
You're so rude.

147
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
What?

148
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
What is that?

149
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
What?

150
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I can't talk.

151
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
What is this?

152
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
It's a salon pass.

153
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I don't know if it's a salon pass.

154
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
What is this?

155
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
What?

156
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
You have to put it on.

157
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I can't put it on.

158
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I put it on here.

159
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Why?

160
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
If it's hard, my head hurts.

161
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
You have to put it on before the show.

162
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
How many times have you been a strict guest?

163
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
It depends on the guest.

164
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
If I take it off, it hurts.

165
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
You have a hole.

166
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
You don't talk.

167
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
This is not a hole.

168
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
What is this?

169
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
You can contact me anytime.

170
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
What kind of contact?

171
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Who contacted you?

172
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I received it.

173
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Then take it out more.

174
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I received it.

175
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
It's not two.

176
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
It's not two.

177
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
It's not two.

178
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Wait a minute.

179
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
It's about eight.

180
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
The real one is one.

181
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
There's nothing else.

182
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
It's a movie.

183
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
You're rude.

184
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Don't talk about money.

185
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Everyone knows that you have money.

186
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
You told me.

187
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
You're not making money.

188
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I'm not making money.

189
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I'm not making money.

190
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I'm not making money at all.

191
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Everyone is cheating.

192
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I'm just explaining.

193
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I'm just being honest.

194
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I'm just being honest.

195
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Why did you get a shoulder massage?

196
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I'm a movie star.

197
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I'm a movie star.

198
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I'm a movie star.

199
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I'm a movie star.

200
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I'm a movie star.

201
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
What do you mean?

202
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

203
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

204
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I said that I was a movie star.

205
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I'm not doing anything.

206
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I'm not doing anything.

207
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I know that.

208
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I don't think I'm losing to Yoshiko Mita.

209
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
That's what I said.

210
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
No, no, no.

211
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I said that this is not good.

212
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
But how can I save money?

213
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
For example, let's say a thief comes in.

214
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
He took a lot of money.

215
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
But the tax money doesn't come in.

216
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
That doesn't matter.

217
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
But it's strange.

218
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
He took the money.

219
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
He doesn't have money, so he can't be paid.

220
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
He can't do anything about it.

221
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
For example, I'm walking down the street.

222
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Let's say I was robbed on Sunday or something.

223
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Wait, wait, wait.

224
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Let's stop Sunday for now.

225
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Let's stop Sunday for now.

226
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Let's go somewhere nice.

227
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Let's go somewhere nice.

228
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I don't care.

229
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
He's a bad junior high school student.

230
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
He's in third grade.

231
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Are you talking about junior high school students?

232
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
He's in third grade of junior high school.

233
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
He's in the military school tomorrow morning.

234
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Stop laughing like an old lady.

235
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
He's surrounded by such a guy.

236
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
That's scary.

237
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
You have money too.

238
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
What money?

239
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
No, no, no, it's money, it's money.

240
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

241
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
It's all square.

242
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I can see it now.

243
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I can't tell with the silhouette.

244
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
It's all in the air.

245
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
What are you talking about?

246
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
It's all in the air.

247
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I'm getting dizzy.

248
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
It's all in the air.

249
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
So if you take all of it,

250
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
and if you say you're going to make money,

251
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I can't do anything about it.

252
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
But I get my taxes, right?

253
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
That's true.

254
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
That's weird.

255
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
It's definitely weird.

256
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
First of all,

257
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
why do you have to take half of it?

258
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Explain it to me.

259
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Well, if you say that,

260
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
it's like that.

261
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
It's like that.

262
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I don't have any money.

263
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
People say I have a lot of money,

264
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
but I don't have any money at all.

265
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I have a one-week break now,

266
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
so I'm going to use that

267
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
to buy Dunkin' Donuts or something.

268
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Do you get it?

269
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I'm going to take these guys,

270
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
and I'm going to show them my heart.

271
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Right?

272
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
You're going to be in trouble if you go.

273
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Which one are you going to choose?

274
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Are you going to do it like that?

275
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I'll do it.

276
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I'll do it.

277
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
But really,

278
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:33,000
it's not as much as you think.

279
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
But more than half of it

280
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
is going to be taken away.

281
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
But if it's like this,

282
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
if it's number one next year,

283
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I'll take it.

284
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Really.

285
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Your target isn't even in the top 20.

286
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Oh, really?

287
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Your target is already out of the top 20?

288
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
It's already out.

289
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I'm going to be number one.

290
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Really?

291
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I'm going to take out Yoshiko Mita.

292
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I didn't do anything to that woman.

293
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:01,000
That's what I'm saying.

294
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I said I shouldn't do it.

295
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
You tricked me.

296
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
But really,

297
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I don't have any money, so...

298
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
So...

299
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Umm...

300
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Oh, right.

301
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
What? What?

302
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Who are you talking to?

303
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
What are you doing?

304
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Give me back my 3,000 yen.

305
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Give me back my 3,000 yen.

306
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I said I don't need it.

307
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
It's okay. You don't need it, so give me back my 3,000 yen.

308
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I don't need it.

309
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
3,000 yen doesn't hurt that much for you.

310
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
You don't need it either.

311
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
But give it back to me.

312
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I don't need it.

313
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I'll give you 5,000 yen, so give me back my 3,000 yen.

314
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Is that okay?

315
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I've been saying this for five years.

316
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
This is the end, right?

317
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Give me back my 3,000 yen.

318
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I'm serious.

319
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Why are you so angry?

320
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I said I don't need it.

321
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Where are you going?

322
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Give me your wallet.

323
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Seriously.

324
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Give me your wallet.

325
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Give me your wallet.

326
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I don't have any money in my wallet.

327
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
It's okay. You can bring it to me.

328
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
You have 3,000 yen, right?

329
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I wonder if I have it.

330
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
But I won't give it back to you.

331
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I won't give it back to you.

332
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:41,000
In Nagasaki, when I went to buy clothes with you,

333
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
you said you wanted a T-shirt.

334
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
But you said you didn't have any money,

335
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:51,000
so you held your head up at the emergency stairs and did this.

336
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
No, no.

337
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
That was when I was in Kyoto Kage.

338
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Kyoto Kage is different.

339
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I lent you money at that time, so please give it back to me.

340
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
No.

341
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,000
When I was in Kyoto Kage, I lent it to you.

342
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I lent it to you.

343
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I don't know anyone.

344
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
It's okay. You have 3,000 yen.

345
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
No, no.

346
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Give it back to me.

347
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I'll give it back to you.

348
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
No, no.

349
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Wait a minute.

350
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Wait a minute.

351
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Why didn't you take my money?

352
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,000
It's really 3,000 yen.

353
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Well, okay, okay,

354
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
tell me then.

355
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
3,000 yen, really...

356
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
It's okay if it's not that much,

357
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
you have exactly the same amount as 4,000 yen.

358
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,000
But this, I don't need it anymore.

359
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Oh, I see.

360
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
The same amount as 4,000 yen?

361
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Thank you very much.

362
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
You're exactly what I need.

363
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I'm going to take this back.

364
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:01,000
What are you doing with the money?

365
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I'll take it back.

366
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
No, I'm serious.

367
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I'll take this back.

368
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I'll take it back.

369
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I'm not going to do it again.

370
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:22,000
No, I'm serious.

371
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I have a lot of other juice.

372
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I'm the one who said that.

373
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:38,000
When I was in junior high school, I was angry with you twice.

374
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,000
When I was in junior high school, I was angry with you twice.

375
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Isn't it worth about 100 yen?

376
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
That's amazing.

377
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
You're a fool.

378
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,000
If it was 100 yen at that time, it would be amazing.

379
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I'll take this back.

380
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I'll take this back.

381
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Isn't that printing strange?

382
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Printing is strange.

383
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I'll take this back.

384
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I have a lot of money.

385
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I'll give you 100,000 yen if you don't take it back.

386
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
You don't have it, do you?

387
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
I think I have it.

388
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
You don't have it.

389
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I'll give you 100,000 yen if you don't take it back.

390
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Where's my money?

391
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Give it back to me.

392
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
You can't just give me 3,000 yen.

393
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Why do you care so much about 3,000 yen?

394
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Where's my money?

395
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I'll take this.

396
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Which one?

397
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
This one.

398
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I have a lot of money.

399
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I missed this.

400
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I have this all the time.

401
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:19,000
You're a fool.

402
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Are you a child?

403
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,000
My hands are full of your saliva.

404
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I have 7,000 yen, so give me back 10,000 yen.

405
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,000
You don't have it, do you?

406
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I only have 1,000 yen.

407
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I don't have money.

408
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
I don't have money.

409
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
OK.

410
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,000
I can feel good with this.

411
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Take it to me.

412
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I found a video of a child using it 4 years ago and watched it for 6 hours.

413
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Then I realized that the attitude of the two of you is completely different from 4 years ago and now.

414
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I don't think so.

415
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I wonder if the audience thinks so, too.

416
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,000
I don't think so.

417
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I'm not talking about you.

418
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I'm serious.

419
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
I'm not modest at all.

420
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
The eyes of the world are wrong.

421
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I'm not the kind of person you think I am.

422
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
It's different.

423
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
What's different?

424
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
When I go home, I don't go straight home.

425
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,000
I go to a child care center.

426
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I wear an umbrella when it rains.

427
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:01,000
I'm the kind of person who does that.

428
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I don't have money.

429
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I have a license.

430
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
What kind of license?

431
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I don't have a license.

432
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
It's a matter of feeling.

433
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,000
I have a kind license.

434
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Are you stupid?

435
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
It's a matter of feeling.

436
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
What kind of license do I have?

437
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Is it your kind of license?

438
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
It's not my kind of license.

439
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
It's different.

440
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
What are you talking about?

441
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
It's my kind of license.

442
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
It's your kind of license.

443
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
It's your kind of license.

444
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,000
I just want to say it because it feels good.

445
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
You said the same thing today.

446
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Why did you say it twice?

447
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:52,000
I thought about it.

448
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
You said it twice because it felt good.

449
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Are you stupid?

450
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
It's a kind of license.

451
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,000
I'm laughing, but I'll tell you when I get home.

452
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
You want to say it now, don't you?

453
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
It's a kind of license.

454
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
You should definitely say it when you get home.

455
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
What do you want to say?

456
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
You should definitely say it when you get home.

457
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
It's a kind of license.

458
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
I'm looking forward to it.

459
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Can you pierce this toothpick through here?

460
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
