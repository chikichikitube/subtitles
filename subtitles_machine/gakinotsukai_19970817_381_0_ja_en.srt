1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I've noticed something new.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
For example, you go to a cafe, right?

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
You come here, right?

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
You order something, anything is fine.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
When you're about to go home, right?

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
When you're about to go home, you call for something.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
If you call for something and say,

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I have a cigarette,

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
it will definitely spin.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
It will definitely spin.

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
No matter how many times you do it,

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
it will definitely spin.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
This program is brought to you by the following sponsors.

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:56,000
In the first episode of Gaki no Tsukai Yaranen, Chiki Chiki Maashite Maashite Ichiban!

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
The teacher, Mr. Matsumoto...

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
The teacher, Mr. Matsumoto...

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
You're desperate, aren't you?

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
You need to relax more.

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The teacher, Mr. Matsumoto...

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Why are you laughing?

21
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Mr. Matsumoto said it, right?

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
He said it.

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
During the talk,

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
he went to the coffee shop and said,

25
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm sorry.

26
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
If you say that, it will definitely spin.

27
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Whether it's true or not,

28
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I want to enjoy it as if I'm playing a game.

29
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
That's what he said.

30
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
We have two coffee shops ready,

31
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
but we're only telling the owners about this.

32
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The staff won't know at all.

33
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Then, Mr. Don Tan, Mr. Kokori,

34
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
please disperse.

35
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I can't say it at all.

36
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Then Hamada and I will do this.

37
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Yes, disperse.

38
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Oh, like this?

39
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Yes.

40
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Who will do it?

41
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Ready, go!

42
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Matsumoto Endo Team,

43
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Hamada Tanaka Team.

44
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I don't like Endo.

45
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Why?

46
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Mr. Matsumoto, let's spin it.

47
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Then, Mr. Hamada Team will do it.

48
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
That's fine.

49
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
What is the shop like?

50
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
It looks like this.

51
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
This is the data.

52
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
This is a home-like atmosphere

53
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
that the owner of the shop doesn't like.

54
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Here it is.

55
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
A shop that doesn't allow compromise.

56
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
It's here.

57
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Why?

58
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
It's the opposite.

59
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Which way should we go?

60
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Let's go this way.

61
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
But if you think about the motto of this shop,

62
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
it's a home-like atmosphere that the owner doesn't like.

63
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Then, let's compromise.

64
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I think this one is better.

65
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Endo is better.

66
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Hey, wait a minute.

67
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I think this one is better.

68
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I don't think it will spin.

69
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I don't think so.

70
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I don't think so.

71
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
It's here.

72
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
It's here.

73
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Then, Hamada Team.

74
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
You're not sitting down, are you?

75
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I'm sitting down.

76
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Start.

77
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Start.

78
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I'm sorry.

79
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Thank you.

80
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I'm sorry.

81
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
It doesn't spin.

82
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
It doesn't spin.

83
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
It doesn't spin.

84
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
It doesn't spin.

85
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Is it okay to order only drinks?

86
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Yes, it's okay.

87
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Why is it okay?

88
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Is it okay?

89
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Then, I'll think about it.

90
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I'm sorry.

91
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
It doesn't spin at all.

92
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I'm surprised.

93
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I'll order drinks.

94
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
It's not good to sit down.

95
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
It's not good.

96
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Orange juice.

97
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Yes.

98
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
It doesn't spin.

99
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
It doesn't spin.

100
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
It doesn't spin.

101
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
It says it doesn't spin.

102
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Really?

103
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
It spins the other way.

104
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
It doesn't spin.

105
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
It spins the other way.

106
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
That's why.

107
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
When it goes like this, it spins to the left.

108
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
It spins.

109
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Don't shake your hand like that.

110
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
That's right.

111
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
That's right.

112
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
If you get 100,000 yen like that, you can earn as much money as you want.

113
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
You just have to look back.

114
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
It doesn't spin.

115
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I wonder if it's just a lie.

116
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I'm sorry.

117
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I'm sorry.

118
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I'm sorry.

119
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I'm sorry.

120
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I'm sorry.

121
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I'm sorry.

122
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I'm sorry.

123
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
It hasn't spun yet.

124
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
It spins to the left.

125
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
It doesn't spin.

126
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
It doesn't spin.

127
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
It doesn't spin.

128
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
It doesn't spin to the left.

129
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
It doesn't spin.

130
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Don't say it out loud.

131
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Don't say it out loud.

132
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Oh, you got a penalty.

133
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Excuse me.

134
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
This is the timing.

135
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
It's spinning now.

136
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Did it spin?

137
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Yes, it finally spun once.

138
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Excuse me.

139
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
It's spinning now.

140
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Excuse me.

141
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Wait a minute.

142
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Excuse me.

143
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
It's too late.

144
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Just say it out loud.

145
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Okay.

146
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
It's spinning now.

147
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
It's really hard.

148
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I understand.

149
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I'm sorry.

150
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
You'll understand when you see mine.

151
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I'll spin with my toes.

152
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
You're kidding.

153
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Let's eat and go home.

154
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
He gave up.

155
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
He gave up.

156
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
He gave up.

157
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
It's perfect.

158
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Let's eat and go home.

159
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
What do you mean go home?

160
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I can't even go to the bathroom.

161
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
What are you talking about?

162
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
You can't do that.

163
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
That's harsh.

164
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
That's harsh.

165
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I'm not playing anymore.

166
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Let's enjoy the game.

167
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Yagami.

168
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Yes.

169
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
We have to play next.

170
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
We have to eat.

171
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I'm not hungry.

172
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
What are you thinking?

173
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I'm working.

174
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Let's enjoy the game.

175
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I'm going.

176
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I'm hungry.

177
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Excuse me.

178
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Yes.

179
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Okay.

180
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:28,000
You're fast.

181
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I'm sorry.

182
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I told you to go home.

183
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
What?

184
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I told you to go home.

185
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
What?

186
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I told you to go home.

187
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
It hurts.

188
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Why can't I hear you?

189
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I told you to go home.

190
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Everyone was eating.

191
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Please go home after you eat.

192
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I'm sorry.

193
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Yagami is a kind person.

194
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
He gave me a low score.

195
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Wait a minute.

196
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
How many points do you have?

197
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
What?

198
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
You were playing a game.

199
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I was playing a game.

200
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
For example,

201
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I'm going to come here.

202
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I'm going to order.

203
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Excuse me.

204
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
What would you like to order?

205
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I'd like an iced coffee.

206
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Okay.

207
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Excuse me.

208
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I'd like this.

209
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I'd like an iced coffee.

210
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I'd like an iced coffee.

211
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Don't start again.

212
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
You can go home.

213
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Father.

214
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Don't be shy.

215
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:36,000
It's a lie.

216
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
The game has started.

217
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
It's started.

218
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Yes.

219
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
What would you like to order?

220
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
She's a young woman.

221
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
That's right.

222
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Excuse me.

223
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
It's normal.

224
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
It's normal, right?

225
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
It's really normal.

226
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
You waited, right?

227
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I didn't wait.

228
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
You were having so much fun.

229
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Excuse me.

230
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Did you do something?

231
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Scary.

232
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
It's really scary.

233
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Ice coffee.

234
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I'll bring the menu.

235
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
No, I'll have the ice coffee.

236
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Excuse me.

237
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Please bring the menu.

238
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
It's normal.

239
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Excuse me.

240
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Excuse me.

241
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Excuse me.

242
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
We're not done yet, Mr. Matsumoto.

243
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Wait a minute.

244
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
We're not done yet?

245
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
That's right.

246
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
It can't be.

247
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
We're not done yet.

248
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Count properly.

249
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I'm counting.

250
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
We've been doing this for eight times.

251
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
We didn't say anything.

252
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Excuse me.

253
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
What is this?

254
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Excuse me.

255
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Where is the toilet?

256
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
But...

257
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I didn't think it would spin so much.

258
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
We're not done yet?

259
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
We're not done yet?

260
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Excuse me.

261
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
What is this?

262
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
The timing of the heat.

263
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
That's not the right timing.

264
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
That's the timing of the heat.

265
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I'll bring the menu.

266
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
That was terrible.

267
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
That was terrible.

268
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I was watching it all the time.

269
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
It's the same thing now.

270
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Can you do me a favor?

271
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I'd like a jam.

272
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Oh, jam.

273
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
That's right.

274
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
It's over there.

275
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Oh, I see.

276
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I'm sorry.

277
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I'm sorry.

278
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Again!

279
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
It's over there.

280
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
It's over there!

281
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
It's over there!

282
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
What did I just do?

283
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
It's over there.

284
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
It's over there.

285
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
It's over there.

286
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I'm sorry.

287
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I'm sorry.

288
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I'm sorry.

289
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I'm sorry, it's over there.

290
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I'm sorry, it's over there.

291
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
It's over there.

292
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I'm sorry.

293
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
That was great.

294
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
That was great.

295
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
That was great.

296
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
You said it 4 times.

297
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I've done that many times.

298
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
It was elegant.

299
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Let's do it again.

300
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Is it okay?

301
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Excuse me.

302
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Is that...

303
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Excuse me.

304
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Again!

305
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Again!

306
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Amazing.

307
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Excuse me.

308
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Again.

309
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Excuse me.

310
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Excuse me.

311
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Excuse me.

312
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Excuse me.

313
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Is it okay?

314
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
30 seconds left.

315
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Excuse me.

316
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Excuse me.

317
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
It's a dash.

318
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
The camera is already on.

319
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
The original.

320
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Excuse me.

321
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Excuse me.

322
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Look at that.

323
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Look at that.

324
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I can't get it.

325
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:35,000
8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1

326
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Please turn around

327
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Yes

328
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Sorry

329
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Turn around

330
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Yes

331
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I knew it

332
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
You're so excited

333
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
The result is

334
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Yes

335
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Team Hamada turned 3 times

336
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Yes

337
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Team Ninkyu turned 3 times

338
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Yes

339
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Team Endo and Matsumoto turned 3 times

340
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Yes

341
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Team Endo and Matsumoto turned 3 times

342
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Wait

343
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Listen

344
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Isn't it strange?

345
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
We've been waiting for the last one

346
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
We've been waiting for the last one

347
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I've been waiting for the last one

348
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Kageyama

349
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
That's all

350
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
What is this?

351
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
This is a game

352
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
It's a game

353
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
It's a fun game

354
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I don't need it anymore

355
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Why did you turn the wheel?

356
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I want to take you to Hamada

357
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Hamada, Tanaka, Shinji

358
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
It's strange

359
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
What's going on?

360
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
It's strange

361
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Let's turn the wheel

362
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Let's turn the wheel

363
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Let's see who turns the wheel

364
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Let's see who turns the wheel

365
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
The person who turns the wheel is Rei

366
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
You're the one who turns the wheel

367
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
The woman who turns the wheel is Rei

368
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Ladies and gentlemen

369
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
It's been a while

370
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Is it?

371
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Wait a minute

372
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
What's so strange about you guys?

373
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
You guys don't look like a funny duo

374
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
You guys don't look like a funny duo

375
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
You guys don't look like a funny duo

376
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
You guys don't look like a funny duo

377
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Did you go on a holiday?

378
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I did

379
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Did you really go to Ise?

380
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Yes, I went to Ise

381
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I went to Ise and Parque Espana

382
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I didn't go anymore

383
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
That's amazing

384
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
It's amazing

385
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
It's like this

386
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
It's amazing

387
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Fujiyama

388
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Fujiyama is not a fire

389
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Do you want to ride it?

390
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Who?

391
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
You

392
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Do you want to ride it by yourself?

393
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I can't hear you

394
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I can't ride it

395
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Is it a punishment game?

396
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Are you going to play a punishment game?

397
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
What punishment game?

398
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I can't ride it

399
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Why are you playing a punishment game?

400
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I said I can't ride it

401
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I can't ride it

402
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
That's amazing

403
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Why are you so scary?

404
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
It's you

405
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
No, it's not like that. In terms of character, I'm not scared of those things

406
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
It's just that Machan is cool

407
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
It's Machan

408
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Stop it

409
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
You don't need to be cool

410
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
It's just that he's cute

411
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
You're the type of person who goes all out in terms of character

412
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Why are you scared of those things?

413
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
You should go more

414
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Why?

415
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
You should ride it

416
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
If you're going to go to a place like that

417
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I want you to ride it

418
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Ise didn't really want to ride it

419
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Why?

420
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
It was really funny

421
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Kimura from the station was really funny

422
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
When I went to Ise, he was saying something

423
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Iwate, Ikea, something like that

424
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
He was saying that

425
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
He was eating udon at the drive-in

426
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
After that, he went back to the hotel and said cup ramen

427
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I don't know what he was doing

428
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
You guys don't know

429
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I ate something like a green fox

430
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I ate a green fox

431
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
But that year and that year

432
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
The taste of the green fox was a bit different

433
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Is that true?

434
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I know that

435
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
You should go eat something

436
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
You went all out

437
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
That's true

438
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
But if I go with everyone

439
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I'll have to pay for everything

440
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
You're such a troublemaker

441
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
That's not something I can do

442
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
What do you mean?

443
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Why do you have to pay for everything?

444
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
There are times like that

445
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
That's true

446
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
When you go out to eat with a woman

447
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
You wonder why a man has to pay for everything

448
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Women think it's normal

449
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I see

450
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I don't think that's right

451
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Women don't do that

452
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Women only pay when they have money

453
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
When they have money, they pay for everything

454
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
It's a sex pay

455
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
For me, even if a woman is walking

456
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
It's a sex pay

457
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Who are you paying for?

458
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I'm paying for men

459
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
The last time I saw a woman with her shoulders out

460
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
And her pants were like this

461
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Her pants were like this

462
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I didn't see her pants

463
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
That's why I want to sue her

464
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
That's fine

465
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
It's the second half

466
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
It's fine if you show it

467
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
You shouldn't be the only one paying

468
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Hagi

469
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Yes

470
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
After the rain has stopped

471
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
It's very annoying to walk around with a long umbrella

472
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Don't you have an easy and cool way to hold it?

473
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
You know

474
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
In the end

475
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Umm

476
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Please tell me

477
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I'm putting this together

478
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
A cool way to hold it

479
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
In the end

480
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Please tell me

481
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
When you think of an umbrella

482
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
This isn't an umbrella

483
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
This is an umbrella

484
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Is that okay?

485
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Yesterday was the first time I held an umbrella

486
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
An umbrella is an umbrella

487
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Strictly speaking

488
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
At this stage

489
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
It's in front of an umbrella

490
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
You can say that the umbrella is 20 years old

491
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
It's 20 years old

492
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
An umbrella is

493
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
This is called an umbrella

494
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
If it rains

495
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
You can do this

496
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
If it stops

497
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
You can do this

498
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Basically

499
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
An umbrella should be like this

500
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,000
This is the coolest way to hold it

501
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Don't tell me you're going to turn around from there

502
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
This is the coolest way to hold it

503
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
When someone calls you

504
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
This is the coolest way to hold it

505
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
What's cool?

506
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Why?

507
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I think this is the coolest way to hold it

508
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
No?

509
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Actually

510
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
If you hold an umbrella in the rain

511
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
When it's over

512
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Can you keep walking?

513
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Can I do this?

514
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
You can walk

515
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
There are people who get in my way

516
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
They come from this side

517
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I hit them

518
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Why are you surprised?

519
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I hit them

520
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I didn't think I would hit them

521
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I hit them

522
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
It'd be nice if you stretched it

523
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
It's nice if I stretched it

524
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:41,000
You can stretch it

525
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,340
It would be nice if you stretched it

526
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
It's nice if you stretch it

527
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
It's nice if you stretch it

528
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I've been hitting them for the past 15 years

529
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Did you have a fight?

530
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
You should have stretched it!

531
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
You should have closed it!

532
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
You should have stretched it!

533
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
You should have closed it!

534
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,000
You should have stretched it!

535
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
You should have stretched it!

536
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
When you park your bicycle in the middle of the road,

537
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
there are times when you find trash in the basket.

538
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Yes, there are.

539
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
It's annoying to throw it away.

540
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
It's annoying.

541
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
But you can also throw it away.

542
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
What do you do to make it look the best?

543
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
It can make you look beautiful.

544
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
There are many ways to do it.

545
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
The first way is to ignore it.

546
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Ignore it?

547
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
When I'm riding my bicycle,

548
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
there's trash in front of it.

549
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
You can also pretend to be on the bike

550
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
and hide in the middle of the road.

551
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
No one is watching.

552
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
You can go home riding your bicycle

553
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
and say,

554
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Yo-san, I did this today.

555
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Or this.

556
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
No!

557
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
There are many ways to do it.

558
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
There are many ways to do it.

559
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
But I brought it home.

560
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
But that's impossible.

561
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
You can't do anything about it.

562
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
That's true.

563
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
What should I do with the trash?

564
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Are you ready?

565
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
You treated your bicycle as a trash can.

566
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
That's right.

567
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
That's a terrible thing to say.

568
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
That's true.

569
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
It's my bicycle.

570
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
There's a lot of trash in it.

571
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
That's right.

572
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
I'm telling the truth.

573
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
What should I do?

574
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Yay.

575
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
It's yay.

576
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Yay.

577
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Did you grow up?

578
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I don't care about that.

579
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Why?

580
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
What are you going to do with the trash?

581
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
The trash in the basket...

582
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Don't say that.

583
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
What are you talking about?

584
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
I'm sorry.

585
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
What are you going to do with the trash in the basket?

586
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
What are you going to do?

587
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
What?

588
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
What are you going to do with the trash in the basket?

589
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Don't talk in Osaka dialect.

590
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
What should I do with the trash in the basket?

591
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I don't know.

592
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Let's do it.

593
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
It's a shame.

594
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Hey, Matsumoto.

595
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I knew it.

596
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Who said that?

597
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
You made me think.

598
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Please.

599
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
You made me think.

600
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
You made me think.

601
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
You made me think.

602
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
You made me think.

603
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
What should I do with the trash?

604
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
It's trash.

605
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
It's trash.

606
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Who said that?

607
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Who?

608
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
You made me think.

609
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
You made me think.

610
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
There is no trash in my bicycle.

611
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
That's right.

612
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
There is no trash in my bicycle.

613
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
That's right.

614
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
I wonder if I can finish it.

615
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Something amazing happened in my house.

616
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
My grandmother often takes a nap.

617
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
My grandmother often takes a nap.

618
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
My grandmother often takes a nap.

619
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
I don't know if she is a fool.

620
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
I don't know if she is a fool.

621
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
But she breaks the calendar.

622
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
It's New Year's Day in my house.

623
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
It's New Year's Day in my house.

624
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
I'm happy and I'm silly.

625
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
I'm happy and I'm silly.

626
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Goodbye.

627
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
I was wondering why I had my hair in the basket.

628
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
I was wondering why I had my hair in the basket.

629
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I'm in trouble.

630
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I'm in trouble.

631
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
What am I supposed to do with that?

632
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,000
It's strange. I'm waiting for the magazine to be published.

633
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Downtown's key user Arahen.

634
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Well, he's a key user, but he denied it in the second half.

635
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Ah, key user Arahen.

636
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:24,000
I want you to take a look at it.

637
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Give me the monitor.

638
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Stop it.

639
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Ah, there's a monitor.

640
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Turn off the light.

641
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
What?

642
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
It's downtown.

643
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
No way.

644
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
What are you talking about?

645
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
It's downtown.

646
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Really?

647
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Did I read downtown?

648
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
No way.

649
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Let's take a look at it.
