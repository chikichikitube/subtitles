1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Good evening.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Good evening.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Good evening.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I came to Asakusa today.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
That's great.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
When customers come to the ticket office, the discount is 1,100 yen.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
That's right.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
When I say that the discount is 1,100 yen,

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
it's usually 1,800 yen.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm surprised.

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Look.

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
When a great person comes out,

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Candy Boys is our master.

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Candy Boys is our master.

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I didn't know there was a place like this.

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
This person was a tough guy.

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
It was tough.

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I got to know this person.

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I got to know this person.

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
My head was hit.

21
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
The name of the person I met was Bontaname.

22
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Is that so?

23
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Is Juna North Carolina?

24
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
That's right.

25
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
He said it had to be the rain of today.

26
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
This is Asakusa, France.

27
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
It's famous.

28
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Mr. Takeshi and Kin-chan.

29
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
What do you call them?

30
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
It was a time when they were training.

31
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Miss Baby.

32
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
What kind of person is that?

33
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Miss Natasha.

34
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
She's Japanese.

35
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Today, we're going to a great place.

36
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Here comes a tough guy.

37
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Let's talk to this tough guy.

38
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Good evening.

39
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Good evening.

40
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Dad, where are you going?

41
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm going to a bar.

42
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
A bar?

43
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm going to a bar.

44
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Dad, we're local people.

45
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
What are you talking about?

46
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm going to Osaka.

47
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm not going to Osaka.

48
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I'm going to Osaka.

49
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
It's fun.

50
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I don't think there's a place like this in Osaka.

51
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I don't think there's a place like this in Osaka.

52
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Dad.

53
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm scared.

54
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I'm scared.

55
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I don't have a ride.

56
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I don't have a ride.

57
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
It's here.

58
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
It's here.

59
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
It's here.

60
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
We're going to do it here today.

61
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
We're going to do it here today.

62
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
We're going to do it here today.

63
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Let's do our best.

64
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Let's do our best.

65
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Let's do our best.

66
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Ladies and gentlemen.

67
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Hey, you know.

68
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Hey, you know.

69
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I'm not going to say anything, so I won't say anything about my costume.

70
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I'm not going to say anything, so I won't say anything about my costume.

71
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I won't say anything about my costume.

72
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
You're right.

73
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
You're right.

74
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Today is the second time.

75
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
However, we are doing a manzai in an amazing place.

76
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
It's amazing.

77
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
There is no manzai like this in Osaka.

78
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
This is the second time today.

79
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Last time, it was a little more youthful.

80
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
But today...

81
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
What is this sound?

82
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
There are about four people here.

83
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
This is like an amazing theater.

84
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Sada Ryuji didn't come out.

85
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
That's right.

86
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
This is the second time today.

87
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I don't think we've ever seen a manzai.

88
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I think so.

89
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Recently, I've been going to Tokyo.

90
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I'm glad I went to downtown.

91
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
The name is...

92
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I don't think downtown is cool.

93
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I'm glad I went to downtown.

94
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
The name was different from downtown.

95
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
That's right.

96
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I don't have a master.

97
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I was given a name by the boss of my company, Yoshimoto.

98
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I met a boss.

99
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
When I made my debut, I was more popular.

100
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
It was dark.

101
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I was doing a dark manzai.

102
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I was called by the boss.

103
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I was given a name.

104
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I've been calling my name for a long time.

105
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I'm Teruo Haruo.

106
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
That's right.

107
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I'm Teruo and Haruo.

108
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
The atmosphere of today's stage is Teruo Haruo.

109
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
That's right.

110
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
That's right.

111
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
That's right.

112
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I don't have a costume.

113
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
That's right.

114
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
You're particular about it.

115
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I don't have a costume.

116
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
That's right.

117
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
There's a lot of talk about it these days.

118
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
There's a lot of talk about it these days.

119
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
There's a lot of talk about it these days.

120
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
It's been like that since before.

121
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
That's right.

122
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I've been on this song 24 hours a day.

123
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I've been saying, I'll save the earth.

124
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I've been saying, I'll save the African refugees.

125
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I think it's better if everyone thought about how to do it.

126
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
That's the best.

127
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
What are you talking about?

128
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Even if there's a woman in there,

129
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
If you're in there,

130
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Put a dollar or five dollars in the bottle.

131
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
There may be people who take it.

132
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I don't have anything to eat.

133
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I don't have anything to wear.

134
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
You're giving me something to eat!

135
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I have to get her for you in the first place.

136
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
There's no food.

137
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Give him food.

138
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
They should be having more than that.

139
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Kuroyanagi Tetsuko is wearing a life jacket.

140
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
It won't be.

141
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Oh, really.

142
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
It's closer than a life jacket to a teenage richest man.

143
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Take a look at my aioli, I'm going to have it.

144
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
You see it and it's annoying, isn't it?

145
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I didn't even know my facial expression.

146
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Maybe with the dead lash....

147
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
You're lying!

148
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
You're not going to clean it up, are you?

149
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
It's really annoying.

150
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
But it can't be helped.

151
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
They don't have anything to eat, so it's a pity.

152
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
They're all hungry, aren't they?

153
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I can see their bones.

154
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
They're not going to use it, are they?

155
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
They're all being fooled.

156
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
They don't have anything to eat, they don't have strength, they don't have strength.

157
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
If you look at them, there are a lot of babies.

158
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
They have a lot of strength, don't they?

159
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
They're doing what they have to do, aren't they?

160
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
That's a different kind of energy.

161
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
No matter how tired you are, you do what you have to do, don't you?

162
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Well, that's true.

163
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
What are you going to do if you admit it?

164
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
That's their brain reaction.

165
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
What's that?

166
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
What's that brain reaction to those people in America?

167
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
When I look at the camera, even though I'm giving it to everyone,

168
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
it's like this.

169
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
That's...

170
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
It's hard.

171
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
You've seen their physical strength, haven't you?

172
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Even so, when I give it to everyone,

173
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
even when I look at the camera,

174
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
it's like this.

175
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I'm not going to do anything.

176
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
You're not going to do anything because you don't have that energy?

177
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I'm not going to do anything because I don't have that energy.

178
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I don't care about that.

179
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
You don't care about that at night, do you?

180
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I'm not going to be fooled by them.

181
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
What?

182
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
They say that you're a rich man in Japan, right?

183
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
That's right.

184
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Compared to Shura, I think Japan is a little too rich.

185
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
That's true.

186
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Even if you watch the TV program, you have to pay a lot of money.

187
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
That's right.

188
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
That's a quiz show.

189
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
You have to pay a lot of money.

190
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
That's right.

191
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I'm going to give you a quiz today.

192
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
That's not it.

193
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
You did that last week, didn't you?

194
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
What?

195
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Last week, you said you were going to give me a quiz.

196
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
It's the second time.

197
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
You can't do that.

198
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
It's been a week since then.

199
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
You're famous in the comedy world

200
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
for not doing the same thing.

201
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Where is it?

202
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Where is it?

203
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Is it in the quiz?

204
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
It's in the quiz.

205
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I've been big since then.

206
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
It's different from that quiz.

207
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
It's a different quiz?

208
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Are you okay?

209
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Do you want to do it?

210
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I don't know what it is.

211
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I know what it is.

212
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I don't know what it is.

213
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I don't know what it is.

214
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
That's not it.

215
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
That's not it.

216
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
That's not it.

217
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
What's that?

218
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
It's the one on the left.

219
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Good luck!

220
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Is that what it means?

221
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Where do you work?

222
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I work at a unclean restaurant.

223
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I like what I hear.

224
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I got a little bored.

225
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Do your best.

226
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Do your best.

227
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Do you want to go there?

228
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
That's what it means.

229
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
What was it?

230
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Do you want to go there?

231
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
What are you talking about?

232
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
What is it?

233
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Do you want to go to America?

234
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Do you want to go there?

235
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Where is there?

236
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,000
This country is where everyone wants to go.

237
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
That's why it's usually decided on the show.

238
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
This time it's America, this time it's Switzerland, right?

239
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
If it's Switzerland, do you want to go to Switzerland?

240
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Do you want to go there?

241
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Where is it?

242
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Today's corner is that corner.

243
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Do your best, Mr. Miyahana.

244
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Do you want to go there?

245
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
If you want to go, you have to get it right.

246
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
That corner looks good.

247
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
If you get it right, how about that corner?

248
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I'll definitely get it right.

249
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Now, the first question.

250
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Today's first question is very easy.

251
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Eat upside-down words!

252
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Eat upside-down words.

253
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
If you answer with upside-down words, it will be the answer.

254
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
It's very easy.

255
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
It's as it is.

256
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
It's easy, right?

257
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Let's practice.

258
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
For example, the height of this upside-down.

259
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Low.

260
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Low.

261
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
That's right.

262
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Far.

263
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Close.

264
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Close.

265
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
This is Hamada-san's problem.

266
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
What is it?

267
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
It's coming from the first shot, Mr. Hamada.

268
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
That's amazing, Mr. Hamada.

269
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
It's the same if you get it right.

270
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Thank you.

271
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Now, the first question of the upside-down quiz.

272
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Let's go to the question.

273
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Yes.

274
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Ta-da!

275
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Tanihayato.

276
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Wait.

277
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Wait.

278
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
What are you doing?

279
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
What is it?

280
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
The word upside-down.

281
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
It's high.

282
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
It's low.

283
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
It's close.

284
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
It's far.

285
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
What is Tanihayato?

286
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Tell me the word upside-down of Tanihayato.

287
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Tell me the word upside-down of Tanihayato.

288
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Tanihayato.

289
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Marine blue quiz.

290
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Shut up!

291
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Wait.

292
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
What is it?

293
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Marine blue quiz.

294
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Marine blue quiz.

295
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Listen to me.

296
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
What is the word upside-down of Tanihayato?

297
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Marine blue is fine.

298
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
What is the word upside-down of Tanihayato?

299
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I want to hear the answer.

300
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Please ask the question.

301
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Answer me.

302
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
What is the word upside-down of Tanihayato?

303
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Marine blue quiz.

304
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
You know it, don't you?

305
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I asked the question to 100 people.

306
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Just say it.

307
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
What is the word upside-down of Tanihayato?

308
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I asked the question to 100 people.

309
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
That's right.

310
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
What is Marine blue?

311
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Marine blue quiz is...

312
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Please do your best, Hamada-san.

313
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Hamada-san is...

314
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
You know that I asked the question to 100 people.

315
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Yes, I know.

316
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Our staff asked the question to 100 people.

317
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
The answer is the most.

318
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
That's the answer.

319
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
You said it before.

320
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I want you to do your best.

321
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I'll do my best.

322
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I'll do my best.

323
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Today's question is...

324
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
In Shibuya,

325
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
100 people are listening to Oakman.

326
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Why?

327
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I'm playing the music.

328
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Can you hear me?

329
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
What should I do?

330
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Hamada-san, you have to listen to the question.

331
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I asked the question to 100 people.

332
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
100 people?

333
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
You didn't answer me.

334
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
So I asked the question again.

335
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
But you didn't answer me.

336
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I want you to listen to the question.

337
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I'll do my best.

338
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Do you want to go there?

339
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Yes, I want to go there.

340
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
You can say it.

341
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
It's like they're welcoming you.

342
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I'll go.

343
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I asked the question to 100 people.

344
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I asked you to remove the Oakman.

345
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I'll ask you one more question.

346
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I asked the question to 100 people after I removed the Oakman.

347
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I asked the question to 100 people after I removed the Oakman.

348
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:11,000
How are you doing recently?

349
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Are you kidding me?

350
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Hamada-san.

351
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Hamada-san, what kind of answer is that?

352
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Hamada-san.

353
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
How are you doing recently?

354
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Dad, don't touch me.

355
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Hamada-san.

356
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,000
How are you doing recently?

357
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
How are you doing recently?

358
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
How are you doing recently?

359
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Dad, don't touch me.

360
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Hamada-san.

361
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
You speak clearly.

362
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Dad, don't touch me.

363
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
How are you doing recently?

364
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Answer me.

365
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
How are you doing recently?

366
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I asked the question to 100 people.

367
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Blue Sky Quiz.

368
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000

00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Your quiz has changed a lot.

372
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Thank you very much.

373
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Hamada-san, do you know Santa's Quiz?

374
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Yes.

375
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
You know it, right?

376
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
The answer is one out of three.

377
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:16,000
This Blue Sky Quiz is 20 questions.

378
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Do your best.

379
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
It's even more difficult.

380
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
It's even more difficult.

381
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
This quiz is very easy.

382
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Don't say that.

383
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Let me tell you the question first.

384
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
What is it?

385
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Today's question is very easy.

386
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I think you will be angry if I make fun of you.

387
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:40,000
The question is, what is the name of the current Prime Minister of Japan?

388
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Is that OK?

389
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
The name of that person is already on your mind, right?

390
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
It's already on your mind, right?

391
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
It's obvious that you got it.

392
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Wait a minute.

393
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
The staff thought of 20 questions.

394
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
You have to answer them.

395
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
When the time comes, you have to answer.

396
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Don't be impatient.

397
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I know that.

398
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I know that.

399
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Maybe it's a river, right?

400
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
It's OK.

401
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Hamada-san, do your best.

402
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
It's 20 questions.

403
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
When the time comes, you have to answer.

404
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I got it.

405
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Yamashita.

406
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Kato.

407
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Kubo.

408
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Hagino.

409
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Nishio.

410
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
John.

411
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
It's definitely wrong.

412
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Takeda.

413
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Kaifu.

414
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Hamada-san, you have to answer.

415
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
It's already on your mind, right?

416
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Yes.

417
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Please answer.

418
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Kaifu.

419
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Hamada-san, please answer with a number.

420
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Say it earlier.

421
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Say it earlier.

422
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I got it.

423
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Say it earlier.

424
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Kaifu.

425
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
How many times have I forgotten?

426
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
If you don't remember this, you can't answer Blue Sky Quiz.

427
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
You have to answer with a number.

428
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,000
You have to answer with a number.

429
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Do you understand?

430
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:16,000
What the hell is this?

431
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
This is the last quiz of today.

432
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Please do your best.

433
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
You don't understand.

434
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Please do your best.

435
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I'll do my best.

436
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Today's quiz is very easy.

437
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
It's the last quiz, so it's very easy.

438
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Please do your best.

439
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I don't understand.

440
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Hamada-san, be motivated.

441
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Dad, be motivated.

442
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I'll do my best.

443
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Please do your best.

444
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Today's quiz is very easy.

445
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Here is the question.

446
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:54,000
What is the weather in Tokyo on October 10th?

447
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
You answer.

448
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,000
You have been asking questions, but you can't answer.

449
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
You have to answer.

450
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
You have to answer.

451
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Hamada-san, I'll give you a special time today.

452
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
You can go outside to see the weather.

453
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
There is no such problem.

454
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I'm grateful for that time.

455
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
The person in front of the TV is making fun of you.

456
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Why don't you understand this?

457
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Today, you are a loser.

458
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
You are a loser.

459
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I don't understand.

460
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I understand.

461
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
The answer is rain.

462
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
The answer is sunny.

463
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
The answer is cloudy.

464
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I'll leave the rest to the editor.

465
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I came to Asakusa for the first time in my life.

466
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
How is it?

467
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I'm going to get used to Tokyo.

468
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:11,000
But I can't accept Osaka people.

469
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Really?

470
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I don't like it.

471
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
You are listening to the story with a loving eye.

472
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I'm not a man, but I'm usually cold.

473
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Are you cold?

474
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I'm cold.

475
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I don't like the way girls talk.

476
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Why?

477
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
What?

478
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Girls are better than Osaka people.

479
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Tokyo girls repeat what people say.

480
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I'm tired and my head hurts.

481
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
You are tired and your head hurts.

482
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I'm saying it.

483
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I'm not saying it.

484
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I'm tired and my head hurts.

485
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I'm saying it again.

486
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Why are you saying it?

487
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I'm tired and my head hurts.

488
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I have a nose.

489
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I'm tired and my head hurts.

490
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I have a nose.

491
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
You have a good sense.

492
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I think Tokyo is good.

493
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Taxi drivers are good.

494
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Really?

495
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Yes.

496
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
They are kind.

497
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
They listen to me.

498
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,000
For example, if I ask them to go to Fuji TV, they listen to me.

499
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I can't ask them that in Osaka.

500
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
But I don't like one thing.

501
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:24,000
For example, if I ask them to go in the opposite direction, they go in the opposite direction.

502
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
In Osaka, they go around.

503
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,000
If I ask them where they want to go, they say it's the opposite direction.

504
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
It's the opposite direction.

505
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
It would be great if you were there.

506
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I think taxi drivers in Tokyo are good.

507
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
They listen to me.

508
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I don't know where to go.

509
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I don't know.

510
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
They are kind.

511
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I don't know where to go.

512
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I don't know where to go.

513
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I don't know where to go.

514
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
The people I rode with the other day were really kind.

515
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
How do you feel about the taxi?

516
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
What?

517
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
How do you feel about the taxi?

518
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Everyone is saying that.

519
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I'm surprised.

520
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
It's cute.

521
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Really.

522
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
In that sense...

523
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Is there anything good about Tokyo?

524
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Something good about Tokyo?

525
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
But it's still a new place, so what's good about it?

526
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:24,000
For example, if it's famous, they say the food is different.

527
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I think girls in Tokyo are good.

528
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Really?

529
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Yes.

530
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
The girls in Tokyo have thin legs.

531
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Don't look down.

532
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Osaka girls have thick legs.

533
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
You have thick legs.

534
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Your legs are about 8 meters long.

535
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
It doesn't fit.

536
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Really?

537
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
That's strange.

538
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Did you kick a club in your past life?

539
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Don't say that.

540
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
It's a joke.

541
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
It's a joke.

542
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
It's a joke.

543
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I heard you had a cold today.

544
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Yes.

545
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I got a shot because I was tired.

546
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Do you really have a cold?

547
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:26,000
You're trying to get attention from everyone, aren't you?

548
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
You lie and say you have a cold.

549
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Are you a transfer student?

550
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
I'm trying to get attention.

551
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
You're trying to get everyone's attention.

552
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:42,000
When I came to Tokyo, I didn't make the same mistake as I did in Osaka.

553
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:49,000
I tried to make a cute character.

554
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Osaka fans are controlled by Hamada.

555
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
I'll make the same mistake again in Tokyo.

556
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
It's been a long time since I got a shot.

557
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
I went to the hospital in Nittere.

558
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I can't get a shot very often.

559
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,000
The doctor told me to get a shot.

560
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
It's in the Nittere station.

561
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
You can't get a shot like this.

562
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
You can't get a shot like this.

563
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I asked him if I was going to get a shot.

564
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
He said I was going to get a shot.

565
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
I got a shot in the end.

566
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
But there was a lot of air left.

567
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I didn't get a shot yet.

568
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,000
The nurse hit me with a needle.

569
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
I thought it was strange.

570
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
What if I got a shot?

571
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,000
We don't have a chance to do a manzai in Tokyo.

572
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:46,000
I'll do as much as I can tonight.

573
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
It's a little late.

574
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,000
It's 1 o'clock and 40 minutes.

575
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
I want you to do your best.

576
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Thank you very much for your time today.

577
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:01,000
See you next time.

578
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
I had a lot of fun.

579
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
How many times are you going to do this?

580
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
It's a manzai.

581
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,000
I was born with a manzai.

582
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,000
How many times are you going to do it?

583
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
I'm asking you the number of times.

584
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
How many times are you going to do a manzai?

585
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,000
I've done it 18 times so far.

586
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Really?

587
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,000
I'll show you the completed video.

588
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:37,000
At 7 or 8 p.m. on Saturday, I'll show you the golden manzai.

589
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
I'll pay for it.

590
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
I don't pay for this program at all.

591
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:49,000
I want to hear the opinions of the people who watch TV.

592
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I don't want to do a manzai.

593
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,000
I don't want to do a manzai.

594
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
I don't want to do a manzai.

595
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
I'm waiting for your opinions.

596
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
We're preparing for it right now.

597
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Are you ready?

598
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Yes, we are.

599
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,000
I want to hear the opinions of the viewers.

600
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
I want to hear the opinions of comedians.

601
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
I'm curious about what the people who work in the field think.

602
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
I don't know.

603
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,000
I'll buy the program.

604
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
I'll pay for it.

605
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Well, let's do it.

606
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Let's do it at a later time.

607
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
It's a drama.

608
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
It's about time for us to say goodbye.

609
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Yes.

610
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
It's so hot in here.

611
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
It was a little difficult.

612
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
See you next week.

613
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
See you next week.

614
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Goodbye.

615
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
This program was brought to you by Toyosui-san,

616
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000

617
