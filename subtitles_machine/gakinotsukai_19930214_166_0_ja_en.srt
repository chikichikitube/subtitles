1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Old man, old woman, are you watching?

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
In the first episode of Gaki no Tsukai, we will be investigating Dan-san!

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
As you can see today, we will be investigating Dan-san.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Oh, is that so?

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Yes.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
How far will he go?

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
How far will he go?

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
How far will he go?

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
How far will he go?

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
How far will he go?

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
How far will he go?

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
How far will he go?

13
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
As you can see, right before we went to the toilet,

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
two girls were in the women's toilet.

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
They were saying, if you don't hurry up, it will start.

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
There were two people who were exercising.

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
First of all, the old man and the old woman.

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Oh.

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
The old man and the old woman.

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I will show you this photo.

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Which one of you do you like?

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
They are asking like this.

23
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
You can't see it.

24
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
This is downtown.

25
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Here we go.

26
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Downtown, Kinya Kitaoji, Koutaro Satomi, Ryo Tsugi, Hideki Takahashi, Ken Matsudaira.

27
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
You don't have the confidence to win this.

28
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
How do you win?

29
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
They are asking the old man and the old woman.

30
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Among the old man and the old woman, which one do you like?

31
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
That's right.

32
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
First, let's see it.

33
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Of course, it's Kitaoji.

34
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Koutaro Satomi.

35
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
He is very handsome.

36
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I don't like him.

37
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Koutaro Satomi.

38
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I don't like him.

39
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Hideki Takahashi.

40
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Ryo Tsugi.

41
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Ken Matsudaira.

42
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
He is handsome.

43
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Koutaro Satomi.

44
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Koutaro Satomi.

45
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Kitaoji.

46
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Hideki Takahashi.

47
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Hideki Takahashi.

48
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Ryo Tsugi.

49
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Kitaoji.

50
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I don't like him.

51
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Hideki Takahashi.

52
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Hideki Takahashi.

53
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
He is very manly.

54
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Koutaro Satomi.

55
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I don't like him.

56
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
It is not entered in the first vote.

57
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
The middle of the old man and the old woman are Hideki Takahashi.

58
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,020
Koutaro Satomi.

59
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:30,020
Koutaro Satomi.

60
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:31,020
Kitaoji.

61
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:32,020
Ryo Tsugi.

62
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:33,020
Koutaro Satomi.

63
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:34,020
Koutaro Satomi.

64
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,020
Koutaro Satomi.

65
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:36,020
Koutaro Satomi.

66
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:37,020
Ryo Tsugi.

67
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,020
Koutaro Satomi.

68
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:39,020
Koutaro Satomi.

69
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:41,020
For us, Reihou is Reihou.

70
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:42,020
Reihou is Reihou.

71
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:44,020
Reihou. That's why I'm saying it to Kouji Satomi.

72
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:47,020
That's right. Even if all of them die, it's still Reihou.

73
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:49,020
There's nothing I can do about it.

74
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:52,020
I see.

75
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:54,020
It's completely different from Kii-chan's version.

76
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:55,020
Completely different.

77
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:56,020
Completely different.

78
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:57,020
It's like I'm not interested at all.

79
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:58,020
Completely different.

80
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:00,020
Now, let's move on.

81
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:02,020
The next one is the high school girls' edition.

82
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:04,020
This is what it looks like.

83
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:10,020
Downtown, Eguchi Yosuke, Fukuyama... What is it? I don't know.

84
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:17,020
I don't know, but Fukuyama is very popular these days.

85
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:18,020
That's right.

86
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:22,020
As a man, I'm definitely higher.

87
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:29,020
Mook.

88
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:31,020
Fukuyama Masaharu.

89
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:32,020
Eguchi Yosuke.

90
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:34,020
A wild place.

91
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:35,020
Downtown.

92
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:36,020
Mook.

93
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:37,020
Hosaka Naoki.

94
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:39,020
Fukuyama Masaharu.

95
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:40,020
Motoki.

96
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,020
A sexy place.

97
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:42,020
Fukuyama Masaharu.

98
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:43,020
Downtown.

99
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:45,020
Eguchi Yosuke.

100
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:46,020
Fukuyama Masaharu.

101
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:47,020
Downtown.

102
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:48,020
I like it because it's romantic.

103
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:49,020
Fukuyama Masaharu.

104
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,020
Eguchi Yosuke.

105
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:51,020
Mook.

106
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:52,020
Fukuyama.

107
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:53,020
A cold place.

108
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:54,020
Downtown.

109
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:55,020
Downtown.

110
00:03:55,020 --> 00:04:02,020
Mook.

111
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:03,020
Eguchi Yosuke.

112
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:04,020
Fukuyama.

113
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:05,020
Oh.

114
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:07,020
It's a public place.

115
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:11,020
I don't care if you do this with me.

116
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:13,020
I don't know at all.

117
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:15,020
This, this.

118
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:17,020
Where did you come from?

119
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:19,020
I don't know at all.

120
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:20,020
Tell me.

121
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:21,020
Why?

122
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:23,020
Why did you come out?

123
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:25,020
Drama?

124
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:27,020
Did you come out in a drama?

125
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:28,020
There was.

126
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:31,020
What the hell are you doing?

127
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:34,020
Hey.

128
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:36,020
You're crazy.

129
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:41,020
Next, the foreigner edition.

130
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:44,020
I was very popular with foreigners the other day.

131
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:45,020
What is it?

132
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:47,020
I was popular with the scary guys.

133
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:52,020
A little more.

134
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:54,020
I'm listening to the foreigners.

135
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:55,020
Yes.

136
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:57,020
Well, of course, Akebono.

137
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:58,020
Shiwachan.

138
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:59,020
Sankon.

139
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:00,020
Kevin Costner.

140
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:01,020
Michael Jackson.

141
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:03,020
Oh, here.

142
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:05,020
Michael Jackson or.

143
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:07,020
Isn't it Kevin Costner now?

144
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:08,020
Is that so?

145
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:09,020
Yes.

146
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:11,020
I think I'm better than Akebono.

147
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:12,020
No.

148
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,020
I don't know.

149
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:15,020
This is.

150
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:17,020
I'm better than this.

151
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:21,020
If it was Akebono, I'd be better alone.

152
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:26,020
No, no.

153
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:27,020
No, no.

154
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:29,020
It's not about Timo.

155
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:34,020
How do you say this?

156
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:42,020
I think it's about the heat.

157
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:43,020
Arnold Schwarzenegger.

158
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:44,020
No. 1.

159
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:45,020
Kevin Costner.

160
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:46,020
Arnold Schwarzenegger.

161
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:47,020
It's Kebron.

162
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:48,020
Kevin Costner.

163
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:49,020
Akebono.

164
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:50,020
Akebono

165
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:53,020
He symbolizes the American spirit in Japan.

166
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,020
I like Arnold.

167
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,020
Schwarzenegger, yes, in downtown.

168
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:58,020
Osman Sanko.

169
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:00,020
He has my first, my same name.

170
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:01,020
Akebono

171
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:03,020
Kevin Costner

172
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:05,020
I think Kevin Costner is my favorite.

173
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:07,020
He seems to be really like a family man.

174
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:09,020
Downtown

175
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:11,020
Akebono

176
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:13,020
Akebono

177
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:15,020
Akebono

178
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:20,020
Akebono

179
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:23,020
He is the best.

180
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:26,020
He is not Akebono.

181
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:27,020
Akebono

182
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:29,020
He is the best.

183
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:31,020
He is good in time.

184
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:33,020
He is not good at the game. He is losing to Sanko.

185
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:35,020
That's true.

186
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,020
That's true.

187
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,020
He is getting more and more interesting.

188
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:40,020
Do you understand?

189
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:43,020
Interesting.

190
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:44,020
Let's go to the last one.

191
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:47,020
The last one is Okamahen.

192
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:50,020
Okamahen in Roppongi.

193
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:52,020
Let's go to this one.

194
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:54,020
This picture.

195
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:55,020
Downtown

196
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,020
Ucchananchan

197
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,020
Katochankinchan

198
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:58,020
Tunnel

199
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:59,020
Honjabaka

200
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:01,020
Yasushi Kiyoshi

201
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:10,020
I don't want to be number one here.

202
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:12,020
Downtown

203
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:14,020
Tunnel

204
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:15,020
Ucchananchan

205
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:16,020
Katochankinchan

206
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:18,020
Ucchananchan

207
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,020
Tunnel

208
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:21,020
He is a good man.

209
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:22,020
Yasushi Kiyoshi

210
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:23,020
Downtown

211
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:25,020
Downtown

212
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:27,020
He is a naughty boy.

213
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:28,020
Honjabaka

214
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:29,020
Tunnel

215
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:31,020
Ucchananchan

216
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:32,020
I think he is very cute.

217
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:34,020
Ucchananchan

218
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,020
Downtown

219
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:37,020
Katochankinchan

220
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:38,020
Katochankinchan

221
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:39,020
Yasushi Kiyoshi

222
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:40,020
Downtown

223
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:42,020
Yay! Yay! Yay!

224
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:44,020
Downtown

225
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:46,020
Downtown

226
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:55,020
I don't want to be number one here.

227
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:56,020
Yasushi Kiyoshi

228
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:57,020
Honjabaka

229
00:07:57,020 --> 00:08:01,020
I think I am number one here.

230
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:03,020
I think so too.

231
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:05,020
I am not saying which one is better.

232
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:08,020
I am saying downtown.

233
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:11,020
That means you are number one here.

234
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:14,020
What do you mean?

235
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:16,020
What is your strategy?

236
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:19,020
I don't want to be number one.

237
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:21,020
What about your children and your grandparents?

238
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:23,020
I don't want to be number one.

239
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:28,020
I am in charge of the girls and the parents.

240
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:34,020
I am in charge of the younger generation.

241
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:39,020
Ladies and gentlemen.

242
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:40,020
Hello.

243
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,020
Hello.

244
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,020
Hello.

245
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:43,020
It's been a while.

246
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:47,020
I've been up early these days.

247
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:48,020
That's not a good thing.

248
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:49,020
I've been up early.

249
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:50,020
I see.

250
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:53,020
When I woke up at 12 or 1 in the morning, I was really sleepy.

251
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:55,020
I was really sleepy.

252
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:56,020
Your body temperature was changing.

253
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:57,020
My body temperature was changing.

254
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:59,020
My body temperature was changing.

255
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:03,020
I would wake up at 10 in the morning.

256
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:04,020
In the morning?

257
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,020
Yes.

258
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:08,020
I would go to the convenience store downstairs and eat by myself.

259
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:09,020
At school?

260
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:10,020
Yes.

261
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:13,020
I would eat while looking at the wide screen.

262
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:15,020
You were a housewife.

263
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:17,020
Yes, I was a housewife.

264
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:22,020
I would go to the convenience store and watch TV.

265
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:23,020
You were lying.

266
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:26,020
Did you go there everyday?

267
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:30,020
Why do you weigh yourself?

268
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:31,020
Well...

269
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:35,020
Didn't you get sleepy at midnight?

270
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:38,020
Yes, I would be very sleepy.

271
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:41,020
So you would wait to go home and work.

272
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:42,020
Yes.

273
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:44,020
At 12 in the morning, you would go to bed.

274
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:45,020
I would go to bed immediately.

275
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:46,020
Did you go to sleep?

276
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:53,020
In the past, when I was sleeping, I didn't sleep until the morning, and I couldn't wake up until the evening.

277
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:57,020
Even if I woke up, I couldn't wake up when Okamoto was still in bed.

278
00:09:57,020 --> 00:10:00,020
I don't understand that, but you couldn't wake up.

279
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:03,020
In the past, I couldn't wake up. Now, I can't wake up. I'm an old man.

280
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:06,020
When it's midnight, I go to sleep.

281
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:09,020
And when it's midnight, I wake up.

282
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:11,020
What are you doing?

283
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:14,020
What are you talking about?

284
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:17,020
Why are you looking at me like that?

285
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:19,020
Hey!

286
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:21,020
The king's ears...

287
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:27,020
The news is also strong now.

288
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:29,020
I know it relatively well.

289
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:31,020
What is it?

290
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:33,020
The one with the arrow.

291
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:34,020
Yes, yes, yes.

292
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:35,020
The crow, the crow, the crow.

293
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:37,020
You've been doing something all the time, haven't you?

294
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:39,020
That, that, that.

295
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:42,020
Everyone's been talking about the crow with the arrow.

296
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:45,020
The crow with the arrow.

297
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:47,020
It's hard to say.

298
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:49,020
I can't decide on a name.

299
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:51,020
I've been saying Yagamo recently.

300
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:53,020
Yagamo.

301
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:55,020
Yagamo.

302
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:56,020
It's abbreviated.

303
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:59,020
I want you to stop using that name.

304
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:01,020
I've been saying Yagamo.

305
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:05,020
Why is everyone talking about it so much?

306
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:07,020
It's on sale.

307
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:09,020
If you're going to pay attention to that kind of thing,

308
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:12,020
I'll put something on your shoulder.

309
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:15,020
I want you to pay attention to it, so I'll put something like this on your shoulder.

310
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:18,020
No, let me do it.

311
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:20,020
You're the one who put it on my shoulder.

312
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:23,020
Are you sick?

313
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:24,020
You're old.

314
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:25,020
You're old.

315
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:28,020
You're old.

316
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:32,020
But I might get angry if I say it like this,

317
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:34,020
but that crow is a little...

318
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:36,020
It's a little...

319
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:37,020
It's a joke.

320
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:39,020
It's a joke.

321
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:40,020
Is that so?

322
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:42,020
That's not really stuck.

323
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:44,020
It's not stuck.

324
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:46,020
No, I've been a little weak lately.

325
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:48,020
I've been holding my legs.

326
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:51,020
I've been acting a little too much.

327
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:54,020
That crow is a little too much.

328
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:56,020
My sister's been taken from the side.

329
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:57,020
Think about it.

330
00:11:57,020 --> 00:12:01,020
You can't say that for a week without getting through to your body.

331
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:04,020
No, well, that's a good thing.

332
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:07,020
That's a good thing.

333
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:08,020
That's a good thing.

334
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:10,020
You can't get through.

335
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:13,020
That's a good thing.

336
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:17,020
It's just that it's not as bad as it seems.

337
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:19,020
If it had been like that forever, it wouldn't have happened.

338
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:20,020
It would have been pulled out.

339
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:23,020
That's why when everyone saw it,

340
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:24,020
it was stuck.

341
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:25,020
It was stuck.

342
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:27,020
Why do you decide on your own like that?

343
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:29,020
No, I just saw it.

344
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:31,020
It's stuck.

345
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:35,020
So you don't even know if that's a crow or not.

346
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:38,020
I don't know what the maid wrote.

347
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:41,020
I'm sure it's a crow.

348
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:46,020
It's been stuck in my back since I was born.

349
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:48,020
Yeah, I guess so.

350
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:50,020
That's not true.

351
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:52,020
That's the only thing I can think of.

352
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:56,020
No, that's why it was shot.

353
00:12:56,020 --> 00:13:01,020
It was shot, so it's stuck in his back.

354
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:04,020
You don't even know if it was shot or not.

355
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:07,020
What, are you doing this yourself?

356
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:10,020
Around here.

357
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:13,020
That's a little weird, isn't it?

358
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:15,020
Well, you're doing your best, aren't you?

359
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:16,020
You brought the net and said,

360
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:17,020
I don't know what to do.

361
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:18,020
It's stupid, isn't it?

362
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:21,020
That animal is like that.

363
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:25,020
I thought I'd saved it, but it ran away.

364
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:27,020
I don't know what to do.

365
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:30,020
Why do you have to catch it with such a big net?

366
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:31,020
Is it that hard?

367
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:34,020
It's so close.

368
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:36,020
Why do you have to make such a big net?

369
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:38,020
I can't do that.

370
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:39,020
I'm afraid I'll be taken to the hospital.

371
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:41,020
Why don't you do it?

372
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:43,020
It's so easy to hold.

373
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:45,020
I can't do it.

374
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:46,020
I can't catch it.

375
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:47,020
I'm going home.

376
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:49,020
I'm going home.

377
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:51,020
I'm going home.

378
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:53,020
He's going to jump, isn't he?

379
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:55,020
I'm going to jump, isn't he?

380
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:57,020
He's going to jump, isn't he?

381
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:59,020
He's in a good mood.

382
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:01,020
That's good.

383
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:03,020
He's in a good mood.

384
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:05,020
He's in a good mood.

385
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:07,020
I was somewhere again today.

386
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:08,020
What?

387
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:09,020
I don't know.

388
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:12,020
Can you shoot?

389
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:16,020
I can't shoot during the show.

390
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:19,020
The enemy is attacking us suddenly.

391
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:22,020
When the enemy attacks us from the front,

392
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:27,020
I thought he was my enemy, but I couldn't do it.

393
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:34,020
That's his weapon.

394
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:38,020
That's his weapon.

395
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:41,020
I thought it would be fine if I tried it once.

396
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:43,020
It hurts.

397
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:45,020
It hurts.

398
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:47,020
No, no, no, no, no.

399
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:50,020
What are you talking about?

400
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:52,020
I'll tell you something.

401
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:55,020
If you don't have a mouse, you'll be lonely even with a cat.

402
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,020
That's right.

403
00:14:56,020 --> 00:15:01,020
So if you chase it to the corner, it will run away at first, but if you think you can't do it anymore, it will run away.

404
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:03,020
Will it come out?

405
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:06,020
Isn't it like this?

406
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:07,020
What is this?

407
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:08,020
Like this.

408
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:10,020
Oh, like this.

409
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:14,020
Question.

410
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:17,020
What kind of bridge does Akiko Wada use?

411
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:20,020
Is it a bridge?

412
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:23,020
Don't get angry.

413
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:27,020
Don't attack.

414
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:30,020
I'll keep it quiet.

415
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:34,020
I've been watching that guy a lot.

416
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:38,020
I was saying something like that the other day.

417
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:41,020
I was writing a phone call for the New Year.

418
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:43,020
I'm not sleeping.

419
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:48,020
It's quiet.

420
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:50,020
You're not sleeping.

421
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:53,020
It's quiet.

422
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:59,020
Even if I tell you how I'm doing, you won't tell me to do this.

423
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:00,020
I'm not sleeping.

424
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:03,020
I haven't slept since 7 o'clock last night.

425
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:04,020
Is that so?

426
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:05,020
Wait a minute.

427
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:07,020
There's someone who didn't sleep with me.

428
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:09,020
It's Mr. Tokomitsu.

429
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:12,020
Mr. Tokomitsu was caught last night.

430
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:15,020
I'm sorry, Hama-chan.

431
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:21,020
We've been together all the time.

432
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:22,020
Is that so?

433
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:24,020
I won't be able to go home.

434
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:26,020
That's right.

435
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:29,020
I'm about to cry.

436
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:31,020
I won't touch you anymore.

437
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:33,020
Don't touch me.

438
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:35,020
I'm going to tell you something else.

439
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:36,020
Yes.

440
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:38,020
What is this?

441
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:39,020
Pen name.

442
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:42,020
Mr. Makuri Mukatsuki?

443
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:45,020
It's a cypress.

444
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:50,020
It's a challenge corner with a quiz for Machanin.

445
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:52,020
Who's going to challenge?

446
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:53,020
Art.

447
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:54,020
E.

448
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:55,020
U.

449
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:56,020
A.

450
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:57,020
O.

451
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:58,020
100m.

452
00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:59,020
We've competed.

453
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:04,020
Now, who will be the first to reach the goal?

454
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:11,020
Thinking time!

455
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:13,020
I don't want to do it.

456
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:18,020
I don't want to do it if you give me a hug.

457
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:20,020
Answer!

458
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:22,020
The answer is...

459
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:23,020
E.

460
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:25,020
E.

461
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:26,020
U.

462
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:28,020
100m.

463
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:37,020
Yay, yay, yay!

464
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:39,020
I have a question for you.

465
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:42,020
Even if you bite your nose, nose water will come out again.

466
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:44,020
Where does this nose water come from?

467
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:47,020
Why does nose water exist?

468
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:51,020
Please tell me.

469
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:53,020
Nose water?

470
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:57,020
I'm about to cry.

471
00:17:57,020 --> 00:18:03,020
That's why it's some kind of information.

472
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:09,020
I understand that your body is in bad shape.

473
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:14,020
If you say that kind of information, I understand.

474
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:17,020
Are you drunk?

475
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:20,020
I don't say that kind of information.

476
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:21,020
That's right.

477
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:25,020
I'm a shogun.

478
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:28,020
I look at your face.

479
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:31,020
That kind of information.

480
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:34,020
I'll give you a kiss.

481
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:36,020
A kiss?

482
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:40,020
I'm scared.

483
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:41,020
Why?

484
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:43,020
Your body is in bad shape.

485
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:45,020
That kind of information.

486
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:48,020
Does it come out in that sense?

487
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:55,020
Nose water is a waste of water in your body.

488
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:56,020
It's a waste of water?

489
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:58,020
It's a waste of water.

490
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:04,020
When you drink too much water, it becomes nose water.

491
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:06,020
That's not true.

492
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:07,020
Why?

493
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:09,020
Why does it come out as nose water?

494
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:11,020
It's a waste of water.

495
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:16,020
Why does it come out as nose water?

496
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:19,020
Nose water is the sweat of the heart.

497
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:21,020
What?

498
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:26,020
I don't understand if you say tears.

499
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:28,020
Nose water is the sweat of the heart.

500
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:33,020
It comes out when it hurts the heart.

501
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:40,020
Ouch!

502
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:44,020
What is the biggest volume of the TV for?

503
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:49,020
Is there anyone who watches TV with the biggest volume?

504
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:52,020
I said this before.

505
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:56,020
The volume changes when you watch a normal program and when it becomes a commercial.

506
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:58,020
It changes.

507
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:03,020
I don't know if it's a big deal if it becomes a commercial even if I watch it at a cafe.

508
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:05,020
I want you to stop that.

509
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:07,020
I want you to stop that.

510
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:11,020
It's a big mistake if you think the product will sell with that.

511
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:15,020
I want you to stop that.

512
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:18,020
You should stop that.

513
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:23,020
People are more interested in the smaller one.

514
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:31,020
When it suddenly becomes a commercial, it's hard to understand what you're looking at.

515
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:32,020
The picture is out.

516
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:38,020
The picture is out, but I think it's the opposite.

517
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:41,020
Everyone is doing the opposite.

518
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:44,020
You compare it with other products.

519
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:46,020
My detergent is better than yours.

520
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:49,020
It's the opposite.

521
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:52,020
My detergent is better than yours.

522
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:53,020
It's funny.

523
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:56,020
It's funny, so it's funny.

524
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:57,020
It's not falling at all.

525
00:20:57,020 --> 00:21:01,020
It's not falling at all.

526
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:04,020
It's the worst.

527
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:07,020
It's the worst detergent.

528
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:11,020
It's the worst detergent.

529
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:20,020
You know, there are many companies that offer this program.

530
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:25,020
But you can't tell me one of them.

531
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:27,020
You can't tell me one of them.

532
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:31,020
You can't tell me one of them.

533
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:35,020
You can't tell me one of them.

534
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:38,020
Why can't you tell me one of them?

535
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:40,020
It's a broadcast code.

536
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:42,020
Why?

537
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:45,020
It's on the screen.

538
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:46,020
It's similar.

539
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:49,020
Isn't it the same in the theater?

540
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:50,020
What's the difference?

541
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:51,020
What?

542
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:56,020
The beauty of ice is from Shinjuku.

543
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:58,020
Oh, in the adult movie.

544
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:59,020
In the adult movie.

545
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:00,020
In the adult movie.

546
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:01,020
In the adult movie.

547
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:02,020
In the adult movie.

548
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:03,020
Yes.

549
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:04,020
That's it.

550
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:06,020
That's it.

551
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:08,020
If we had a sponsor, we wouldn't have.

552
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:09,020
We all have our own companies.

553
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:17,920
Some companies who don't allow people to use the program are like Ин våeye

554
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:20,920
Ин oureya.

555
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,920
Is there such a company?

556
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:25,920
Isn't that kind of salesman cool?

557
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:53,400
Thank you for your viewing.
