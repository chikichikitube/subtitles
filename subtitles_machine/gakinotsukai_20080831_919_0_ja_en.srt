1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,840
Your guest почти never comes.

2
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:01,920
Your guest

3
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:02,460
It's an rare occasion.

4
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:03,280
It's rare for the host to come.

5
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:04,220
It's an increased sight.

6
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:04,840
Oh.

7
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:05,380
Oh no!

8
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:06,240
This!

9
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,580
Oh, it's good.

10
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:09,480
You are宅者?

11
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:12,340
Well, I'm here to raise the ratings.

12
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:13,480
Watch...

13
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,220
At at this rate,

14
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:04,200
it'll be

15
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:18,180
completely voted out.

16
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:20,180
It'll be so hot.

17
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:21,460
Even if they come in without a gun,

18
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:23,700
they'll come in without a handgun.

19
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:25,620
They'll hit storm from the middle.

20
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:26,740
Right.

21
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:28,120
Oh, I'd like to publicly announce this.

22
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:28,840
Sure.

23
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:33,840
From August 30th, the 26th, it will be shown on the screen.

24
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,840
It's the best show.

25
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,840
Everyone who is watching, please watch it on the theater.

26
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:40,840
Mr. Hakuto?

27
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:41,840
Yes.

28
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,840
The first show...

29
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:44,840
6 billion.

30
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,840
6 billion!

31
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:49,840
My character will be 5.3 billion.

32
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,840
12 billion?

33
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,840
I don't want to do it.

34
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,840
I'm sorry.

35
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:56,840
Then, do you want to go?

36
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:57,840
Where?

37
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,840
Shouji-san's place?

38
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:00,340
Yes.

39
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:01,840
We're going to Shouji-san's place.

40
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:02,840
It's been a while.

41
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:03,840
Everyone's here.

42
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:04,840
What's this?

43
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,840
This is the Maiko-han Classroom.

44
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,840
I don't like it every time, but if you call me, I can't help it.

45
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,840
You've come all the way, so let's go together.

46
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:12,840
Let's go now!

47
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,840
Once you get hooked, it's annoying.

48
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:25,840
So, Toshiaki Karasawa decided to participate in the class of Maiko-han.

49
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,840
It's a good day.

50
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,840
It's a good day.

51
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,840
It's better than I thought.

52
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,840
It's better than I thought.

53
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,840
I'm a little nervous.

54
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:47,840
No problem.

55
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,840
Wow, a shrine.

56
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:51,840
It says here.

57
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,840
The Maiko-han room is here.

58
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,840
Maiko-han room?

59
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,840
It's like I'm always being cursed.

60
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,840
I see.

61
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,840
Unless it's a tatami room, it's not organized.

62
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,840
Is there anything to do outside?

63
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,840
On the contrary.

64
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:11,840
Hey!

65
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,840
Wake up!

66
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,840
Oh, scary.

67
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,840
Scary.

68
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,840
Oh, scary.

69
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,840
Oh, scary.

70
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,840
I was told to come here by the god of the waterfall.

71
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,840
What a coincidence.

72
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,840
Good morning.

73
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,840
Good morning.

74
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,840
Good morning.

75
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:39,840
The one who appeared in the video was the famous Shochu Murakami.

76
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:40,920
feel free.

77
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,200
Would you like to page全  mechanic in the class?

78
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:48,340
Oh! Brother knows it himself!

79
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,620
He is the brother of the beginner teacher.

80
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,020
Oh! Yeah.

81
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:58,780
He is cool!

82
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02,980
But he pays attention to the details Because there are many old shoes.

83
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,460
I understand.

84
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:06,460
What?

85
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:10,460
This time, you're the teacher for the second half of the class.

86
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:11,460
Yes.

87
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:12,460
Excuse me, miss.

88
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:13,460
What?

89
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:15,460
There's one more student today.

90
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:16,460
Yes.

91
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:17,460
Oh, really?

92
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:18,460
Eh?

93
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:20,460
Is it spicy?

94
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:21,460
Yes.

95
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:22,460
It's spicy.

96
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:24,460
I don't think you know me.

97
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:26,460
Thank you.

98
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:27,460
I'm Koinon.

99
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:28,460
Thank you.

100
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:29,460
Eh?

101
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:30,460
That's my name.

102
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,460
That's your name.

103
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:33,460
Oh, it's Onokaga-san.

104
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:35,460
Onokaga-san.

105
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:39,460
If you can sell it at a gachiki, you can name it like this.

106
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:41,460
This is the back.

107
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:43,460
It's white.

108
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:44,460
What is this?

109
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:48,460
This is the number 575 that the president would be happy with.

110
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:50,460
575?

111
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:52,460
Something like that.

112
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:54,460
I'll be in your care today.

113
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:55,460
Yes, please.

114
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:59,340
You're a

115
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:02,340
I don't treat you like a special person.

116
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:04,340
What should I do if I don't want to do it?

117
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:06,340
Go home!

118
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:08,340
Get out of the main office!

119
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:09,340
I don't have time for that.

120
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:11,340
Get out of the main office!

121
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:15,340
I'm sorry, but Mr. Yamazaki asked me to come here.

122
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:18,340
Oh, Yamazaki-chan.

123
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:20,340
What?

124
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:24,340
Your father was arrested for life for this case.

125
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:27,340
And you didn't hear anything?

126
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:30,340
It's not organized at all.

127
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:34,340
The hair of Maiko is pulling.

128
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:38,340
The Kyoto vegetables are running away.

129
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:43,340
I was doing such a silly thing, so it became a permanent report.

130
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:48,340
Maiko's items are usually scents.

131
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:53,340
It's a tool to make it look colorful.

132
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:55,340
Oh, sorry.

133
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:57,340
Hama-yako?

134
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:59,340
En-yako?

135
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,340
Thank you.

136
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:03,340
Matsu-yako?

137
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:05,340
Matsu-yako.

138
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:07,340
And...

139
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:09,340
Tai-yako?

140
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:11,340
Tai-yako.

141
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:15,340
You're new here, so I didn't think you'd come.

142
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:17,340
Here.

143
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:19,340
Sorry I'm late.

144
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:21,340
Excuse me.

145
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:23,340
I don't have any.

146
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:24,340
What?

147
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:25,340
I don't have any.

148
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:27,340
Hoshin-kun?

149
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:28,340
Yes?

150
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:30,340
Bring it on.

151
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:31,340
What?

152
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:32,340
Bring it on!

153
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:33,340
I'll give it to you.

154
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:34,340
Go away.

155
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:35,340
Don't you need it?

156
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:37,340
You should take it.

157
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:39,340
Go away.

158
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:49,340
The sense of the game is...

159
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:51,340
This must be for sure.

160
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:53,340
No doubt.

161
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:55,340
It's definitely for sure.

162
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:57,340
Think it's a plate number.

163
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:59,340
What did you say?

164
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:01,340
I think it's a plate number.

165
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:05,340
What plate number?

166
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:07,340
There is a drawer like this.

167
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:09,340
This is a lot of things.

168
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:11,340
They are stored here.

169
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:13,340
There's a drawer like this.

170
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:15,340
It's fun to have a story like that.

171
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,340
The basic of Maiko-han is to sing.

172
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:28,340
Finally, the practice at the ozashiki begins.

173
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:33,340
This time, we're going to do it at the ozashiki.

174
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:36,340
Actually, it's still early.

175
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:41,340
Matsuyako, what kind of Maiko do you want to be?

176
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:45,340
I want to be a Maiko who is loved by everyone.

177
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:47,340
No!

178
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:51,340
I want to be a Maiko who is good at singing.

179
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:53,340
I'm sorry.

180
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:54,340
I'm...

181
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:56,340
I'm not.

182
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:58,340
Mr. Toyokazu.

183
00:06:58,340 --> 00:06:59,340
I'm not.

184
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:00,340
Mr. Toyokazu.

185
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:02,340
I'm going to be the president.

186
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:03,340
Yes.

187
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:05,340
I want to be a good guy.

188
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:07,340
Is this a joke?

189
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:09,340
Is this a joke?

190
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:11,340
I've never heard of Matsuyoko-san.

191
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:13,340
Enyakko.

192
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:15,340
I've never heard of it.

193
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:21,340
What's your name?

194
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:23,340
Enyakko.

195
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:25,340
Excuse me.

196
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:27,340
Look at this.

197
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:29,340
It's good.

198
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:31,340
It's good to drink it from the side.

199
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:33,340
It's not a bar.

200
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:35,340
You're a good painter.

201
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:43,340
You're even a teacher.

202
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:44,340
That's amazing.

203
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:45,340
Thank you.

204
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:46,340
Seriously.

205
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,340
Oh, you.

206
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:49,340
Here.

207
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:50,340
I'll drink it.

208
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:52,340
Good luck.

209
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:53,340
You're a good girl.

210
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,340
Can I have a drink?

211
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:56,340
Here.

212
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:18,340
What's with that funny way of eating?

213
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:21,340
Well, it's just a man's habit.

214
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:23,340
There are a lot of people who want to drink with this kind of thing.

215
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:24,340
Oh, really?

216
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:26,340
What are you talking about?

217
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:30,340
The president is doing this and that.

218
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:36,340
You guys say it, but don't say it.

219
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:39,340
This is a project.

220
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:41,340
Yamada Yuki.

221
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:43,340
Can you do it?

222
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:44,340
Yes, I can.

223
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:45,340
Alright.

224
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:49,340
You do this.

225
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:51,340
You stand up.

226
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:55,340
Stand up.

227
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:58,340
Stand up.

228
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:00,340
There are people who love this.

229
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:05,340
Wait a minute.

230
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:06,340
Wait a minute.

231
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:10,340
Have you finished your beer?

232
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:11,340
Gari!

233
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:12,340
Yes.

234
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:13,340
Yes, I'm sorry.

235
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:14,340
I'm...

236
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:22,340
Look.

237
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:25,340
This is totally different from the others.

238
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:29,340
You're just full of excuses!

239
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:32,340
Hot is hot!

240
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:34,340
Cold is cold!

241
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:38,340
The kids in the blue floor are all hot!

242
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:39,920
Exactly...

243
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,340
I wonder how many words of render...

244
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:45,920
are used by the Japaneseller...

245
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,300
OK???

246
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,500
Are you ready?

247
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,280
Funds are NTDs

248
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,800
It is expensive

249
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,260
The meal transports the dishes

250
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:05,820
It is an important job

251
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:08,820
This is the example of cooking.

252
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:14,820
This is the president's favorite.

253
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:16,820
It's quite a secret.

254
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:17,820
It's morning.

255
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:18,820
It's like breakfast.

256
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:19,820
Secret?

257
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:23,820
Can you say that to the phone?

258
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:26,820
I can't eat this.

259
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:32,820
The distance to the kitchen is 20 meters.

260
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:37,820
First, he quickly prepares the salad for the dish.

261
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:40,820
He quickly passes the average amount.

262
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:45,820
And before he arrives at the house, he does a simple dish-washing.

263
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:50,820
Finally, he cleans the slide and delivers it to the house.

264
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:55,820
The president is tired from work, so he's hungry.

265
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:59,820
He can't go to work early, he's like a demon.

266
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,820
I'm ready.

267
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:03,820
First, Hamayako will challenge.

268
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:09,820
She and the other members will aim for the house.

269
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:14,820
Ready, start!

270
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:19,820
Good luck, Hamayako!

271
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,820
Fast, fast!

272
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:23,820
Fast, fast!

273
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:27,820
He is waiting for you.

274
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:30,820
Be careful.

275
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,820
Stand in line.

276
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:35,820
Eat bread there.

277
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:40,820
Don't take the sword.

278
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:42,820
He is waiting for you.

279
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:44,820
He is ready.

280
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,820
He is ready.

281
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:48,820
He is ready.

282
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:50,820
He is ready.

283
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:55,820
Are you okay, Hamayako?

284
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:59,820
Ouch!

285
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:03,820
Ouch!

286
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:06,820
Ouch!

287
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:08,820
Oh!

288
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:11,820
Oh!

289
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,820
It hurts!

290
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,820
Are you okay?

291
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,820
I'm fine!

292
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:33,820
I'm glad I saw it!

293
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,820
Next!

294
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:37,820
Next!

295
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:39,820
Next!

296
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:41,820
Do your best!

297
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:43,820
Do your best!

298
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:45,820
Do your best!

299
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:47,820
Take care of him!

300
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:49,820
Please!

301
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:51,820
Please!

302
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:53,820
Do your best!

303
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,820
Ready!

304
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:57,820
Start!

305
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:59,820
Do your best!

306
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,820
You're doing great!

307
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:03,820
This is not the kind of movie you make for this.

308
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:05,820
Do your best!

309
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,820
Do your best!

310
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,820
I'm going to get over the wall and run.

311
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:11,820
Come on, Kintou.

312
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:13,820
You're running and you're running.

313
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:15,820
Oh, that's good, Karayako.

314
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:17,820
That's good.

315
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:19,820
That's good.

316
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:21,820
That's good.

317
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:23,820
I'm hungry.

318
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:25,820
Karayako, are you okay?

319
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:27,820
I'm fine.

320
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:29,820
Karayako, are you okay?

321
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:33,820
Amazing.

322
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:35,820
That's amazing.

323
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,820
I want to do a perfect jump!

324
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:39,820
That's amazing!

325
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,820
How much more do you want to jump?

326
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:43,820
I'm going to do it!

327
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:04,820
Are you okay?

328
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:06,820
Thank you for waiting.

329
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:08,820
You passed.

330
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,820
You're amazing, Hamayako.

331
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:12,820
You're amazing, Hamayako.

332
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:14,820
You're amazing, Hamayako.

333
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:16,820
What's wrong with you?

334
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:21,820
You're not going to get any more of that.

335
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,820
I'm sorry, I'll do my best.

336
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,820
What do you mean by that?

337
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:27,820
You're a punishment.

338
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:29,820
This.

339
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:32,820
I'll bet on it.

340
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:36,820
No, no, no.

341
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:41,820
If you do it properly, it will be the responsibility of everyone.

342
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:42,820
Yes, yes.

343
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:49,820
Next is the night training of Maiko who can't do it if her body is stiff.

344
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:53,820
I'm Maiko, so I'm a virgin.

345
00:14:53,820 --> 00:15:01,820
I'll be the boss and you'll be called from the next room.

346
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:03,820
You'll refuse it.

347
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:08,820
If you refuse it, the boss will come to play in various places.

348
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:17,820
Snacks from the guard, cabaret club, and the last place to go is this showroom.

349
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:22,820
I know. If you refuse it, you'll be hugged.

350
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:26,820
Matsumoto, you are the best!

351
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:28,820
I'll do my best!

352
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:30,820
Matsuyako, you can do it!

353
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:32,820
Matsuyako, you're here!

354
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:34,820
How are you?

355
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:36,820
I'm getting used to it.

356
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:38,820
Really?

357
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:40,820
How are you?

358
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:46,820
I'm very happy, but I'm a little bit...

359
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:51,820
I don't care about you.

360
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:55,820
But I'm so embarrassed.

361
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:57,820
What are you embarrassed about?

362
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:59,820
Because I pulled your bath towel.

363
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:01,820
No, no, no.

364
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:05,820
I don't want to see your bath towel.

365
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:07,820
You're so annoying.

366
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:09,820
What's wrong with you?

367
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:10,820
I'm sorry.

368
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:11,820
What's that?

369
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:12,820
I'm sorry.

370
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:14,820
You're so rude.

371
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:16,820
I'll go to the car and come back.

372
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:20,820
What do you think is the best way?

373
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:24,820
You'll feel sorry for me if I do that.

374
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:26,820
Let's do it.

375
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:27,820
Yes.

376
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:29,820
I'll do it.

377
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:30,820
Yes.

378
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:31,820
Please.

379
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:32,820
Please show me.

380
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:33,820
Excuse me.

381
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:34,820
Excuse me.

382
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,820
Thank you for your help.

383
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:38,820
You're welcome.

384
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:40,820
What is it?

385
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:42,820
I want to sleep with you.

386
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:44,820
Please stop.

387
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:48,820
Actually, I have a broken rib.

388
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:50,820
A broken rib?

389
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:51,820
Yes, a broken rib.

390
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:53,820
I have a scar on my back.

391
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:55,820
What is that?

392
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,820
Don't lie to me.

393
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:58,820
My butt is dirty.

394
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:01,820
My butt is dirty.

395
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:04,820
My back is really stiff.

396
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:07,820
Please stop.

397
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:09,820
Amazing!

398
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:15,820
The training is coming to an end, and the rest of the training is in the blink of an eye.

399
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:20,820
It seems that you don't need to add anything to this.

400
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:29,820
I'll practice it right away.

401
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:31,820
Look.

402
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:34,820
Try to follow me.

403
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:37,820
It's a revenge.

404
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:55,820
Where are you following me?

405
00:17:55,820 --> 00:18:00,820
This is my first time, so I always bring my paper cup here.

406
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:04,820
Don't just come to the scene like that.

407
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:07,820
Do you understand?

408
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:08,820
No, I don't understand.

409
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:09,820
If...

410
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:14,820
Tanaka.

411
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:15,820
Yes.

412
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:18,820
Please tell me what I should do.

413
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:19,820
You did your best.

414
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:21,820
I don't understand, but...

415
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:26,820
So, you're trying to change the atmosphere?

416
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:36,820
What was that?

417
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:40,820
It sounded like a cross chop.

418
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:41,820
Really?

419
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:42,820
What about you, Mayuko?

420
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:43,820
A cross chop?

421
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:44,820
I just did a cross chop.

422
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:47,820
You're not going anywhere!

423
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:49,820
No, I'm not going anywhere.

424
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:51,820
Let's go to the next one.

425
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:58,820
In any situation, the lost person has to go to the house.

426
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:03,820
Today is a good day, and the summer is hot.

427
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:06,820
The season is very stormy.

428
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:08,820
It's a land like that.

429
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:13,820
No matter what happens, I will go to the president's house.

430
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:16,820
Today, I will set it up as a storm.

431
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:19,820
Who wants to do this?

432
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:21,820
Oh, right!

433
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:24,820
Kana-san, you're a newbie.

434
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:25,820
Come here.

435
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:27,820
Kanae-ko, do your best.

436
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:28,820
Do your best, Kanae-ko.

437
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:29,820
Kanae-ko, you're a newbie.

438
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:32,820
Shall we do it together?

439
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:33,820
Are we doing it together?

440
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:35,820
In short, we'll do this.

441
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:37,820
This time, let's do it like this.

442
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:38,820
Ready, set, go!

443
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:40,820
Men's match!

444
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:41,820
Okay.

445
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:43,820
Men's match.

446
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:49,820
You can choose 5 people.

447
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:53,820
You can't judge a person by a woman.

448
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:56,820
The man you judge is a man.

449
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:58,820
I think a man is good.

450
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:02,820
If you judge a woman, she is good.

451
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:06,820
The one who has more applause wins.

452
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:08,820
The one who has less applause loses.

453
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:10,820
The one who loses will do this.

454
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:17,820
First, I think that the manly one is better than the manly one.

455
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:23,820
That's enough.

456
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:26,820
I don't know.

457
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:29,820
With such a applause,

458
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:33,820
Now, the one who thinks the wind is better, please come forward.

459
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:42,820
I lost.

460
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:45,820
It was perfect.

461
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:51,820
I thought I could bring it to the end, but the last one, the clapping,

462
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:53,820
at least, there was something like,

463
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:55,820
I've already won twice.

464
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:59,820
Let's do the storm.

465
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:01,820
That's right.

466
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:08,820
I'll show you how much I'm always ready.

467
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:12,820
I can't do it with a wind.

468
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:17,820
Please look at the heart of the microphone.

469
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,220
Hey!

470
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,520
Stop there!

471
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:29,960
They've got laughter!

472
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,960
It's cold!

473
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,960
It's cold!

474
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,960
We've reached Odachi.

475
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,960
Just a little more.

476
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,960
Mom, I'm too hot!

477
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,960
Here it comes!

478
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,960
Lady, the roof is on fire!

479
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,960
It's amazing.

480
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,960
I'm glad to hear that.

481
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,960
I've been a member of the National Band for a long time.

482
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,960
Shall we go?

483
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,960
No, not yet.

484
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:33,960
I'm still thinking about my last mission.

485
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,960
Yes, yes.

486
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:44,960
President, do you know how many people are in the investigation team?

487
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:53,540
Thank you for watching!
