1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
I don't do that!

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
You're a mysterious transfer student!

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I'm sitting here with Yamazaki

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I thought it would be better to find a partner

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Even if I'm doing it alone

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I'm much less popular than when I was in Team Zero

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Really?

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
How about you? Do you feel that you're getting less popular?

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Yes

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I really don't want to do it

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm a fool

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I want to be in the spotlight

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I want to be in the spotlight too

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
What do you mean?

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
It's like you're a fool

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm already a fool

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm already in the spotlight

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
There are people who say that

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Yes, there are people who say that

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
But there are people around me

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Takasu and I are good friends

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Right?

23
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Yes

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
What are you talking about?

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Takasu is a former nabe pro

26
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm a soccer player

27
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
But sometimes I get the feeling that I want to do it

28
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Right?

29
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Say it

30
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I don't want to be in the spotlight

31
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I don't want to be in the spotlight

32
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I don't want to be in the spotlight

33
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Actually, the target of this prank is Producer Suga

34
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Looking back on his childhood, his star quality is very high

35
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
And his popularity is rising

36
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
He doesn't seem to be a fool

37
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000
This is the script of this time to trick him into becoming a star

38
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Will Suga-chan be able to get along with Yamazaki?

39
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
He's like our boss

40
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:57,000
What do you think about Suga-san becoming a star after becoming a staff member?

41
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I'm very happy about it

42
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Because he's the next star after becoming a staff member

43
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
That's right

44
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I don't think it's the other way around

45
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
That's right

46
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
There was a time when Saito was famous

47
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
He was a star

48
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
There are times like that

49
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I think I failed

50
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
There are times like that

51
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:25,000
But I think I can do it if I do it with this person

52
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
You think so?

53
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Yes

54
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
He's in here

55
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
He's in here

56
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
May I?

57
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
What are you talking about?

58
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
May I announce it?

59
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I'll announce it

60
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I really want to do it with Suga-san

61
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
He's a long-time friend

62
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I see

63
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Suga-chan is a long-time friend

64
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Okay, I got it

65
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
You have to respect his will

66
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Can you give him a joke?

67
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I have a joke that warms me up

68
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I have a joke that warms me up

69
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I'm going to do it today

70
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
He said he's going to do it today

71
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Give him a joke

72
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Okay

73
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
You want to do it too, right?

74
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Yes, I want to do it

75
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Okay

76
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I'm going to do it tomorrow

77
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I'm going to read it first

78
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I want money

79
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Suga-chan is really into pranks

80
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
That's the difference between him and the producer

81
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Is it for the show?

82
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Or is it just for the stars?

83
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
The more he talks about it, the more he gets excited

84
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
It's the first stage of the new couple who are looking forward to downtown

85
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:45,000
It's the second stage of the new couple who are looking forward to downtown

86
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
It's the second time

87
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
You like to say that

88
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Why? It's different

89
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
It's a little different from your face at the opening

90
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I want you to say it

91
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I don't want to say it

92
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Don't say that

93
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I want you to react

94
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I really like it when you say it

95
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I like it even more

96
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Normally when a talent goes to a night club

97
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
People will come and put up a rope

98
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
They'll say, don't go over there anymore

99
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
They'll come

100
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I know, I know

101
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
He'll get drunk

102
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
He'll get drunk and get in the car

103
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I want you to say it a little more

104
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
He's so annoying

105
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I really like it

106
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I like it as much as you like it

107
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
It's different

108
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I don't like it when you say it

109
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
There's something on your face

110
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
It's the skin

111
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
The skin is peeling off

112
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I'm waiting for the opening again

113
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I really don't like it

114
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
It's only here on your face

115
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
When you turn your face

116
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
It's gone

117
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Wait a minute

118
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Inside?

119
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Inside already

120
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I'm looking out the window

121
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Why?

122
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Why?

123
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I don't like it

124
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
It's not like that

125
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I'm working hard

126
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
You are

127
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I peel off the apples

128
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Do you have a water bug?

129
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I don't

130
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
You don't?

131
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
It's a water bug's

132
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
You all know this, right?

133
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
What's that?

134
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
It's not a mold?

135
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
It's a mold

136
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
You wipe your feet

137
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I think that's why it's like this

138
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
It's not a weird disease

139
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
It's not a weird disease

140
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
It's not sick at all

141
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
It's sick

142
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Why is it like this inside?

143
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Boku-chan is like that

144
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
What's Boku-chan?

145
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I'm very excited

146
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
You are

147
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
You are fine

148
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
The important thing is that it's not sick

149
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Everyone has it

150
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
You have it too, right?

151
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
It's red

152
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
It hurts

153
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
It's scary

154
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Stop it

155
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
It's too red

156
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Are you still doing that?

157
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
You are 30 years old

158
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
You have children

159
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,000
You are Hamada-san, right?

160
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
You have to do your best

161
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
You are not a newcomer

162
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
You have to do your best like a newcomer

163
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
That's right

164
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Right?

165
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
You don't have many customers today, right?

166
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I don't

167
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Why?

168
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I don't know

169
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Are you not popular anymore?

170
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
What are you going to do?

171
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
If you are not popular anymore

172
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
It's hard

173
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
It's hard

174
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
No one can say anything about you

175
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I'll treat you like a normal person

176
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
You'll treat me like a normal person

177
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
There are a lot of comedians like that

178
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Who?

179
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I'm going to be deceived by your applause

180
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
You are going to be deceived by my applause

181
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I'm going to be deceived by your applause

182
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,000
There are a lot of people who are not on TV anymore

183
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
But you are like that

184
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
You are like a trendy actor

185
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Who?

186
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
What?

187
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
That's not true

188
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
What?

189
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Who?

190
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Who said that?

191
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Nanjo Yutaka

192
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Who?

193
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
That was years ago

194
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
You were riding a horse with Momoe

195
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
That's a long time ago

196
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
That's right

197
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
You were a trendy actor

198
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
You were a trendy actor

199
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Do you know who is popular now?

200
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
It's your son, right?

201
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
That's right

202
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
He is always in a bad mood and makes a record

203
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I don't understand

204
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
How many times did you say the same phrase?

205
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Are you a fool?

206
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
And also

207
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
What kind of makeup are you wearing?

208
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Who is he?

209
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Why is he wearing a shadow?

210
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
But he is popular, right?

211
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
He is popular

212
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
You know that drama

213
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Recently, there is a drama called Ani

214
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Really?

215
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
What? Your lover is small?

216
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
What?

217
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Don't spit it out

218
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
What are you doing?

219
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
You are watching it

220
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I'll get back to the topic

221
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Do you hate him that much?

222
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I don't hate him

223
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
He is doing his best

224
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
What if he doesn't do anything?

225
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
What if he doesn't do anything?

226
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
For example, if he comes from the hallway of Shakespeare

227
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
If he hits you

228
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
If you say sorry and try to go

229
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
That's not good

230
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
You shouldn't do that

231
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:26,000
That's not good

232
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Do you want to go to the hair salon?

233
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
That's not good

234
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
But it will happen

235
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
If you do the same thing

236
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
How?

237
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
If you hit him

238
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
If you say sorry

239
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
What will you do?

240
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
But if you hit him like that

241
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
What will you do?

242
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
That's not good

243
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
That's not good

244
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
That's not good

245
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
That's not good

246
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I don't hate him that much

247
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I want to write it

248
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Kick

249
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Last week, it was cut

250
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I kicked it

251
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Sorry

252
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Hey

253
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Did you lower your head to the AD?

254
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I have one last question

255
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
The debut single of Geisha Girls is only available in America

256
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
It doesn't sell in Japan

257
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I really want it, please think about it

258
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Do you want it?

259
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
We are going to be in New York

260
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
You guys

261
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Recording

262
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Ryuichi

263
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
He made 2 songs

264
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Ryuichi said he wants to make 2 songs

265
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Ryuichi is amazing

266
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
He said he wants at least 1 week

267
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
That's

268
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
That's impossible

269
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
He can finish it in a day

270
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
What?

271
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
If you ask me if it doesn't sell in Japan

272
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
It doesn't sell

273
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
It doesn't sell in Japan

274
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
It doesn't sell in Japan

275
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
He's strong

276
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
But the audience will be like

277
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
What's wrong with me?

278
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
That's what I think

279
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I'm telling you to be careful

280
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I want you to say that

281
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I'm a bad guy

282
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
It doesn't sell in Japan

283
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
What?

284
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Shut up

285
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
A chicken's leg has one claw

286
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:56,000
There's one in this picture

287
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Really?

288
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,000
There's one here

289
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
It doesn't touch the ground

290
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
It doesn't mean anything

291
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Why is it there?

292
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
It doesn't mean anything

293
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
That's not true

294
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Then what is it?

295
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I'm going to ask

296
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Do you know Takayaba Kiribasami?

297
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
It's Takaeda

298
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
There's Takaeda

299
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
It's a better one

300
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
It's better than Takaeda

301
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I know

302
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
What is it?

303
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Speak

304
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
You'll understand

305
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
You don't need words

306
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
What is it?

307
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I'm sorry

308
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I'm sorry

309
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
What is it?

310
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
It's like a switch

311
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:24,000
If you press it, the leg goes like this

312
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Why?

313
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
What's there to press?

314
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
The bird does it

315
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Did you kill it?

316
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
When you try to grab something

317
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
A small hand comes out

318
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
If you pull it, it goes like this

319
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
What's a small hand?

320
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
This hasn't been solved yet

321
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
That's what it does?

322
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
That's not it

323
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
That's also a bird

324
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
This is all a bird

325
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
That's right

326
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
What about this?

327
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
You said this is also a bird

328
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
This is also a bird

329
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
It's a different word

330
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
You're human, right?

331
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
This is human

332
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
What?

333
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
This is also human

334
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
This is human

335
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
That's not it

336
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I don't know

337
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I don't know

338
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Elvis

339
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Elvis Presby

340
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Elvis Presby

341
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
It's not Elvis

342
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Elvis Presby

343
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
That's not it

344
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Who is it?

345
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Elvis Presby

346
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
That's not it

347
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
When you're on stage

348
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:58,000
What's the use of the flutters on the side of your costume?

349
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
That's a design

350
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
It's similar to this

351
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
It's similar

352
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
What was that?

353
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
The one you do this

354
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I don't know

355
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
The flutters start like this

356
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
If you don't have that

357
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
When you go like this

358
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
It comes like this

359
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Wait

360
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Do you want to drop it?

361
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Here?

362
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
That's right

363
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
That's how it is

364
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
If you don't have that

365
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
It comes like this

366
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
That's right

367
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
What about Presley?

368
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
What?

369
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
What about Presley?

370
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
When Presley sings

371
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
He does this

372
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I don't do that

373
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Today's guest is different

374
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Let's do this and go home

375
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:03,000
What is the black net you put on your shoulders when you dance?

376
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I don't think it has anything to do with the bow

377
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
What do you call it?

378
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
This kind of thing

379
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I have something on my shoulders

380
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Why did you start doing this?

381
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Wait

382
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Let's just say the meaning

383
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Do you know Kamen Rider V3?

384
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I do

385
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Double Typhoon

386
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
That's right

387
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Father, mother, and sister

388
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
All of your siblings were killed

389
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Blood is spilling from the shadows

390
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
They were killed

391
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Father, mother, and sister were killed

392
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
That's right

393
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
That's why you got angry

394
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
That's right

395
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Double Typhoon

396
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
That's right

397
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Do you understand?

398
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I understand

399
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
You understand, right?

400
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
You would be angry if your parents were killed

401
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
That's right

402
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
For example, if your parents were killed

403
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
You wouldn't be able to forgive them

404
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
That's right

405
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
You would be angry

406
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
That's right

407
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
That's why

408
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
If you say this, it's fine

409
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Do you understand?

410
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Isn't that the explanation of V3?

411
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Explain this

412
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Everyone in my age knows the explanation of V3

413
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
The reason why I started doing this

414
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Before I started doing this

415
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I was being teased

416
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
What are you talking about?

417
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Gaki no Tsukai comedy star has been born

418
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
A new star

419
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Yes

420
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Today

421
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Has been born

422
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Has been born

423
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I'm nervous

424
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I'm nervous

425
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I'm nervous

426
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I don't know how long I'll be able to keep up with everyone

427
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
The story has just started

428
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
It has just started

429
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Normally, I wouldn't be able to accept it

430
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
But I'm sure they'll do it

431
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I'm sure they'll do it

432
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I'm looking forward to it

433
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Let's continue

434
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Please take a look at this duo

435
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Thank you

436
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Yama-chan who disbanded Team Zero

437
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000

438

439
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
And a calculated sense of humor

440

441
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:21,000

442
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000

Hello, I'm Team One

00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Nice to meet you

445
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Nice to meet you

446
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I want money

447
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I want it too

448
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Do you want to play a game of Gingogo?

449
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Do you want to play?

450
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Yes, let's do it

451
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
You want to play?

452
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
You do it, I'll do it too

453
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
You're so cute

454
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
You're so cute

455
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
You're so cute

456
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Let's play Gingogo

457
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Let's play Gingogo

458
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
First, we need a tool

459
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
We need a tool

460
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
A knife

461
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
I don't have a knife

462
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
I do have one

463
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Why do you have one?

464
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
And two

465
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Why do you have two?

466
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Japanese television

467
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
You're so good

468
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
So good

469
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
So good

470
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
You're so talented

471
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Stop talking like that

472
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I'm not

473
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
You make me feel bad

474
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
You're right

475
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I have a knife, I have the weapon

476
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I have underwear

477
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Panties

478
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Panties

479
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Panties

480
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I'm embarrassed

481
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I do have one

482
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Why do you have one?

483
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I also have it

484
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Why do you have it?

485
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I have two

486
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Why do you have two?

487
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
I have two TVs

488
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
You don't have one

489
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
How about this?

490
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
You can't do it like this.

491
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Don't cover it up too much!

492
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Hurry up!

493
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I'm going to do it like this.

494
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
I'm going to do it like this.

495
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Wait a minute.

496
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I've never done it like this before.

497
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
It's my first time too!

498
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Teach me how to do it.

499
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
I'll go into the bank and say,

500
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Give me the money!

501
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Give me the money!

502
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
I'll practice.

503
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Give me the money!

504
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

505
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Give me the money!

506
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Give me the money!

507
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

508
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Give me the money!

509
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Okay!

510
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Give me the money!

511
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Okay!

512
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Give me the money!

513
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Okay!

514
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Give me the money!

515
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Don't get cocky!

516
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Don't get cocky!

517
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
I'm going to get caught!

518
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
What are you doing?

519
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I'm going to open two automatic toilets.

520
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Let's go!

521
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Ouch!

522
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
What are you doing?

523
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
I got caught in the automatic toilet.

524
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
What are you doing?

525
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Give me your hand!

526
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I won't give it to you!

527
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I'm going to the bank!

528
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
I'm going to the bank!

529
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
I'm going to do it again.

530
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Are you okay?

531
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Hey!

532
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I'm going to the bank!

533
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
I'm going to the bank!

534
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Give me the money!

535
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
I won't give it to you!

536
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Hey!

537
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Give me the money!

538
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I'm going to open two automatic toilets.

539
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I won't give it to you!

540
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
I won't give it to you!

541
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Look outside!

542
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Outside!

543
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Hey!

544
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
The police are here.

545
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Really?

546
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
If the police catch you,

547
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
You're going to jail, aren't you?

548
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I won't give it to you!

549
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Thank you very much.

550
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:04,000
You guys did your best!

551
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
You guys did your best!

552
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Your timing was bad!

553
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Wait a minute.

554
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
My timing was bad.

555
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Your timing was bad.

556
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Maybe it was you who pulled his leg.

557
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Do you want to do it again?

558
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Yes, I did my best.

559
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Thank you very much!
