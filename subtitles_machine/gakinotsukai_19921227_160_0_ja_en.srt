1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,680
Next time, we'll be at the Gaki no Tsukaya!

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:03,680
Let's watch Denpa Shounen too!

3
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:05,680
Next time, we'll be at the Gaki no Tsukaya!

4
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:08,680
Tiki-tiki Toshimatsuri Soccer Tournament!

5
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:17,680
Toshimatsuri Soccer Tournament!

6
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:18,680
That's right.

7
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:22,680
It says here that the blood is running, but...

8
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,680
I don't know what you're talking about.

9
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:27,680
I don't know what you're talking about.

10
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,680
Let's do our best today.

11
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:32,680
You have to use your physical strength from time to time.

12
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,680
You have to move your body.

13
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,680
The uniform is a little small.

14
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:39,680
Everyone's wearing a little tights today.

15
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,680
If you open it up a little, it'll look like this.

16
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:44,680
That's what it looks like.

17
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:47,680
That's what it looks like.

18
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,680
This is Ganba Matsumoto team.

19
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,680
Ganba Matsumoto team goes to these members.

20
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,680
This is the team I chose.

21
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:01,680
He used to play soccer.

22
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:02,680
Soccer?

23
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:03,680
Yes.

24
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:04,680
How long have you been playing soccer?

25
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,680
I've been playing soccer for about two years.

26
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,680
It's been two years.

27
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:09,680
It's been two years.

28
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,680
It's been two years.

29
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,680
It's a lie that it's been two years.

30
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:15,680
Here we are.

31
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,680
Hamada Perdy!

32
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,680
This is soccer.

33
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,680
Who played soccer?

34
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:29,680
It's like a crab.

35
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,680
I'm going to do the first round.

36
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:33,680
I'm going to do the first round.

37
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,680
I'm going to do the first round.

38
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,680
This is the judge.

39
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,680
Here you go.

40
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,680
It's a lie!

41
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:47,680
By the way, when did you first play soccer?

42
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,680
When I was in elementary school and high school.

43
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,680
I played soccer for about five years.

44
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,680
I'm going to play soccer for about five years.

45
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,680
I'm going to play soccer for about five years.

46
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,680
I'm going to play soccer for about five years.

47
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,680
This is Takakun!

48
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,680
This is Takakun!

49
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,680
Ganba Matsumoto!

50
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,680
This is a rock-paper-scissors game.

51
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,680
This is a rock-paper-scissors game.

52
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,680
This is a rock-paper-scissors game.

53
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,680
This is a rock-paper-scissors game.

54
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:35,680
There are a lot of people.

55
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,680
Get out of the way!

56
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,680
This is a rock-paper-scissors game.

57
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:43,680
This is a rock-paper-scissors game.

58
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,680
What are you doing?

59
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,680
This is a rock-paper-scissors game.

60
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,680
This is a rock-paper-scissors game.

61
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,680
I'm sorry.

62
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,680
I'm sorry.

63
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,680
I'm sorry.

64
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,680
I'm sorry.

65
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:09,680
I'm sorry.

66
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:11,020
OK.

67
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:19,560
I can do it.

68
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:28,160
I can't do it.

69
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,940
No. Don't go.

70
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,000
Come on.

71
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,040
Hey hey hey, I hit it!

72
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,600
It was visible, I hit it!

73
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:43,220
I'm not defending here.

74
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:46,600
When you turned to us, I wasattacking them as well!

75
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:48,260
', Spar!

76
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,860
Was it you?

77
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:50,360
Yes.

78
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,820
That guy overthere! I mean Udemyan!

79
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,980
That fool broke open!

80
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:58,560
You jinxed us!

81
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:00,340
You should blame him!

82
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,760
You passed the judge!

83
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:04,240
Why can't you blame the cheafer?

84
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:05,860
You should go to the police!

85
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:07,860
It's a real person.

86
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:09,860
Don't kick it.

87
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:19,860
I'll replace the guitar.

88
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:20,860
I'll replace the guitar.

89
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:21,860
I'll replace the guitar.

90
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:22,860
I'll replace the guitar.

91
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:25,860
I'll be back.

92
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:26,860
I'll be back.

93
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:29,860
The original song was completed before.

94
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:33,280
It's really

95
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,860
It's really light.

96
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:36,860
Cl noticeable

97
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:45,860
B G

98
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:46,860
B G

99
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:52,860
The original song was completed after.

100
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:54,860
Let's do it!

101
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,360
Throw it forward!

102
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,360
Throw it! Throw it! Throw it!

103
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,360
I can't do it!

104
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,360
I can't do it!

105
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:22,860
I can't do it!

106
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:31,860
Why didn't you throw it forward?

107
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:34,860
Throw it! Throw it!

108
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:36,860
Throw it!

109
00:05:36,860 --> 00:06:00,860
what do you think about last Aikido and it was ok?

110
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:01,860
Oh! it passed the record!

111
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,860
I can't give up now.

112
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:04,860
You can't give up?

113
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:06,860
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

114
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:09,860
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

115
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:22,860
Well, it's over for this year.

116
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:25,860
This is the last time this year.

117
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:26,860
It's the last time.

118
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:29,860
Of course, I'm not going to give up.

119
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:33,860
It's an unbelievable tandem.

120
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,860
When you wake up in the morning, you'll be like,

121
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:38,860
Ha!

122
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:41,860
My soul is burning.

123
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,860
It's already like this.

124
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:45,860
It's really a plasma.

125
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:46,860
It's amazing.

126
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:48,860
When you wake up in the morning, you'll definitely be like,

127
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:49,860
That tissue, nose,

128
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:55,860
They're already...

129
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:56,860
The source of evil.

130
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:58,860
The source of evil.

131
00:06:58,860 --> 00:06:59,860
It's already...

132
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:02,860
I'm going to do it with my hands like this.

133
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:04,860
I'm going to do it with my hands like this.

134
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:06,860
It's already like this.

135
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:11,860
If you do this, the room looks wide.

136
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:15,860
It's already a plasma.

137
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:17,860
It's become an amazing thing.

138
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:19,860
It's terrible.

139
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:21,860
You know, your nose is clogged.

140
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:23,860
I'm not feeling well when I sleep.

141
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,860
My nose is clogged.

142
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:28,860
That's why Hitoshi's breathing is like this.

143
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:30,860
I'm going to do it with my breath.

144
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:32,860
I'm going to do it with my mouth.

145
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:35,860
You have to use the monkey engine.

146
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:38,860
I'm not using a normal normal engine at all.

147
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:39,860
It's a second engine.

148
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:40,860
I'm going to do it with my mouth.

149
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,860
I can't use my nose at all.

150
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:43,860
When you wake up in the morning, you'll be like,

151
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:44,860
Ha!

152
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:46,860
My soul is burning.

153
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,860
It's already...

154
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:50,860
Hitoshi, you're crazy.

155
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:53,860
Hitoshi's pillow is clogged.

156
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:57,860
It's not clogged.

157
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:59,860
It's clogged.

158
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:00,860
It's terrible.

159
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:03,860
I've been on the bullet train for a week.

160
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:07,860
I can't get on the bullet train.

161
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:10,860
There's a lot of bad gas.

162
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:14,860
There was a funny guy on the bullet train.

163
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:16,860
He's been on the bullet train for a long time.

164
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:18,860
He's been on the bullet train for a long time.

165
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:21,860
He fell right in front of my seat.

166
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:23,860
I can't help but talk.

167
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:24,860
I'm very excited.

168
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:27,860
And there's no one to talk to.

169
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:32,860
I'm going to be on the train.

170
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,860
I'm going to be on the train.

171
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:38,860
Thank you for your time today.

172
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:39,860
Yes, yes.

173
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:44,860
This is it.

174
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:47,860
I can't help it.

175
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:48,860
But I'm going to laugh.

176
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:51,860
It's funny.

177
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:57,860
These days, fake coupons are coming out.

178
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:00,860
It's hard for me.

179
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:03,860
I'm screaming.

180
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:05,860
If you're that drunk, you'll feel good.

181
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:08,860
I don't have that experience.

182
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:11,860
I can't drink that much.

183
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:13,860
There was a party the other day.

184
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:18,860
I was drunk.

185
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:20,860
I don't know what to say.

186
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:24,860
It's funny no matter what you say.

187
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:26,860
What's that?

188
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:28,860
What's that?

189
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,860
What's that?

190
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:33,860
Yes, yes.

191
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:36,860
I can't help it.

192
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:39,860
I can't help it.

193
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:41,860
It's funny.

194
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:44,860
When I was in junior high school,

195
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:48,860
I was watching TV all the time.

196
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:51,860
It was a wallet.

197
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:54,860
The word wallet is funny.

198
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:57,860
I was laughing until the morning.

199
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:01,860
But it's a wallet.

200
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,860
There's that.

201
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:05,860
I don't know why.

202
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:12,860
I was hit by a temple.

203
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:14,860
It's dangerous.

204
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:17,860
I was hit hard.

205
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:20,860
I felt good.

206
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:22,860
I was waiting for a step.

207
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:24,860
I was waiting for a step.

208
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:27,860
I was waiting for a step.

209
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:29,860
I was waiting for a step.

210
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:32,860
Don't cry.

211
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:36,860
I didn't want to say it.

212
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:40,860
But I was so excited.

213
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:43,860
I couldn't help it.

214
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:45,860
Don't say that to me.

215
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:47,860
I'm a victim.

216
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:50,860
I'm the one who made me feel bad.

217
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:53,860
Don't say that.

218
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:56,860
I can't help it.

219
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:59,860
I can't help it.

220
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:02,860
That's why I'm a victim.

221
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:05,860
I can't help it.

222
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:08,860
I'm talking to you.

223
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:11,860
Don't you understand?

224
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:17,860
I think it's a strange move.

225
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:19,860
I'm listening.

226
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:21,860
I can't help it.

227
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:24,860
What should I do next year?

228
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:25,860
What?

229
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:27,860
It's a job.

230
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:30,860
I want to know how you're going to do it.

231
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:34,860
What are you going to do in April?

232
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,860
I'm going to quit in April.

233
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:45,860
That's what I'm saying.

234
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:51,860
I've never seen a show like that.

235
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:54,860
What's going on?

236
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:04,860
That's not it.

237
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:07,860
I'm going to think about it.

238
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:10,860
I think like that.

239
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:13,860
I'm thinking about it.

240
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:16,860
I'm thinking about it.

241
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:17,860
Are you going to make it?

242
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:18,860
I see.

243
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:21,860
If you think you've done as much as you can,

244
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:22,860
I refuse to come anymore.

245
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:24,860
I refuse to come anymore.

246
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:25,860
Let's go.

247
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:27,860
That would be nice.

248
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:29,860
That's what I'm saying.

249
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:31,860
What about around here?

250
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:34,860
That's why you shouldn't squeeze it.

251
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:36,860
I don't think it's necessary.

252
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:37,860
I'm going to shape it up.

253
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:38,860
I'm going to shape it up.

254
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:40,860
We're a little drunk right now.

255
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:41,860
We're drunk.

256
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:42,860
We're drunk.

257
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:46,860
First of all, let's start with West Pride.

258
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:48,860
What's in West Pride?

259
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:52,860
What's in West Pride?

260
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:53,860
West Pride?

261
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:55,860
We don't do that kind of show.

262
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:57,860
We're not doing it.

263
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,860
We don't have downtown.

264
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:01,860
We don't have a bar.

265
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:02,860
We don't have a bar.

266
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:04,860
It's a little different.

267
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:07,860
We have a show like that.

268
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:08,860
We have a show like that.

269
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:09,860
It's kind of like this.

270
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:10,860
It's kind of like this.

271
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:14,860
It's kind of like this.

272
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:16,860
It's on both shoulders.

273
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:18,860
It's like this.

274
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:20,860
But it's kind of like this.

275
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:21,860
It's kind of like this.

276
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:22,860
It's kind of like this.

277
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:26,860
It's kind of like this.

278
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:27,860
I see.

279
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:29,860
What's this?

280
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:31,860
What's this?

281
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:33,860
I'm a little...

282
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:39,860
Here.

283
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:41,860
I just went with the flow.

284
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:43,860
I went with the flow.

285
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:45,860
I thought everything was fine.

286
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:46,860
It's like this.

287
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:48,860
It's like this.

288
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:55,860
It's like this.

289
00:13:55,860 --> 00:14:00,860
It's like this.

290
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:02,860
I'm not going to save it.

291
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:03,860
I see.

292
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:04,860
There are various things.

293
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:05,860
There are various things.

294
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:07,860
But you can squeeze in a little more work.

295
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:09,860
I go out too much on New Year's Day.

296
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:15,860
I don't have time to go out on New Year's Day. It's almost morning.

297
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:17,860
And two days later...

298
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:19,860
Ah, two days later...

299
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:21,860
Downtown...

300
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:24,860
Downtown's Happy New...

301
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:26,860
Nyan Bakan!

302
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:28,860
Are you deaf?

303
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:32,860
Downtown's Happy New Nyan Bakan!

304
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:33,860
It's two days in January.

305
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:35,860
It's from 9 o'clock in the evening.

306
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:37,860
It's two hours.

307
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:39,860
And next to me...

308
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:40,860
The TV host said,

309
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:42,860
Did you watch Kaseifu?

310
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:45,860
I was doing a two-hour drama.

311
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:47,860
And next to me, the TV host said...

312
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:49,860
What was it?

313
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:51,860
The special edition of NARUHODO.

314
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:54,860
This is Nyan Bakan, after all.

315
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:56,860
It's the special edition of NARUHODO.

316
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:00,860
If I'm home, I'll watch Kaseifu.

317
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:03,860
Are you kidding me?

318
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:04,860
No, no, no.

319
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:05,860
That's a little...

320
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:06,860
No, it's just...

321
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:09,860
My Nyan Bakan has an eye.

322
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:14,860
Oh, really?

323
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:15,860
Hey!

324
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:17,860
Everyone watching the TV!

325
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:18,860
What?

326
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:20,860
Don't you want to see Machi's brother?

327
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:28,860
If you watch Nyan Bakan, you can see the two-shot of the Matsumoto brothers!

328
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:33,860
If you don't say it, I'll never understand Nyan Bakan.

329
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:34,860
No, it's not like that.

330
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:35,860
Why not?

331
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:37,860
There are about 180 of them.

332
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:41,860
This is the 182nd, right?

333
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:44,860
Right?

334
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,860
And you know, the two of you...

335
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:49,860
My brother came, and my brother's wife came.

336
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:51,860
And the two children came.

337
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:53,860
Two years old and one...

338
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:54,860
Three years old.

339
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:58,860
I'm here, so I'll talk to you when I'm done today.

340
00:15:58,860 --> 00:15:59,860
When I got home earlier.

341
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:03,860
Two years old, you... You're not old yet, are you?

342
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:09,860
What?

343
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:15,860
I recently did a flying box in a physical education class.

344
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:16,860
Yeah.

345
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:17,860
I was angry.

346
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:18,860
Why?

347
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:20,860
Why do you have to fly something like that?

348
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:22,860
What's the use of it in the future?

349
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:24,860
It's not necessary.

350
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:26,860
That's not it.

351
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:29,860
If I say it's not necessary, that's not it.

352
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:31,860
I don't know. I don't know.

353
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:33,860
It's my role.

354
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:34,860
Why?

355
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:40,860
There are things in general life that are good to do a lot of flying boxes.

356
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:43,860
I'm just going to live my life and run like that.

357
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:47,860
There's nothing to do like this.

358
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:49,860
There's nothing to do like this.

359
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:51,860
I'll check it out.

360
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:52,860
There's no such thing.

361
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:53,860
There's no such thing.

362
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:55,860
Wait.

363
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:56,860
No, no, no, no.

364
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:59,860
I'm going to jump over here.

365
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:00,860
Exactly.

366
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:02,860
What are you talking about?

367
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:04,860
You did it for the first time today.

368
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:06,860
I only did it once so far.

369
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:08,860
That's exactly what it is.

370
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:09,860
It's exactly what it is.

371
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:12,860
I've been talking about it all this time.

372
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:14,860
Do it about once.

373
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:15,860
I thought I was going to say something like this.

374
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:16,860
No, no, no, no.

375
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:17,860
That's what I'm saying.

376
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:18,860
I can't use it.

377
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:22,860
You often say, do you need a mathematical equation or a number equation?

378
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:24,860
I think it's necessary.

379
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:25,860
What do you mean?

380
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:26,860
That's what I'm trying to say.

381
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:28,860
What I often say is...

382
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:30,860
You do the counting, right?

383
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:32,860
You're doing something you shouldn't do, right?

384
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:34,860
I think I'm doing more and more counting.

385
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:36,860
So, then...

386
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:38,860
Doing the counting is...

387
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:40,860
It's exciting.

388
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:42,860
There's a sense of tension.

389
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:45,860
I'm going to steal someone's eye.

390
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:47,860
For example, what is it?

391
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:49,860
The price of the price.

392
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:50,860
I don't know this.

393
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:52,860
I'm going to steal it when I don't know.

394
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:54,860
And then I'll take a look at that person.

395
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:57,860
I'll never forget what I saw.

396
00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:00,860
That's why it's called counting.

397
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:02,860
So, this counting...

398
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:04,860
It might be bad, but...

399
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:05,860
I'm going to remember this.

400
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:06,860
I tried to memorize it.

401
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:07,860
I tried to memorize it.

402
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:09,860
It's hard to remember, but...

403
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:11,860
I can't remember, but...

404
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:12,860
I stole the teacher's eye.

405
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:15,860
I don't forget what I saw.

406
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:17,860
That's why I'm going to steal the price of the price.

407
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:19,860
I'll steal it when I'm in middle school.

408
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:23,860
But that's a bad thing for me.

409
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:25,860
But there's one problem.

410
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:29,860
I can't remember the price of the price.

411
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:32,860
I don't think this is going to work.

412
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:33,860
What you're saying is...

413
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:35,860
I don't think it's going to work.

414
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:38,860
Counting...

415
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:41,860
If you can remember it by counting.

416
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:44,860
I don't think that's a bad thing.

417
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:45,860
Oh, I see.

418
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:47,860
That's right.

419
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:50,860
When you're in middle school or high school,

420
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:52,860
Don't you want to come to school?

421
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:54,860
You're the only one who gave me a score.

422
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:56,860
You don't have to show me anything.

423
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:57,860
Don't take it.

424
00:18:57,860 --> 00:19:00,860
I hit you once during the exam.

425
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:02,860
No, no, no.

426
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:04,860
I was thinking like this.

427
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:06,860
I don't want to see it.

428
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:08,860
I don't want to see it, but...

429
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:10,860
If you do it like this,

430
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:11,860
The guy next to you...

431
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:13,860
I hid it.

432
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:15,860
I hit you during the exam.

433
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:18,860
I'm a fool.

434
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:21,860
Why don't you guys understand?

435
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:24,860
I hit you during the exam.

436
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:26,860
I hit you.

437
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:28,860
I'm a fool.

438
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:30,860
I don't want to see it.

439
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:32,860
I'm a fool.

440
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:34,860
I don't want to see it.

441
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:36,860
I don't want to see it.

442
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:37,860
I have a question for you.

443
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:42,860
There's a great catchphrase called the Lion of the Hundred Beasts.

444
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:45,860
Other animals don't have a great catchphrase.

445
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:46,860
How do you do it?

446
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:47,860
I'll tell you.

447
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:48,860
Oh, that's right.

448
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:50,860
Isn't the lion the only one who does that?

449
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:52,860
That's right.

450
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:54,860
This is discrimination.

451
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:55,860
Discrimination.

452
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:56,860
This is discrimination.

453
00:19:56,860 --> 00:20:01,860
I don't think the lion is called the Lion of the Hundred Beasts.

454
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:02,860
I'm angry about that.

455
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:04,860
Do you think so?

456
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:05,860
I think so.

457
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:07,860
It's in the attitude.

458
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:09,860
If you make that face,

459
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:10,860
It's going to be that attitude.

460
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:15,860
If you do that, you're going to get nothing.

461
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:16,860
Don't worry.

462
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:17,860
Don't worry.

463
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:20,860
I'll put the lion's head on it.

464
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:23,860
It's big, isn't it?

465
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:26,860
That's right.

466
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:28,860
Just like that.

467
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:31,860
Then you're the Lion of the Hundred Beasts.

468
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:33,860
I don't know where the lion is.

469
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:35,860
I'm the lion of the hundred beasts.

470
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:37,860
I don't know where the lion is.

471
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:38,860
The nose is long.

472
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:39,860
The nose is long.

473
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:41,860
It's hard to tell.

474
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:43,860
No, it's the same thing. It's big, it's long.

475
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:46,860
It's like I'm the story of this guy.

476
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:47,860
Right?

477
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:49,860
It's the lion in the story.

478
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:50,860
Yeah.

479
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:51,860
It's big, right?

480
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:52,860
That's right.

481
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:55,860
That's why I say it's long.

482
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:56,860
That's how I say it.

483
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:58,860
Neck.

484
00:20:58,860 --> 00:20:59,860
It's long.

485
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:00,860
It's like a giraffe.

486
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:02,860
There's only a neck.

487
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:03,860
That's not true.

488
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:04,860
The tail is long.

489
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:05,860
The legs are long, too.

490
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:07,860
There's only a long neck.

491
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:09,860
Why do you have to say that?

492
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:11,860
That's not true.

493
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:13,860
If you say it's big, there's only an elephant.

494
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:14,860
It's big.

495
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:15,860
It's an elephant.

496
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:17,860
It's a catchphrase.

497
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:18,860
Yeah.

498
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:19,860
It's an elephant.

499
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:20,860
That's what I'm saying.

500
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:21,860
It's an elephant.

501
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:22,860
The elephant is over.

502
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:26,860
You can't just look at it and say it.

503
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:29,860
That's why you can't just look at it and say it.

504
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:31,860
There's only one way to do it.

505
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:32,860
I see.

506
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:33,860
For example,

507
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:36,860
a bongoose.

508
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:38,860
What's a bongoose?

509
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:39,860
What's a bongoose?

510
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:41,860
Hey!

511
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:42,860
Huh?

512
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:44,860
What's a bongoose?

513
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:48,860
Oh, the one that looks like a snake?

514
00:21:48,860 --> 00:22:07,860
The one that looks like a snake?
