1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,400
It's going to rain now!

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:06,600
My sister is coming back from the hospital.

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:09,140
He's excited to play games with the cats.

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:16,020
It's big enough to play music.

5
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,740
You're cute.

6
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:26,920
Mom?

7
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:29,240
He's excited to see my mom.

8
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:32,060
Nevertheless, we managed to get in.

9
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:34,060
Happy New Year right?

10
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,500
Ah?!

11
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,500
You are보리 gamma

12
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,500
I don't know what you're talking about.

13
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,500
You're crazy.

14
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:11,500
I'm sorry.

15
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,500
You're late.

16
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:14,500
I'm sorry.

17
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:17,500
I'm sorry.

18
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:21,500
I'm sorry.

19
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,500
Good morning.

20
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,500
Good morning.

21
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:41,500
Good morning.

22
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:52,500
Hello.

23
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,500
Hello.

24
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:58,500
I'm the guide, Akimi Nagayama.

25
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:01,500
Nice to meet you.

26
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:08,500
Is there anything you don't know?

27
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,500
I don't know.

28
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,500
What's your name?

29
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,500
I'll tell you.

30
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,500
I'm Akimi Nagayama.

31
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,500
You're angry, aren't you?

32
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:23,500
I'm back.

33
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,500
How was it?

34
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,500
We're going to have a picnic.

35
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:35,500
I think you all know about the picnic.

36
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:38,500
I'd like to sing a song.

37
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,500
One, two, three.

38
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:45,500
Let's go over the hill.

39
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:48,500
Let's blow into the earth.

40
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:49,500
Why are you all so shy?

41
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,500
Let's sing together.

42
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:53,500
Let's pierce the blue sky.

43
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:57,500
Let's pierce the blue sky.

44
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:01,500
Let's sing together.

45
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:05,500
Let's go over the hill.

46
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:09,500
Let's pierce the blue sky.

47
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:13,500
Let's pierce the blue sky.

48
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:17,500
Let's go over the hill.

49
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:22,500
Let's pierce the blue sky.

50
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:29,500
Put sunglasses on and melt the water.

51
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:33,500
When you put it on, it changes.

52
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,500
What?

53
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,500
I'm sorry.

54
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,500
It doesn't change anything.

55
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:42,500
I don't think it's funny, so I'll take a picture of it.

56
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,500
Let's all take a picture.

57
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,500
Let's start with Yamazaki.

58
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:16,500
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.

59
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,500
Are we two?

60
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,500
What?

61
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,500
What about Shoji?

62
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:24,500
Who's Shoji?

63
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:28,500
Everyone, let's go.

64
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,500
I hope you don't get in the way.

65
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,500
Sakamoto-kun.

66
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,500
Yes.

67
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,500
You're not in the picture.

68
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,500
You're not in the picture.

69
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:41,500
You're not in the picture yet.

70
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:45,500
Everyone, let's go to the left.

71
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:52,500
I'm not going to lose.

72
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,500
Wait, I'm going to win.

73
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:30,500
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.

74
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,500
Try it.

75
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:35,500
I don't think it's funny.

76
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:38,500
Let's all have lunch.

77
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:41,500
Yeah.

78
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:46,500
Let's eat.

79
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:50,500
Everyone made lunch by their own strength.

80
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:55,500
To be honest, I've been wondering about the side dishes since a week ago.

81
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:59,500
First of all, this.

82
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:02,500
Who the hell is this?

83
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:05,500
It's hard.

84
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:11,500
What's on it?

85
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,500
This.

86
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:17,500
Put it on.

87
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:20,500
Who is this?

88
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:27,500
All right.

89
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,500
What is this?

90
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:32,500
Producer.

91
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,500
It's perfect.

92
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,500
I don't know this either.

93
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,500
Takasu?

94
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,500
Takasu?

95
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,500
Wow.

96
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,500
It's amazing.

97
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:47,500
Look at this.

98
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:51,500
If you take this money, it'll be 1,500 yen.

99
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:55,500
This is about 450 yen.

100
00:06:55,500 --> 00:07:00,500
Wow.

101
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,500
It's hard.

102
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:05,500
I'm getting old.

103
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:12,500
What's this?

104
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,500
Is this a punch?

105
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,500
This is a punch.

106
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,500
This is a man's dish.

107
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,500
This is a punch.

108
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,500
Who is this?

109
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:22,500
All right.

110
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,500
What's on it?

111
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,500
Wow.

112
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:31,500
This.

113
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,500
What is this?

114
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,500
Is this a crab?

115
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:39,500
I don't know this.

116
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,500
What is this?

117
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:46,500
I put it in the freezer.

118
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,500
You're not good at this.

119
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:51,500
What is this?

120
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:55,500
This is a lunch box.

121
00:07:55,500 --> 00:08:00,500
I'm sorry.

122
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:08,500
Hey.

123
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:16,500
You're a fool.

124
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,500
This is no good.

125
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:21,500
I ordered a lunch box.

126
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,500
This is how it was made.

127
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,500
There's no food coloring.

128
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:35,500
There's no food coloring.

129
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,500
This is a crab.

130
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,500
This is an Anpan.

131
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,500
This is delicious.

132
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,500
I'm scared.

133
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,500
Look at this egg.

134
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:45,500
This is wonderful.

135
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,500
I'm going to eat it.

136
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,500
You're eating it, aren't you?

137
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,500
Eat it.

138
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,500
Eat it.

139
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,500
It's okay.

140
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,500
What is this?

141
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,500
You'll know when you eat it.

142
00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:00,500
It's a spinach.

143
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:03,500
There's no taste at all.

144
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,500
What is this?

145
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,500
I forgot to season it.

146
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:12,500
Yamazaki, eat all the spinach.

147
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,500
The source of energy.

148
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,500
You have to feed me that.

149
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:23,500
I'm going to eat it all.

150
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:29,500
You're a fool.

151
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,500
What is this?

152
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,500
There's no taste at all.

153
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:53,500
It's bitter.

154
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:57,500
I don't think there are many customers today.

155
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,500
Why is that?

156
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:02,500
I'm tired and I can't talk.

157
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:05,500
I don't know because you didn't watch the opening.

158
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:09,500
We were planning to make lunch by ourselves.

159
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,500
We went on a picnic.

160
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,500
We went on a picnic.

161
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:15,500
We always think about what to do next week.

162
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,500
Let's make lunch.

163
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,500
Let's do our best.

164
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:26,500
I've been thinking about it for a week.

165
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,500
I want you to see that.

166
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,500
There was spinach.

167
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,500
What's this?

168
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:35,500
This is spinach.

169
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,500
That's right.

170
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:40,500
That's bad.

171
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:45,500
You won't understand it.

172
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,500
He's really good at it.

173
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,500
He's good at it.

174
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:48,500
He's really good at it.

175
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:51,500
In fact, I hated him when I first saw him.

176
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,500
I hated him when I first saw him.

177
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,500
I hated him when I first saw him.

178
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:58,500
But it's interesting.

179
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,000
No, no, no, no.

180
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,500
I don't care about that.

181
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:04,000
I'm talking about the taste of your Horanso.

182
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,500
You should season it.

183
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,500
That's what everyone says at first.

184
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,000
But as you eat it, you'll understand its taste.

185
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,500
When you eat natto at first, everyone is surprised.

186
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,500
At the current stage,

187
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,500
you should season it like this.

188
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,500
It's already done.

189
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:21,500
You should do it and add it.

190
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,500
Don't be afraid to be told off.

191
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:26,500
Why should I be told off so much?

192
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:29,000
It's bad, so I'll take it off.

193
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,500
That's why I'm apologizing.

194
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:36,500
That attitude is the attitude of apologizing.

195
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,500
Don't hit me anymore.

196
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:40,500
I'm not saying that.

197
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,500
This is a man.

198
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:44,500
The staff said,

199
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:47,500
I want you to have a match little by little.

200
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,500
Can I decide this time?

201
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,000
What are you talking about?

202
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,500
You decide every time.

203
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:57,500
If you lose to a person, it's a punishment game.

204
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,500
I can't move by myself.

205
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,500
If you lose to yourself, I can do it, too.

206
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,500
I didn't lose.

207
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:04,500
I just lost.

208
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,500
That's right.

209
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,500
White wins.

210
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,500
Don't say that.

211
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,500
That's it.

212
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,500
Just temporarily.

213
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,500
That's where I am.

214
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,500
You're next to me.

215
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:18,500
I chose...

216
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:21,500
Takatobi.

217
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,500
You've been saying that for a long time.

218
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:26,500
It's amazing.

219
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,500
To tell you the truth,

220
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:31,500
I didn't want to play Takatobi.

221
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,500
If you play it, you'll win.

222
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,500
That's right.

223
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:37,500
It's dirty.

224
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,500
I've thought about it many times.

225
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,500
I'm good at it.

226
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,500
It's a game.

227
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,500
It's already decided.

228
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,500
It's already decided.

229
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,500
I didn't want to play it if I could.

230
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:46,500
But I won't come.

231
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,500
If I'm red-handed.

232
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,500
What do you say?

233
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,500
What am I to the public?

234
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,500
What am I?

235
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,500
You don't know?

236
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,500
I don't know.

237
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,500
What are you going to do?

238
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,500
What are you going to do?

239
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:58,500
What are you going to say?

240
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,500
Where are you coming from?

241
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,500
But if it's Takatobi,

242
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:02,500
I can win.

243
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,500
Right?

244
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,500
I can't play sports in the public.

245
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:06,500
Right?

246
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,500
I'm not good at cooking.

247
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,500
I know this today.

248
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,500
Right?

249
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,500
I'm too weak for women.

250
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:16,500
No one says that.

251
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,500
I don't earn more than Hamada.

252
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,500
I only earn 110,000 yen.

253
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,500
What kind of man are you?

254
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,500
I'm often told that.

255
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,500
Liar!

256
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,500
I'm often told that.

257
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,500
Anyway,

258
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,500
today,

259
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,500
or rather, this time,

260
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,500
Did you play the last one?

261
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,500
If I play this,

262
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,500
I'll be...

263
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:33,500
But if you play that,

264
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,500
I'll do my best.

265
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:35,500
If you're so good at it,

266
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,500
I won't refuse.

267
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,500
Really?

268
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,500
Yes.

269
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,500
You really won't play Takatobi with me?

270
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,500
Yes.

271
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:43,500
Well,

272
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:46,500
It's a great honor to play Takatobi with me.

273
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:51,500
Only Akira Nishikino can play Takatobi with me in the entertainment world.

274
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,500
Do you want to play Takatobi with me?

275
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,500
If you refuse,

276
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,500
I'll be scolded again.

277
00:13:56,500 --> 00:14:01,500
What kind of memory do you have?

278
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:04,500
What's the average?

279
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,500
About 140,000 yen.

280
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,500
You can fly with 140,000 yen.

281
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,500
I can fly with 140,000 yen.

282
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,500
I can fly with more than 140,000 yen.

283
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,500
What?

284
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:16,500
Can you fly with more than 140,000 yen?

285
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:19,500
Why are you so scared?

286
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:22,500
I can't help it.

287
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,500
What's the average?

288
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,500
100,000 yen?

289
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,500
I don't know.

290
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,500
For example,

291
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:31,500
how many times have you flown with your memory?

292
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:37,500
Hurry up and say it.

293
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,500
Well,

294
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:41,500
If you talk to me, I'll fly with you.

295
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,500
It's 145,000 yen.

296
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,500
That's not true.

297
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,500
You can fly with more than 145,000 yen.

298
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,500
I can't fly with more than 145,000 yen.

299
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,500
Well,

300
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:51,500
I can't fly with more than 140,000 yen.

301
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,500
Let's say it's high.

302
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,500
How much can you fly with?

303
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,500
Let me tell you.

304
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,500
When I was in the second year of junior high school,

305
00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:01,500
I flew with 165,000 yen without lying.

306
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:05,500
Moreover, I flew with Rappa Zubon.

307
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:08,500
What kind of time was that?

308
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:11,500
You flew with Rappa Zubon.

309
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,500
So,

310
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:16,500
I don't know if I'll win or lose this time.

311
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,500
Next time,

312
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,500
I'll do it.

313
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,500
I can't do that.

314
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:21,500
Why?

315
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:24,500
I agree with you.

316
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,500
I'm the leader.

317
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,500
Who is the leader?

318
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,500
I'm the captain.

319
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,500
I've been pulling you all the time.

320
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,500
I'm the captain, too.

321
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,500
So, let's decide the punishment game.

322
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,500
Okay.

323
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,500
I know what you're going to do.

324
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:39,500
Okay.

325
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,500
You're dirty.

326
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,500
You're dirty because of your double structure.

327
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,500
Why?

328
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,500
If you fall from a dirty place,

329
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,500
there's still something dirty.

330
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:48,500
Even if you fall down,

331
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:49,500
there's still something dirty.

332
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,500
Why?

333
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,500
When I play a punishment game,

334
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,500
I'm not cool,

335
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,500
but when you play a punishment game,

336
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:56,500
you're so manly.

337
00:15:56,500 --> 00:16:00,500
You should try skydiving.

338
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,500
What?

339
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,500
I've only done it once.

340
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:05,500
I was crying.

341
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,500
You're just a pigeon

342
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:10,500
and you're just sitting here.

343
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,500
A long time ago,

344
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,500
there was a crowbar.

345
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,500
That's all.

346
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,500
You can say anything about me.

347
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,500
But you can't say anything about a crowbar.

348
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,500
Why?

349
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:27,500
What's the meaning of a crowbar?

350
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,500
What is it?

351
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:32,500
You have a dirty crowbar.

352
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,500
No, it's not dirty.

353
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,500
I haven't used it for 30 years.

354
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,500
Why don't you take this and use it here?

355
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:40,500
Why?

356
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,500
That's a punishment game.

357
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,500
Give me a break.

358
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:46,500
Why?

359
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,500
I'm hesitating to take it,

360
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,500
but I have to use it here?

361
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:52,500
I look like a man who gets angry easily.

362
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:53,500
If you lose,

363
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,500
I'll take this,

364
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,500
so I'll use it somewhere.

365
00:16:55,500 --> 00:17:01,500
Why do I have to use your crowbar?

366
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,500
Take the skin here.

367
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,500
Why?

368
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,500
Don't take it.

369
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:09,500
Then I'll cry.

370
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:12,500
I'll use your crowbar.

371
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:15,500
Here?

372
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:18,500
Use my crowbar here.

373
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:26,500
I'll use it when I'm angry.

374
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,500
But you want to use my crowbar, don't you?

375
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,500
I don't want to use it.

376
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:34,500
Have you ever been saved by this?

377
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:37,500
Don't say such a thing.

378
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,500
If I were you,

379
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:42,500
I'd use your crowbar here.

380
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:46,500
I'll use the round crowbar here.

381
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:54,500
I'll use the round crowbar here to eat you.

382
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,500
Do you have a magazine cover?

383
00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:02,500
In your family?

384
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,500
I don't want to.

385
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,500
On TV?

386
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:11,500
With a lemon in your family?

387
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,500
I don't want to.

388
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,500
Why?

389
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,500
You don't have to have a lemon.

390
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,500
I don't want to.

391
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,500
I don't want to have a lemon.

392
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:22,500
I don't want to have everything.

393
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,500
If you say so,

394
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:26,500
I'll make you happy.

395
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:27,500
Is this show over?

396
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,500
Not yet.

397
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,500
After this show,

398
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,500
on June 10th,

399
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,500
Thursday at 7.30 p.m.

400
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:37,500
I'll be on the show on the 10th.

401
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,500
Please watch it.

402
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:44,500
Let's go to the newspaper.

403
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,500
I have a question.

404
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,500
When you close your eyes,

405
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:51,500
what is the meaning of the pattern on the back of your eyes?

406
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,500
Can you see the pattern?

407
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,500
Yes, I can.

408
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,500
See?

409
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:56,500
I can see it.

410
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:59,500
I can see the light.

411
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:02,500
For example, this girl can see this.

412
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,500
This girl can see it.

413
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:11,500
No way.

414
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,500
I can see it perfectly.

415
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:16,500
No way.

416
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:19,500
I can see the pattern.

417
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,500
What kind of pattern can you see?

418
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,500
I can see the letters.

419
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,500
What does it say?

420
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,500
What does it say?

421
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:33,500
I started to eat cold noodles.

422
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:38,500
Why does a cook wear a long hat?

423
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,500
Why?

424
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:43,500
It doesn't make any sense to work.

425
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:47,500
It depends on what kind of food the person is eating.

426
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:51,500
A great person wears a long hat.

427
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,500
That's right.

428
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,500
That's a mistake.

429
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:57,500
The highest you can see is a normal person.

430
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,500
What?

431
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,500
You can see the highest.

432
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,500
The person wearing a long hat is the greatest.

433
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,500
The person wearing a long hat is the greatest.

434
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:07,500
The person wearing a long hat is the greatest.

435
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:10,500
He is a fool.

436
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,500
No, he is not a fool.

437
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,500
He is not a person.

438
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:18,500
There is a person who is very tall behind him.

439
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,500
He doesn't go out of the restaurant.

440
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,500
He says it's not true.

441
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,500
He doesn't go out of the restaurant.

442
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,500
He cannot go out.

443
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,500
There are many people who are tall.

444
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,500
He doesn't need a hat.

445
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,500
He can't work.

446
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:35,500
He doesn't move.

447
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:39,100
So, wait a minute, Matsumoto, are you going to run away like that?

448
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:41,580
There are people who say that, right?

449
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:44,860
But that doesn't make sense why it's expensive.

450
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:48,820
I understand why it's expensive, but I don't know why it's expensive.

451
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:53,420
There's a lot of umami in it.

452
00:20:53,420 --> 00:21:03,420
I'm just fooling around and being mocked by my partner.

453
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:09,420
Umami?

454
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:13,420
What do you mean? Tell me in detail, Mammo-san.

455
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:15,420
What are you talking about?

456
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:17,420
I'm talking about the umami.

457
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:19,420
Don't you understand?

458
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:21,420
Tell me.

459
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:23,420
I don't understand.

460
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:25,420
What do you mean?

461
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:27,420
There's umami in the hat.

462
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:29,420
I don't understand.

463
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:35,420
There's no reason why it's so long.

464
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:37,420
You're really eating me up.

465
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:39,420
It's okay to be horizontal, right?

466
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:41,420
Why didn't you make it vertical?

467
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:43,420
That's why I'm jealous.

468
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:45,420
For example, stir-fry vegetables.

469
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:47,420
I'm going to do it.

470
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:49,420
I'm going to do it.

471
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:51,420
There's no umami in it.

472
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:55,420
There's a lot of umami in it.

473
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:57,420
It's expensive.

474
00:21:57,420 --> 00:22:21,420
There's a hole in it.
