1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Chiki-chiki! Shiku! Machan! The plan has fallen down!

2
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:09,000
So, the plan has fallen down.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:09,500
I'm sorry.

4
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,000
Let's go!

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Right?

6
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:15,500
Sorry.

7
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,000
Before this time,

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,500
I used to play downtown in the middle of the night.

9
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,000
In the middle of that,

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,500
there were a lot of clashes.

11
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:35,000
I was like this.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,500
No, I was like this.

13
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,500
There were a lot of things like that.

14
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,000
In the middle of that,

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,500
for example,

16
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,000
in the first round,

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
the Kouhaku-Utakashi match.

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Who will win?

19
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
It's not a bet.

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
The one who loses in this,

21
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
in the first round,

22
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,500
the VTR that you're about to see,

23
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,000
is Zoom-in Asa.

24
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm going to appear live in this.

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm just going to appear a little behind.

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
It's a refreshing morning.

27
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
It's the best.

28
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Zoom-in Asa

29
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Hello.

30
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Yes.

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I'm going now.

32
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:31,500
Yes.

33
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,000
Stay on TV.

34
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:33,500
Yes.

35
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:36,000
Watch my way of life.

36
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Zoom-in Asa

37
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I'm still on the phone with Hamada.

38
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Yes.

39
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I'm really on the phone.

40
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Hello.

41
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Yes.

42
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I'm going now.

43
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Yes.

44
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'm going to appear live in this.

45
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Stay on TV.

46
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I'm still on the phone with Hamada.

47
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I'm really on the phone.

48
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Good morning.

49
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
It's Wednesday, January 17th.

50
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
First of all, Asa Ichiban is going to Shizuoka.

51
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Zoom-in Asa

52
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
By the way,

53
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
we started at 5 o'clock this morning.

54
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
There are 146 tickets.

55
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
And 154 people were injured.

56
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
It seems that a strange person has been coming from the morning.

57
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
It is said that you will be able to fly to Heijo by wrapping a freezing material around the runway.

58
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
It seems that Hamada will also go well.

59
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I think I can fly today.

60
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:53,000
However, if you go into the shade, it will slip, so I would like everyone to be careful.

61
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Then, towards your smile this morning,

62
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Zoom-in

63
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Next, I played baseball.

64
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Matsumoto said that I was good at baseball.

65
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Then, the team called Down's Town was divided.

66
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Let's play a game.

67
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
The person who lost this time is Kanchu Suie.

68
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
As you can see, I'm dressed up.

69
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I was given only what I won.

70
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
It was so warm.

71
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
However, such brave men came in this cold.

72
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Look over there.

73
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
They are still stupid.

74
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Look at that rough wave.

75
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
From now on, you are heading towards that rough wave.

76
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Do you understand?

77
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Yes.

78
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Do you understand?

79
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Yes.

80
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
It doesn't matter if it's cold.

81
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Yes.

82
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I lost.

83
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Yes.

84
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Let's go.

85
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I'm sorry.

86
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Let's go.

87
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I'm sorry.

88
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Let's go.

89
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I'm sorry.

90
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Let's go.

91
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
It hurts.

92
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
My body hurts.

93
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
It hurts.

94
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I have a cold.

95
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Hanazaki.

96
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Yes.

97
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Hey.

98
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Bring that ball.

99
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Let's go.

100
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Let's go.

101
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Let's go.

102
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Bring that ball.

103
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Bring it.

104
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Bring it.

105
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Bring it.

106
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
What are you doing?

107
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
What are you doing?

108
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Bring it.

109
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I can't.

110
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I'm sorry.

111
00:05:53,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I'm sorry.

112
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I'm sorry.

113
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I'm going to cry.

114
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I'm going to cry.

115
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Next time,

116
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
The other day, I went to Karaoke thinking I'd forgotten.

117
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I can't sing at all.

118
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I'm not a turtle.

119
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I'm a water turtle.

120
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I'm not a turtle.

121
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I'm a water turtle.

122
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I can't sing at all.

123
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I can't sing at all.

124
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I'm not a turtle.

125
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I'm not a turtle.

126
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I can't sing at all.

127
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:56,000
It's about 10 meters high, so it's going to be 4,000 meters.

128
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
It's still 1 in 4.

129
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
It's the worst.

130
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
It's 3,500 meters now.

131
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
It's 3,500 meters.

132
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:25,000
It's almost there.

133
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Here we go.

134
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:05,000
The other day, I went to Karaoke thinking I'd forgotten.

135
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I can't sing at all.

136
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I'm not a turtle.

137
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I'm a water turtle.

138
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I can't sing at all.

139
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I'm not a turtle.

140
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I can't sing at all.

141
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I can't sing at all.

142
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I can't sing at all.

143
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I'm not a turtle.

144
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I'm going down.

145
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I'm going down.

146
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Hamada-san!

147
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Do you understand?

148
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I'm waving my hand.

149
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I can hear his voice!

150
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I can hear his voice!

151
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
He's saying something.

152
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I'm going down.

153
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Hey!

154
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I'm going down.

155
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I'm going down.

156
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I'm going down.

157
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Hey!

158
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I'm waving my hand.

159
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I'm going down.

160
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I'm going down.

161
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I'm going down.

162
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I'm going down.

163
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Congratulations!

164
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I'm going to take it off.

165
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I can't express it in words.

166
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Thank you very much.

167
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
You're welcome.

168
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Please come again.

169
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I'm moved.

170
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Thank you very much.

171
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Next is a project.

172
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
It's called the 1000 people project.

173
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Let's play dodgeball with 1000 people.

174
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I wonder if I can do it.

175
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
That's how it started.

176
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
For the time being,

177
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
It was 500 people vs 500 people.

178
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
We played dodgeball with 1000 people.

179
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
The losing team will be punished.

180
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
That's what I'm saying.

181
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
That day,

182
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I lost again.

183
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I rode a roller coaster.

184
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
When I got on the roller coaster,

185
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Everyone was wearing a bald head.

186
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I'm going to ride a roller coaster.

187
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
The bald head is funny.

188
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
It's stupid.

189
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Please take a look.

190
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
It's a ball.

191
00:11:45,000 --> 00:12:03,000
It's a ball.

192
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:19,000
It's a ball.

193
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Are you ready?

194
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Why are you playing dodgeball with your fans?

195
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
You have to be punished.

196
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:45,000
It looks dangerous.

197
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I hate it.

198
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I hate it.

199
00:12:53,000 --> 00:13:01,000
40 meters.

200
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:16,000
The lips are cute.

201
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:45,000
It's very high.

202
00:13:45,000 --> 00:14:13,000
It's very high.

203
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:33,000
It's very high.

204
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Don't move.

205
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,000
This is the scariest song.

206
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
It's very scary.

207
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I was talking to him.

208
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
He said,

209
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
If I play dodgeball,

210
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I can return the ball with my bare hands.

211
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
He said,

212
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I can return the ball with my bare hands.

213
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I did it.

214
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
If I can't return the ball,

215
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I'll be punished.

216
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I was punished.

217
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,000
It hurts.

218
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Why did you do that?

219
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Why did you do that?

220
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Don't move.

221
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
We don't know what it is.

222
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
We don't know what it is.

223
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
We don't know what it is.

224
00:15:45,000 --> 00:16:01,000
It's like a video game.

225
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
It hurts.

226
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
It's noisy.

227
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
It hurts.

228
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
My hands are cold.

229
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:17,000
It hurts.

230
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I'm not cool.

231
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
That's all.

232
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:29,000
We'll do our best to promote our program.

233
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Thank you.

234
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Let's go over there.

235
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Our work is done.

236
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,000
What time is it?

237
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,000
It's 1 o'clock in the evening.

238
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
There are no kids in downtown.

239
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Do you want to see it?

240
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Do you want to see it?

241
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
It's 1 o'clock in the evening.

242
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:09,000
There are no kids in downtown.

243
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Do you want to see it?

244
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Let's do our best.

245
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
It's 1 o'clock in the evening.

246
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
There are no kids in downtown.

247
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Do you want to see it?

248
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
It's 1 o'clock in the evening.

249
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
There are no kids in downtown.

250
00:17:50,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Do you want to see it?

251
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:20,000
It's 1 o'clock in the evening.

252
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:30,000
It's 1 o'clock in the evening.

253
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:58,000
It's 1 o'clock in the evening.

254
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:10,000
It smells really bad.

255
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
It's OK.

256
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I'm doing it now.

257
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Who does this when they do makeup?

258
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Let me introduce my wonderful partner.

259
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,000
She is...

260
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Ms. Ikue Kakiwara.

261
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:42,000
She is eating the bento.

262
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:50,000
She is a big girl.

263
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:59,000
She is a big girl.

264
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Nice to meet you.

265
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Welcome.

266
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Do you want to see it?

267
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Welcome.

268
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:04,000
I'm doing one more thing.

269
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I'm going to a hair salon.

270
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:13,000
I'm going to see the hair salon.

271
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
I'm going to see the hair salon.

272
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I think she will come next week.

273
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:32,000
I didn't have confidence.

274
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:54,000
I didn't have confidence.

275
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:03,000
I'm going to see the hair salon.

276
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I'm going to see the hair salon.

277
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:21,000
I'm going to see the hair salon.

278
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:26,000
I'm going to see the hair salon.
