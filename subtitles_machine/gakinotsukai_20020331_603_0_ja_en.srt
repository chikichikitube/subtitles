1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The next day

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
This straw is the same as the straw that came during the power outage

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
What do you mean?

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
The straw that came during the power outage

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Last week?

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Ah, that's right

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
It's the same

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Then why didn't you say it a week ago?

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
It's not like you're going to say it now

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
It's a bit small

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Why?

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
What?

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Why did you come again?

14
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I'm sorry

15
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
That's none of our business

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
This program is brought to you by the following sponsors

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I don't know what's going to happen

18
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
If you say that, I don't know if I'm going to get angry here

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I want you to get angry

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I really want you to get angry

21
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
My back hurts

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Really?

23
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
It's been a while since I had a backache

24
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
To be honest, this isn't the time to be talking

25
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I want to go back to Ichimoku-san

26
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
What's wrong with that?

27
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I want to go back barefoot

28
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I don't want to go barefoot

29
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I'm really sorry

30
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Do you have any feelings?

31
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I don't have any reason

32
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
You just have a backache?

33
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I have a backache

34
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
To be honest

35
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Really?

36
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
That's right

37
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
What are you doing?

38
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
What did you do to your partner?

39
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I don't know if my back hurts

40
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I've never had a backache

41
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Do you have any feelings? This is really hard

42
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Right now, it's about level 2

43
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I've been to level 8

44
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
No, it's about level 7

45
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Where's the highest level?

46
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
At that time...

47
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I don't know

48
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
It's level 6

49
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
That's your goal

50
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I don't know

51
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
It's level 6

52
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
It's level 6

53
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
It's really hard to brush your teeth

54
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Humans don't notice unless they're worried

55
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
It's okay if you do it like this

56
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
If you do it like this, it's okay

57
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
You can't bend over

58
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
You can't bend over

59
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
You can do it like this

60
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
You can do it like this

61
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
What do you mean?

62
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
You can do it like this

63
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
You can do it like this

64
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
You can do it like this

65
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
You can do it like a man

66
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
You can do it like this

67
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
You can do it like this

68
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
But it's not always like that

69
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
It's hard to wash your hair

70
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I see

71
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Why don't you take a shower and do it like this?

72
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
That's right

73
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
You have to do it like this

74
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Like this

75
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
It's really hard

76
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
You can't do it at once

77
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Really?

78
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
You can't do it at 23

79
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
You can do it at 22

80
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I'm sorry

81
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I can do it at any age

82
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
You can do it at any age

83
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
You can do it at 20

84
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
You can do it at 2 or 3

85
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
You can do it at 20

86
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
You can do it at 10

87
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
That's the only way

88
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
In the morning when I was about to put on my socks

89
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
When I was about to put on my socks

90
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I heard a thud

91
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
It came suddenly so I had to be careful

92
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I heard a thud

93
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
You fell?

94
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I fell

95
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I heard a thud

96
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
From there?

97
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
From there

98
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Really?

99
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Really

100
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I can't do it anymore

101
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
It doesn't hurt

102
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I'm not saying it hurts

103
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
No

104
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
If you stay still it will hurt

105
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
It hurts

106
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
It hurts

107
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
It hurts

108
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
It's flickering

109
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
It's tingling

110
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
That's not it

111
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
It can't be helped

112
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
If you get more tired it will hurt more

113
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
That's fine

114
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I'm sorry

115
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
You don't have to say it

116
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Really

117
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
This year the cherry blossoms bloomed quickly

118
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
That's right

119
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
That's good

120
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
How was it? Did you see the cherry blossoms?

121
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I didn't

122
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
You didn't?

123
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I didn't see the cherry blossoms

124
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
You didn't see the cherry blossoms

125
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I'm sorry but to be honest

126
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I don't think the cherry blossoms are pretty

127
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
What is it?

128
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
The people who are excited

129
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
That's the only way

130
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
What do you mean?

131
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
What do you mean?

132
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
There's no other way than drinking and getting excited

133
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,000
The cherry blossoms are pretty when you look at them from a distance

134
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
What do you do when you dive into them?

135
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
You can see them even if you don't dive

136
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
You can see them even if you don't dive

137
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
You don't see them, right?

138
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
You only look at them like this

139
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
No, you can see them

140
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
It's the first time I've seen them from a distance

141
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
You didn't say they were pretty

142
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I want them to be bigger

143
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
The villas

144
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
They're big

145
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,000
If they were even bigger, I'd be even more excited

146
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
You'd be excited even if you didn't drink

147
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
If they were this big

148
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
They're amazing

149
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
If they were this big, I'd be excited

150
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
That's no good

151
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I'm really sorry

152
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
No, it's okay

153
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I'm sorry

154
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
No, it's okay

155
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I'm sorry

156
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Let's move on

157
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
He hasn't introduced himself yet

158
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Right?

159
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:46,000
If there was a Japanese Katsura leader, I'd definitely ask Matsumoto-san

160
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
When do you buy Katsura?

161
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Everyone doesn't know much about Katsura, right?

162
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
What do you mean?

163
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I read a book about people wearing Katsura

164
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
There's a story about it

165
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
There's something about it

166
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
For example, if you say you bought a new car

167
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
It's obvious

168
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
If you say, how are you doing?

169
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
They'd say, I'm not doing well

170
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
But you don't say, I bought a new Katsura

171
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
So no one asks about the Katsura

172
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
So no one knows about the Katsura

173
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
It's information that can't be leaked

174
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
There's a lot of things that people can't talk about

175
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Do you buy Katsura?

176
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Do you buy Katsura?

177
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
There are only people who buy Katsura

178
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Where did you buy it?

179
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:47,000
That's fine, but they're all individual players

180
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:52,000
They'd say, this guy, this guy

181
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
You know who's wearing it, right?

182
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Yes, I know

183
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
You know who's wearing it, right?

184
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Definitely

185
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
They'd say, I don't like it

186
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Even in the elevator, they'd say, I don't know what to do

187
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
But you can't say either

188
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I know

189
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
That's the sad part

190
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
You made it for yourself, didn't you?

191
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Yes, that's right

192
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
It hurts a lot

193
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
In the winter morning

194
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Why?

195
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,000
It hurts so much

196
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
It hurts so much

197
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I don't want to do it

198
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
But you can't help it

199
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
You can't not wear it

200
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
When I wake up in the morning, if it hurts, I wear it

201
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:46,000
But in the afternoon, I wear it

202
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
So you wear it once

203
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Yes, once it's warm

204
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
You can't do that

205
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
In the winter, the wind is strong

206
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,000
You can't wear it in a post

207
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
You can't

208
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Why not?

209
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
It's really hard

210
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Did you know? Katsura only wears a button

211
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
You can take it off if you wear it

212
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
There are times when you have to take it off

213
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Katsura never wears a V-shape

214
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
He only wears buttons

215
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
It's not like that

216
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Even if you look here, you can't tell

217
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
You can't tell

218
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
It's really hard

219
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
He said it's hard if you sweat

220
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
There's no one who doesn't have anything

221
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
It's definitely growing

222
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
There's some left

223
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
There's some left

224
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
You wear it

225
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,000
If you sweat, your hair will get wet

226
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
But Katsura doesn't get wet

227
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
It's obviously wet from here

228
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Katsura doesn't get wet

229
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
That duality is amazing

230
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
He said that

231
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
He said it, didn't he?

232
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
He wrote it

233
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
He wrote it

234
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
It's really hard

235
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I see

236
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Tell me when to buy it

237
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Damn

238
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I wonder if this will end

239
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
When will you buy it?

240
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Tell me when to buy it

241
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Of course there are times when you have to buy it

242
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Of course there are times when you have to buy it

243
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
There are times when you don't know what to buy

244
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
There are

245
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
For example, when you have to buy pants

246
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Yes

247
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
When it gets dirty

248
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
That's right

249
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
That's when you have to buy it

250
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I don't know

251
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
It's when you have to buy a bra

252
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
This bra is no good

253
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
What do you mean?

254
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Even if you wear it normally, your nipples are sticking out

255
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
What do you mean?

256
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
What do you mean?

257
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
You have to wear it twice

258
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
If you wear it properly, your nipples will stick out

259
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Does a bra make your nipples stick out?

260
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I don't think so

261
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I want to hear it

262
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I want to hear it

263
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I want to hear a bra

264
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Are you sick of it?

265
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I'm sick of it

266
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I'm sick of this pattern

267
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Is that so?

268
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
It's not like that

269
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
The fabric is coming off

270
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
My nipples hurt

271
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
The cup

272
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Are you going to change it?

273
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
You can't fix the cup

274
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
It's like this

275
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
It's like this

276
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I don't do it many times

277
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
It's the inside

278
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
If you change it, it's over

279
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I don't know

280
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
When I buy a bra

281
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I want to know more than Katsura

282
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Yes

283
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
The pattern is coming off

284
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
When it gets dirty

285
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
That's when you have to buy it

286
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Really?

287
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Yes

288
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
It doesn't last that long?

289
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
It doesn't last that long

290
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
People who have money have a version

291
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Yes

292
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Like summer or winter

293
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
A version with long hair

294
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Well

295
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
That's right

296
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
If you don't wear a long version

297
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
You'll be told to go to the market

298
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Everyone will think that

299
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I'll go to the market

300
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I'll change it to a short version

301
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I'll go back

302
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
If you change it to a short version

303
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
You'll have a long version

304
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
That's amazing

305
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I don't know what to say

306
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I don't know what to say

307
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
It's so annoying

308
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I'm worried

309
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I'm worried

310
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
It's scary

311
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
It's scary

312
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
It's a kind of threat

313
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
It's not a threat

314
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
It's a threat

315
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
It's a threat

316
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
If you can say it, say it

317
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I can't say it

318
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
There are people who are important

319
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Hamada

320
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Right?

321
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Yes

322
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Actually

323
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I'll do it like this

324
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I'll do it like this

325
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I'll do it like this

326
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Your posture is strange

327
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Why are you doing it like this?

328
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
When I say it, I do it like this

329
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Why are you doing it like this?

330
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
When I say it, I'll do it like this

331
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I'll do it like this

332
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Hamada, I won't do it

333
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
This is not me

334
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
This is me

335
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I have a question for you

336
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I have a question for you

337
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
You are the only one who knows that

338
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Please teach me the transformation pose of Kamen Rider Eros

339
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
It's interesting

340
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Kamen Rider Eros

341
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Please teach me

342
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
What is it?

343
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
More than the transformation pose

344
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
What is Kamen Rider Eros?

345
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
What does it look like?

346
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
To be honest, there is a shocker

347
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
All of them are naked women

348
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
If the shocker's father is shaking

349
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I won't shake your father forever

350
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:50,000
What kind of clothes does Kamen Rider Eros wear?

351
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I only wear underwear

352
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I only wear underwear

353
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
There is no reason to transform

354
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
If you transform, you won't only wear underwear

355
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Really?

356
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I only wear underwear

357
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I'm just a pervert

358
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I'm following the rules

359
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Do you want to stop?

360
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
It's not red yet

361
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I'm doing it

362
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Please teach me the transformation pose

363
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Sure

364
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
What does it look like?

365
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I'm only wearing underwear

366
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Kamen Rider Eros

367
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,000
If the shocker's father is shaking

368
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
There is a woman like this

369
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I found it

370
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I'm doing it

371
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Shake your father more

372
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Shake your father more

373
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I'm walking like this

374
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Shake your father more

375
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Shake your father more

376
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Say something

377
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I didn't do anything

378
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
You said shake your father more

379
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
You said shake your father more

380
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I didn't do anything

381
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Say something

382
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
You said shake your father more

383
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I always think

384
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
When a hero comes out

385
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
He gets beaten up

386
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
He doesn't do anything

387
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I see

388
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I don't like that

389
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
It's discrimination

390
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
He looks bad

391
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
There were a lot of monsters

392
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I didn't do anything

393
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
There was one

394
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I was just looking out the window

395
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
There was a game

396
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
It was a game

397
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I was looking out the window

398
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I wasn't looking out the window

399
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
It was so bad

400
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
No

401
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I was just looking

402
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I was just looking out the window

403
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I was just looking out the window

404
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I was surprised

405
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
So

406
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Teach me the transformation pose

407
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
You have to transform

408
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Of course

409
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Of course

410
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
It's okay

411
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I'll do it

412
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
You guys are not evidence

413
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Right?

414
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Yes

415
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
You guys are not evidence

416
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
You guys are not evidence

417
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Wait a minute

418
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
This hero

419
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
This hero is bad

420
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Is it bad?

421
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I won't let you do what you want

422
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
It's dangerous

423
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Don't do that

424
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
It's dangerous

425
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
It's dangerous

426
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Don't do that

427
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Don't do that

428
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Don't do that

429
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Don't do that

430
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Don't do that

431
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Every year at this time

432
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I feel like there are a lot of road construction

433
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I heard that you are looking for something

434
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
other than the purpose of fixing the road

435
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
What are you looking for?

436
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
This is

437
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Well

438
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
It's been a while

439
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Should I decide?

440
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Your nose is sticking out

441
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I think it's better to decide than to wait

442
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Really?

443
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Yes

444
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
It's just a road construction

445
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I'm not looking for anything

446
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Well

447
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
If I say this

448
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
It's too obvious

449
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
To be honest

450
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I'm too cool

451
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I don't want to be hugged

452
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I'm too cool

453
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
It's okay

454
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
What?

455
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Your nipples are sticking out

456
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I'm excited

457
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Why are you excited?

458
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I'm too cool

459
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Can I decide after a long time?

460
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Are you looking for something?

461
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
What do you mean by deciding?

462
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I'll decide right away

463
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I see

464
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Can I say that?

465
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Go ahead

466
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
It's a road construction

467
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
That road construction

468
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Well

469
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Can I decide?

470
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
You should decide as soon as possible

471
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
If you wait too long, you will

472
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
That is

473
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I'm looking for organs

474
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Even if it's organs

475
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
It's annoying

476
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
It's tax

477
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
What is this way of deciding?

478
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I haven't decided

479
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I haven't said it

480
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
You've decided, haven't you?

481
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Well

482
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Hey

483
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
You've decided, haven't you?

484
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Hey

485
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
If everyone's applause and laughter say so

486
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
It's okay

487
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Why do you look like you've taken a step back?

488
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
You've decided

489
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Everyone is doing this

490
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Why can't you do it together?

491
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I'm doing it

492
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Let's do it together more

493
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Yes

494
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Follow me

495
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Yes

496
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Hey

497
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Yes

498
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
I beg you

499
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
If you do it again, I'll decide

500
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Let's do it together

501
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Really?

502
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Yes

503
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Actually

504
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:54,000
I'm looking for organs

505
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Don't say it's tax

506
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
My face is dead

507
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
My face is dead

508
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Did the audience have it?

509
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:16,000
You can't do it at all

510
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
You can't do it at all

511
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I'm sorry

512
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Do your best

513
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
I'm laughing

514
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Well

515
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Are you ready?

516
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I'll do Kamen Rider Eros

517
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Eros?

518
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Eros?

519
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Eros is embarrassing

520
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Hold it, Deshi

521
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Me?

522
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:54,000
I don't have a beard or a shape

523
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
It's Yasu-san

524
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Yasu-san is doing it

525
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
If Yasu-san says, hold it, Deshi, I'll throw it back

526
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,000
You have to throw it back

527
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Kamen Rider Eros

528
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Yes

529
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Let's do it

530
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I'm just waiting

531
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
OK

532
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:26,000
You don't have memory

533
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
It's hard

534
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
What?

535
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
It's hard

536
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
It's easy

537
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Don't choose easy

538
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
I don't have Eros

539
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Don't say it's hard

540
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I can do it

541
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
OK

542
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
It's amazing

543
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
It's amazing

544
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
It's dangerous

545
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Change it

546
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Change it

547
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,000
If you change it, it's easy

548
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Because I don't have anything

549
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Idiot

550
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:01,000
