1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
In the first episode, we're going to show you how to make a living out of this show!

2
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
What a mess.

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Good evening!

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
What are we doing today?

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
We're going to make a living out of No No Jiman Tengoku.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
You look like you want to see something.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I do.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
The judge for today is Yoshida-ken!

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm sorry, Yoshida-san.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm the judge today.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
You're the judge?

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm not just a judge.

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Right?

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
And the performer is...

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Mr. Yodo Yokomari!

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
There are songs that you can't play, right?

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
There aren't any, right?

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Well, sometimes there are.

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Oh, really?

20
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
You were playing the rumba earlier.

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I was playing the rumba.

22
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I was playing the rumba.

23
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
There are new songs, right?

24
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Look!

25
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
It's amazing that you can play the rumba.

26
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Since we're doing No No Jiman today...

27
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
That's right.

28
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
We'll play 10 songs each.

29
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
You're confident, right?

30
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm confident.

31
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Can I say it?

32
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Go ahead.

33
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
What?

34
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
C-5.

35
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
C-5?

36
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Garan-zu!

37
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Garan-zu!

38
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Where are you going all of a sudden?

39
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I'm frustrated, but I'm in front of you

40
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Garan-zu!

41
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Oh!

42
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Garan-zu!

43
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
My eyes are wet with tears

44
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Garan-zu!

45
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Garan-zu!

46
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Garan-zu!

47
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Dino!

48
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Go!

49
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Go!

50
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I'm laughing at the past

51
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I wish I could hate you

52
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
But I still like you

53
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
That's enough!

54
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I was confident!

55
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
You put too much emotion into it.

56
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
What are you trying to say?

57
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Why are you singing like that?

58
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
That's right.

59
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
It's not like that.

60
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,000
If you sing too much, the audience won't be able to hear it.

61
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Mach-chan's part isn't his own.

62
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
He imitated it first.

63
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I see.

64
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
It was good.

65
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I see.

66
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
It was good.

67
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Who is it?

68
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Who is it?

69
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Who is it?

70
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
It's a white-winged Gatchaman

71
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:58,000
flying in the sky

72
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
If you run and jump out,

73
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
you'll be a bird of a golden bird

74
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Go!

75
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Go!

76
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Go!

77
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Gatchaman!

78
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Go!

79
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Gatchaman!

80
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
GQ!

81
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Go!

82
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Go!

83
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
GQ!

84
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Go!

85
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Go!

86
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Gatchaman!

87
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Gatchaman!

88
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
That was the best!

89
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:36,680
'

90
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:44,160
Your body smells...

91
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:53,400
drunk like an alcoholic

92
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:58,400
You are a man, aren't you?

93
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:03,400
You have to live strong

94
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:12,400
Don't worry about me

95
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:24,400
I'm praying for your happiness

96
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,400
From the judge, Ken Yoshida

97
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,400
What do you think of the whole performance?

98
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,400
And which one was better?

99
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,400
When I sing, I have to be the only one who feels good

100
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,400
When I sing, I have to be the only one who feels good

101
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:38,400
I have to be the only one who feels good

102
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:44,400
And I have to stand on the beat

103
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,400
Well, that's it

104
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:56,400
The winner is Hamamitsu

105
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,400
Did you know that we are releasing a record?

106
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:03,400
Really?

107
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:08,400
This is the first time we are releasing a record

108
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:23,400
Ladies and gentlemen

109
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:28,400
Hello

110
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:33,400
Hello

111
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:36,400
What are those dirty clothes you are wearing?

112
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,400
You look so poor

113
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:43,400
These are clothes I prepared

114
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:46,400
What is this?

115
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,400
You look like a gentleman

116
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,400
I don't look like a gentleman

117
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,400
I look like a man

118
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,400
I have to do my best to make you happy

119
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,400
What is this?

120
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,400
I have to walk with you

121
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,400
That's the regret?

122
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,400
I don't think so

123
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:09,400
Your face is so poor

124
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,400
Really?

125
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,400
I don't have money

126
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,400
I went to a night club for the first time in a long time

127
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,400
It's called night club business

128
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:21,400
You are a bad friend

129
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:25,400
Tobu Zoo

130
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:28,400
What a joke

131
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:33,400
I told a joke on Tobu Zoo

132
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:37,400
I have a condition of not saying this

133
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:41,400
I don't have a TV

134
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,400
I don't know what to say

135
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,400
It's cold

136
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,400
What do you mean?

137
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,400
It's cold

138
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,400
It's cold

139
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,400
And it's far

140
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:54,400
You're not going to say anything like that!

141
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,400
Right? It took 2 and a half hours for you to come back.

142
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,400
Right?

143
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,400
I'm so angry at you for having such a long day.

144
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,400
This is not good.

145
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,400
This is not good.

146
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,400
This is not good.

147
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,400
Rakko Panda!

148
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,400
You're not going to say Koala's name.

149
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,400
What?

150
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,400
You're not going to say Koala's name.

151
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:18,400
It's a flying animal park!

152
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,400
I'm not going to say it because I don't have one.

153
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,400
I see.

154
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,400
It's fun. There are many things you can do.

155
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:32,400
The place you went to before was called Green Pier.

156
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:35,400
It's a small town in Hyogo Prefecture.

157
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,400
I can't forget it.

158
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,400
It was summer.

159
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,400
It was a hot summer.

160
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,400
It was an outdoor stage.

161
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,400
There were so many people.

162
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:48,400
There was a big fire.

163
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:52,400
The sun was burning.

164
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:56,400
It was like a new story.

165
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:59,400
I was doing a manzai.

166
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:02,400
The stairs were like this.

167
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:06,400
There was an old lady who was sitting on the top.

168
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,400
She was doing a manzai.

169
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:11,400
Suddenly, she fell down the stairs.

170
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:14,400
It was a long journey.

171
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:17,400
She was doing a manzai, but she fell down the stairs.

172
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:20,400
I thought I had to do it.

173
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:24,400
When I was doing it, a nurse came to me.

174
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:29,400
The nurse and the teacher at Green Pier ran to me.

175
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:34,400
The old lady was taken away like an alien.

176
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,400
I thought I had to do it.

177
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,400
I continued to do manzai.

178
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:41,400
It was like a fairy tale.

179
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,400
It was true.

180
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:47,400
When I went home, I saw the old lady wearing a hat.

181
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:51,400
She was wearing a straw hat.

182
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,400
I thought it was a joke.

183
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,400
I didn't believe it.

184
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,400
It was true.

185
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,400
It was like a new story.

186
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,400
It was true.

187
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:02,400
We walked a lot.

188
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:05,400
There are many things like that.

189
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:08,400
I didn't like it yesterday.

190
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,400
I didn't sleep for two days.

191
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:14,400
I didn't like it.

192
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:17,400
I went to the theater in Oza for the first time in a long time.

193
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:22,400
There was a child who was surrounded by a car.

194
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:26,400
When I went home, there were many people in the car.

195
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,400
I didn't like it.

196
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:31,400
I pulled his leg.

197
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:35,400
He came to the car.

198
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:39,400
I think it's bad.

199
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,400
I didn't like it.

200
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:43,400
I didn't like it.

201
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,400
I didn't like it.

202
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,400
There was a car behind me.

203
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,400
I couldn't move forward.

204
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,400
I couldn't stop.

205
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,400
I was walking slowly.

206
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,400
He came to me.

207
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,400
I didn't like it.

208
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:02,400
I didn't like it.

209
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,400
It was true.

210
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,400
I didn't like it.

211
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:09,400
I was walking slowly.

212
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:12,400
I walked slowly yesterday.

213
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:15,400
I couldn't stop.

214
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,400
I couldn't stop.

215
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:20,400
I couldn't stop.

216
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:24,400
I couldn't stop.

217
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:27,400
I went to the station.

218
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,400
I went to the station again.

219
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,400
There was a child.

220
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:34,400
What kind of child is this?

221
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,400
I didn't like it.

222
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:39,400
I didn't like it.

223
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,400
I didn't like it.

224
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:47,400
I didn't take him seriously.

225
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,400
I couldn't help myself.

226
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:52,400
But that guy who was screaming like that,

227
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,400
If he said something like,

228
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,400
It's still like that,

229
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:59,400
Screaming like that,

230
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:02,400
I don't know what it was.

231
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:05,400
But he really had the guts to chase after her.

232
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,400
It really hurt.

233
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,400
Even if you say that,

234
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,400
The car was screaming like that.

235
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,400
It really hurt.

236
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,400
He was with his friends,

237
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:16,400
And he was crying in front of them.

238
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,400
He had guts.

239
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,400
In front of people.

240
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,400
That's why he was screaming like that.

241
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,400
After he went home,

242
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,400
He was screaming like that.

243
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,400
It happens a lot.

244
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:29,400
Yesterday, it was really bad.

245
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,400
I was really surprised.

246
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:34,400
He was screaming like that.

247
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,400
One person.

248
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,400
He was screaming like that.

249
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,400
And then,

250
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,400
He was screaming like that.

251
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,400
What was that?

252
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,400
Are you kidding me?

253
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,400
It was really bad.

254
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,400
It was like this here.

255
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,400
No, it was really long.

256
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,400
It was like this.

257
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,400
I think it was Roba-kun.

258
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,400
His shoes were really long.

259
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,400
His shoes were really long.

260
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,400
His shoes were really long.

261
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,400
I was really surprised.

262
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,400
I was really surprised.

263
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,400
Let's go to the post.

264
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,400
What?

265
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,400
What?

266
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,400
Excuse me.

267
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,400
This is the assistant.

268
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:15,400
You have a big chest.

269
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:18,400
I have a big chest too.

270
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,400
That's right.

271
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,400
I have a big chest too.

272
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,400
What?

273
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,400
Don't make fun of me!

274
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,400
What did you say?

275
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,400
So,

276
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,400
Let's do a drawing.

277
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,400
Let's do an imitation of a cat.

278
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,400
I've seen it many times.

279
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,400
I've seen it many times.

280
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,400
I'm a genius.

281
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,400
When I discovered this.

282
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,400
Let's do it.

283
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:55,400
The cat was sleeping on the roof.

284
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,400
The cat was sleeping on the roof.

285
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,400
It was crying like this.

286
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,400
I know it.

287
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,400
Let's do it.

288
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,400
No.

289
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,400
Let's do it.

290
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,400
I think it's funny.

291
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,400
Don't be angry.

292
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,400
It's funny.

293
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,400
It would be good if it came more.

294
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,400
It would be funny if it came in two stages.

295
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,400
It's like today's lunch.

296
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,400
Please say something.

297
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,400
Meow.

298
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,400
What is this?

299
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,400
Meow.

300
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,400
Meow.

301
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,400
Meow.

302
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,400
What is this?

303
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:40,400
I'm going to end my lunch.

304
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,400
I haven't slept for two days.

305
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:45,400
I don't know what's funny.

306
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,400
I bought something for lunch.

307
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,400
Is that so?

308
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,400
I can't help it.

309
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,400
Let's do a drawing.

310
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,400
Which one do you like?

311
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:57,400
The pen name is Bonobono in Kanagawa prefecture.

312
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,400
Please listen.

313
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:02,400
My brother Yoshihiro suddenly said something ridiculous.

314
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:05,400
He said he wanted to become a student in downtown.

315
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:09,400
I don't say that I can't break my brother's dream.

316
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,400
Please reply to my brother.

317
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:14,400
By the way, my brother is in the third grade of elementary school.

318
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,400
I look forward to working with you.

319
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,400
My brother's dream is that.

320
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,400
It's better to crush it.

321
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,400
Stubbornly?

322
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,400
Stubbornly.

323
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,400
I don't want to enter such a world.

324
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,400
It's not a good world.

325
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,400
This is the ninth year.

326
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,400
That's right.

327
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:35,400
I want to come out in one or two years.

328
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:38,400
The first three years.

329
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:41,400
I can't afford to eat.

330
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,400
Because you don't have money?

331
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,400
Because I don't have money.

332
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,400
I don't want to have such a terrible face.

333
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,400
You're starting to cry.

334
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,400
It's true.

335
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,400
I didn't have any money at all.

336
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:53,400
I thought it was broken.

337
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,400
You only have money in your bank account.

338
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,400
That's right.

339
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:59,400
I think people who came to play will understand.

340
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,400
I don't have money.

341
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:04,400
How far is it from Namba to Amagasaki?

342
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:08,400
I walked all the way to Amagasaki.

343
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:13,400
I don't have money.

344
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,400
Didn't you work 150 yen a day?

345
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,400
No, no, no.

346
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,400
I finished my part-time job in the morning.

347
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,400
That's right.

348
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,400
I walked all the way home.

349
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,400
That's right.

350
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,400
When I came back, I was thirsty.

351
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,400
I drank coffee milk and went home.

352
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,400
That's right.

353
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,400
It was terrible.

354
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,400
That's right.

355
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,400
I had no choice but to stay at home during the day.

356
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,400
I didn't have money to go out.

357
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,400
I didn't have money to go to the bathroom.

358
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,400
That's right.

359
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,400
I didn't have money to go to the bathroom.

360
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,400
During the day.

361
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:42,400
I had a life pattern.

362
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,400
That's right.

363
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,400
I woke up in the evening.

364
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,400
That's right.

365
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,400
I woke up in the evening.

366
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,400
At night, I was thirsty.

367
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,400
I was thirsty at home.

368
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:56,400
If I had 300 yen, I would have gone to the all-night bar until morning.

369
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,400
I went home.

370
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,400
I haven't slept yet.

371
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,400
I was awake until the evening.

372
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,400
I saw Alemin.

373
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,400
I saw her.

374
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,400
I saw her.

375
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,400
I made sure to watch her.

376
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,400
Shiga-chan.

377
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,400
I know her name.

378
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,400
Shiga-chan.

379
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,400
I fell asleep after watching Shiga-chan.

380
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,400
I woke up in the evening.

381
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:22,400
I went to the bathroom.

382
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,400
I came home in the evening.

383
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,400
I was thirsty at home.

384
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,400
I continued to watch it for two years.

385
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,400
That's right.

386
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,400
I went to wake up.

387
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,400
I slept until the evening.

388
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,400
That's right.

389
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,400
I sometimes found her.

390
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,400
That's right.

391
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,400
Hey.

392
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,400
I don't like it.

393
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,400
I think it's good.

394
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,400
I often tell my grandmother.

395
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,400
I went to buy cigarettes.

396
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,400
My grandmother said,

397
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,400
Grandma, Mild Seven Light.

398
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,400
I said, yes, yes.

399
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,400
Don't say it on TV.

400
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:52,400
What are you saying?

401
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,400
What's funny?

402
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,400
I think it's funny.

403
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,400
It's funny.

404
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,400
I said it on TV.

405
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,400
What are you saying?

406
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:04,400
I said it on TV.

407
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:10,400
When I appeared on a quiz show of a TV station,

408
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,400
I was a student.

409
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,400
I was a student.

410
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:17,400
I don't remember much when I was in elementary, middle and high school.

411
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:20,400
In particular, I was only written as a broadcaster.

412
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,400
Did you spend such an uninteresting time?

413
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:26,400
If you have a story from the past, let me hear it.

414
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,400
When did I do that?

415
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,400
When I was in junior high school.

416
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,400
This guy.

417
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,400
This guy.

418
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,400
He's a white guy.

419
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,400
I've been given a cutlet.

420
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,400
Cutlet.

421
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,400
It's everywhere, isn't it?

422
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,400
Two people.

423
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,400
In front of a candy shop.

424
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,400
Is this a smart ball?

425
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,400
In Osaka, it's called Janjan.

426
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,400
In Osaka, it's called Janjan.

427
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,400
Janjan, Janjan, Janjan.

428
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,400
It's like a bat.

429
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,400
There's a guy who does this.

430
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,400
That.

431
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,400
I was doing it when I was in junior high school.

432
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,400
When I was in junior high school.

433
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:00,400
A guy who looks bad from the other side.

434
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,400
The same age guy.

435
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,400
I was walking like this.

436
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,400
Hey, don't you have any money?

437
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,400
I was told.

438
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,400
I had a fight.

439
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,400
Two people versus one person.

440
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,400
Two people are coming from the other side.

441
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,400
No, I've already taken the other one.

442
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,400
Oh, you took it.

443
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,400
I took it.

444
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,400
I was screaming.

445
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,400
I was grabbed by my hair.

446
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,400
I was pulled around.

447
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,400
I feel sorry for you.

448
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,400
What are you doing?

449
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,400
When I looked at it.

450
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:29,400
Janjan.

451
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,400
I'm still fighting.

452
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,400
With the other guy.

453
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,400
When I looked at it.

454
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,400
A chick ran here.

455
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:41,400
Janjan, Janjan, Janjan.

456
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,400
This is the slot machine.

457
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:46,400
Janjan, Janjan, Janjan.

458
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:50,400
It came out with a coin.

459
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,400
I'd like to ask you a question.

460
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:57,400
What would you do if something like this happened again?

461
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:00,400
What if your wife was kidnapped by someone?

462
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:05,400
At that time, the criminal's request was to kill your partner.

463
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:15,400
What would you do if you could only get one of your wives or your partner?

464
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,400
Well, I'd like to ask you a question.

465
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:21,400
I don't know why you asked me such a question.

466
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:26,400
I'll help you.

467
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,400
There's nothing to help.

468
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,400
There's nothing for me to help.

469
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,400
So you don't have to kill her, do you?

470
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:36,400
My wife won't come back.

471
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,400
This is already an emergency.

472
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:42,400
It can't be helped.

473
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:46,400
You're going to abandon your wife and take me?

474
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,400
That's right.

475
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:52,400
After all, I'm gay.

476
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,400
Do you get along with Nozawa Naoko?

477
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:58,400
I'm often told that I get along with her.

478
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,400
That's not true.

479
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,400
That's the worst.

480
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,400
Why?

481
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:10,400
If you're going to take a picture of me and Nozawa walking together, that's the worst.

482
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,400
It's really ugly.

483
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,400
That's not what you think.

484
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,400
What do people think when they see it?

485
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,400
Even the worst couple gets angry.

486
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,400
Is that so?

487
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,400
Of course.

488
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:25,400
Let's say I'm going out with her.

489
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,400
I'm going to have a meal with her.

490
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,400
I'm going to have a drink with her.

491
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,400
What are you going to do after that?

492
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,400
That's the atmosphere on that day.

493
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:36,400
What's going to happen?

494
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:44,400
It's going to be a noisy and fun night.

495
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,400
I'm going to have a meal with her.

496
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,400
I'm going to have a drink with her.

497
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,400
What are you going to do after that?

498
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:54,400
If you think about it, you're going to dance with her.

499
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:02,400
Today's opening is the Nozawa Jiman Competition.

500
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,400
That's right.

501
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,400
Are you Ryozo Nogomori?

502
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,400
That's right.

503
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,400
That's the one I took last week.

504
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,400
Hey!

505
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,400
That's the one I took last week.

506
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:18,400
Thank you very much.

507
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,400
That's the one I took last week.

508
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,400
It was really fun.

509
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,400
That's the one I took last week.

510
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,400
It was really fun.

511
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:30,400
I don't know how much the TV viewers will enjoy it.

512
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,400
That's right.

513
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,400
The assistant also came out today.

514
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:38,400
I'm going to recruit more people.

515
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,400
An amateur?

516
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,400
Yes.

517
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:48,400
Please send me your photos.

518
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,400
And also, the one who is in charge of the DJ.

519
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,400
The one who is in charge of the DJ.

520
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,400
The one who is in charge of the DJ.

521
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,400
The one who is in charge of the DJ.

522
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,400
No.

523
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:58,400
I can't gather them all.

524
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:03,400
And also, the questions.

525
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:07,400
I'm waiting for your questions.

526
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,400
The answers are all the same.

527
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:15,400
The questions of the assistant and DJ are the same.

528
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,400
They are all the same.

529
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,400
Please send more questions with your photos.

530
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,400
I'm waiting for them.

531
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,400
Thank you very much.

532
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,400
Is that okay?

533
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,400
Yes.

534
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,400
The one who is in charge of the DJ.

535
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,400
That's all for this week.

536
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,400
Goodbye!

537
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:36,400
What are you doing?

538
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:50,400
This program is brought to you by Sunluck and the sponsors you are watching.
