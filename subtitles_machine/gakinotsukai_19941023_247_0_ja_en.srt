00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Chikichiki Yoshimoto High School's unique bowling tournament

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Chikichiki Yoshimoto High School's unique bowling tournament

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
It's a bowling tournament

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
It's unique

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
What does it mean?

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I don't know

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Look over there

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
It's a pin

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
It's a unique bowling tournament

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
We throw the ball while saying something

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
They are the ones who are the pins

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
They are right about what we said

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
That's right

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I thought so too

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I thought so too

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Only those people are left

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
If you say something like this, I can't be in the frame

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Even though I have a lot of work to do

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
If you say something like this, I can't be in the frame

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
But there are people who did their best

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
They are always in the frame

22
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
What is this guy?

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
We will give away 16 types of natural hot springs

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:21,000
We will give away Tatsura Parkland hot spring

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Thank you

26
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Let's take a look at the pin

27
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Do you want to touch it?

28
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I thought so

29
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
There's a small one in the back

30
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Why is he in the back?

31
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Let's go, Yamasaki Gomi

32
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Let's go

33
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:07,000
This program is brought to you by these sponsors

34
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
It's their decision

35
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
We think so

36
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I think the people at home think so

37
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I'm just saying

38
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
What are you doing?

39
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Let's go

40
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Basically, Hamada is ugly

41
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
What does this mean?

42
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
It means he's ugly

43
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I see

44
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I see

45
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
No way

46
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
He's not alone

47
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
If you think so, you can break it

48
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Next is a light one

49
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I don't know why he's so popular

50
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
It's impossible for a normal bowling

51
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Ah

52
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
He has a bitter face

53
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Please

54
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
What is that?

55
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
What is this?

56
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
You almost lost

57
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I was wondering until the end

58
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
He's amazing

59
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
He's standing diagonally

60
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
He's so diagonal

61
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I couldn't go

62
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
What are you doing?

63
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Ah

64
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I see

65
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,000
You're trying to make fun of him

66
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
It's not what I think

67
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Let's go

68
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Izumi doesn't have love for talent

69
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Mano-san

70
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
That was a good fight

71
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I know

72
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
He didn't fall

73
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
His fight was the best

74
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
The pin was shaking

75
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I see

76
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Can I go?

77
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Please

78
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Let's go

79
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Go back to Osaka

80
00:04:49,000 --> 00:05:16,000
What are you doing?

81
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I did it, but I don't like it

82
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
He's a piece of shit

83
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Stop it

84
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I have more talent than Yamazaki

85
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Ah

86
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
What are you doing?

87
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Why are you standing?

88
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
What talent do you have?

89
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
You

90
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Who is he?

91
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,000
He's a veteran

92
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
What is that?

93
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
What is that?

94
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
What is that?

95
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Mano-san

96
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Yes

97
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
It was interesting to see everyone's cut

98
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I think so

99
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,000
It was only 2 minutes

100
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Please choose the MVP

101
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Really?

102
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Yamamoto-kun from Gokuraku

103
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Let's give it to him

104
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Congratulations

105
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
He dodged it

106
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Thank you

107
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Everyone did their best

108
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Was it hard?

109
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I wonder

110
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Why don't you talk?

111
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
This kid didn't have a normal air

112
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
It's been 2 weeks

113
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
2 weeks is refreshing

114
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Really?

115
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Yes

116
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
There is a time for change

117
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
You can change your mind

118
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
You can show a different me

119
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I've been saying that

120
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
It's not because of the change

121
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Last year, I think it was last year

122
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Matsumoto is going to be 2 times more Matsumoto

123
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I've been saying that

124
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
It's 3 times more

125
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
3 times more

126
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
3 times more

127
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
That's why Hanage is like that

128
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Hanage is like that?

129
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Yes

130
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Really?

131
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Yes

132
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
That's why

133
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I agree

134
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
That's different

135
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Hanage is like that

136
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I said that

137
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I used to be weaker

138
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Hanage used to beat me

139
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I see

140
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Hanage used to beat you

141
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Hanage used to beat me

142
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
From now on, it's different

143
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Are you saying that?

144
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I'm saying that

145
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Now it's your will

146
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Don't make fun of me

147
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Now it's my turn

148
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Don't make fun of me

149
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I remember telling you that

150
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Tokyo is slow to deliver

151
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I see

152
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I found a really slow place

153
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I was surprised

154
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
It's the same place as before

155
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
It's really bad

156
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
If you look back at what happened before

157
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I used to order Tendon

158
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I waited for an hour and it didn't come

159
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I called

160
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
If I call and it doesn't come

161
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I would say, it's here

162
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I would lie

163
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I thought he would apologize

164
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I waited for an hour

165
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
He said, it's here

166
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
It wasn't here yet

167
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
It wasn't here yet

168
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
It was here

169
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
It was here

170
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
And I said, you idiot

171
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I remember that

172
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
It's been 2 years since then

173
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
You didn't ask for it

174
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I didn't

175
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I called him yesterday

176
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I can't forget

177
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
It was 11.45

178
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Which one?

179
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
11.45

180
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I came at about 15

181
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I thought I would eat while watching the show

182
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I watched it

183
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
It was here

184
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Even if it was 12.30

185
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
It didn't come

186
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
What do you think?

187
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
What do you think of your ex-wife?

188
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I don't care

189
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
45 minutes

190
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
It's a bit strange

191
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I thought it was lunch

192
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
No

193
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
It was lunch

194
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
The restaurant was busy

195
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
There was a lot of delivery

196
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Let's wait 45 minutes

197
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I'm angry

198
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
The problem is that the delivery was delayed

199
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
You don't usually wait 45 minutes at the table

200
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Well

201
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
So they

202
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
The result is 45 minutes

203
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I don't know if it's true

204
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
45 minutes

205
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
What happened?

206
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
It was almost over

207
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I wanted to eat while watching the show

208
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I wanted to eat while watching the show

209
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I just watched it

210
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I waited another 10 minutes

211
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I can't eat anymore

212
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I'm very hungry

213
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
That's right

214
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I'm very hungry

215
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Boo! Boo!

216
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
It's a warning

217
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
It's a warning

218
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I can't eat anymore

219
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I can't eat anymore

220
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Do you want to eat again?

221
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I'm angry

222
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
You are different from me before

223
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I'm an adult

224
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I'm not used to it

225
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I'm not used to it

226
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I'm sorry

227
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I'm sorry

228
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:37,000
What about Matsumoto who had a rice bowl?

229
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
That's right

230
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Something like that

231
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
What about this?

232
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I waited almost an hour

233
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I can't go out

234
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
At work

235
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I asked him to come in less than 10 minutes

236
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
My wife answered

237
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Please wait a minute

238
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
The old man said something

239
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Yes, there was a call

240
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Could you come in 10 minutes?

241
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I can't

242
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
What?

243
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
No way!

244
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
No way!

245
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
That's...

246
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
You should say that.

247
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
In short!

248
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
No way!

249
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I refused.

250
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
It's coming out.

251
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
It's strange, isn't it?

252
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I refused.

253
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
That's...

254
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
You didn't eat anything yesterday.

255
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I was told that I can't eat anything.

256
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I can't eat anything in Edo.

257
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I'm counting on you.

258
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Is it okay to allow such a thing?

259
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
But Tokyo is such a place.

260
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
The sushi restaurant I mentioned before is the same.

261
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
In the end, I don't know the restaurant, so I went back to the restaurant.

262
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I went back to the restaurant.

263
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
That's strange, isn't it?

264
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Because I didn't know the restaurant.

265
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
What?

266
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Did you burn the restaurant?

267
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
It's a sushi restaurant, so I can't burn it.

268
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I'm thinking about it.

269
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
But...

270
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
You're going to the fire.

271
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
But it's true.

272
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I ate it in the neighborhood the other day and it was delicious.

273
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I'm sorry, but the menu will be closer from now on.

274
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
In that sense.

275
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I'm counting on you.

276
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I'm shaking my hand.

277
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I'm shaking my hand.

278
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
It's not a menu.

279
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
It's not.

280
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
It's going to explode.

281
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I can't let you cut it now.

282
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
But it's me.

283
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Who?

284
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Wait a minute.

285
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I think I did it on the show.

286
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
How many minutes?

287
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
The slowest delivery in Japan.

288
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I was right there.

289
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I'm doing a lot of research right now.

290
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I'm doing a lot of research right now.

291
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
What is it?

292
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Genetic engineering.

293
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I'm going to say something difficult again.

294
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
For example.

295
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Brothers.

296
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Women's brothers.

297
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
If there's a sister and a sister.

298
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,000
The older sister is cuter.

299
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
But that's the other way around.

300
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
No.

301
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
There's no doubt about that.

302
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Is that so?

303
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:52,000
But the two brothers are cuter.

304
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Right?

305
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
What's that?

306
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
You're talking about yourself.

307
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
No, no, no.

308
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I think I did it wrong.

309
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
No, no.

310
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
But that's how it is.

311
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
It's not about the face.

312
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
It's a little bit of a jab instead of a greeting.

313
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
That's right.

314
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Let me tell you a serious story.

315
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
For example.

316
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
If the older sister is really bad.

317
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
The next one will be really serious.

318
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
That's your house.

319
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
That's not true.

320
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
You should think about your family.

321
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
How can your sister be bad and your brother be serious?

322
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
That's the same thing.

323
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
That's not true.

324
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
You're a fool.

325
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Why is that?

326
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Everyone, think about it in your head.

327
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
That's not true.

328
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
It's true.

329
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
That's not true.

330
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I know you, so I can say it.

331
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
That's not true.

332
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
You're the only one.

333
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
That's right.

334
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
What are you doing?

335
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
You can't just come in like this.

336
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
It's funny.

337
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
It's the same thing with sweets.

338
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Sweets?

339
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Yes, yes, yes.

340
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Happy turn.

341
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
That's right.

342
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
One of them is really salty.

343
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
That's right.

344
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
What is this?

345
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Yes, yes, yes.

346
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
You put salt on it nicely.

347
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Yes, yes, yes.

348
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
If you eat another one.

349
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
That's right.

350
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
That's it.

351
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
That's exactly it.

352
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
In the end, we got to this point.

353
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,000
It doesn't have anything to do with what you said at the beginning.

354
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
No.

355
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Banetan.

356
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Do you know this?

357
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
What?

358
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
It depends on the couple.

359
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Yes.

360
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,000
The woman who looks like her father is cuter.

361
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Is that so?

362
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Yes.

363
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,000
The woman who looks like her father is cuter.

364
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
This is definitely the rule.

365
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Is that so?

366
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Yes.

367
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
You look like your father.

368
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I look like my father.

369
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
You look like your father.

370
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I look like my father.

371
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
That's right.

372
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Why am I not hugging you?

373
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I look like my father.

374
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I look like my father a lot.

375
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I look like my father a lot.

376
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
My father tried to do it with me.

377
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Akiko, too.

378
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Akiko, too.

379
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Stop it.

380
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
It's me.

381
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
We are the same age.

382
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
That's how much my father looks like his father.

383
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
That's right.

384
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I had long hair.

385
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
That's not true.

386
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
That's not true.

387
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Let's move on.

388
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Yes.

389
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
When I was young,

390
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I was told to work hard without paying much.

391
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Where can I get that?

392
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Stupid!

393
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
You should work hard.

394
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Yes.

395
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
You haven't worked hard.

396
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Why?

397
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
You haven't.

398
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Am I?

399
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
What work do you have?

400
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
What work do you have?

401
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
What do you have?

402
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
What do you work hard for?

403
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
What do you work hard for?

404
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
What do you work hard for?

405
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I have worked hard on a lot of things.

406
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
What do you work hard for?

407
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,500
What kind of trouble do you have in your head?

408
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,500
I ate spicy curry.

409
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
You ate it when you were young, didn't you?

410
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
What kind of trouble did you have?

411
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I don't even have money for the subway.

412
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Shut up.

413
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I don't even have money for the subway.

414
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Did you go through the same thing?

415
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,000
You walked from the south to the south and didn't have enough money to buy curry.

416
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Is that what you mean by trouble?

417
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
You don't even have money for transportation.

418
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
If you have money, spicy curry is more trouble.

419
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
You ate it because you liked it, didn't you?

420
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
That's not trouble.

421
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
What I want to say is...

422
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
What kind of trouble do you have in your head?

423
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
That's why...

424
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,000
You walked from the south to the south and didn't have money for the subway.

425
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
What kind of trouble do you have in your head?

426
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
If I have money, I can take a taxi home.

427
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I'll save money.

428
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I'll do my best to make money.

429
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
That's what you think, isn't it?

430
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Well, it's better than thinking about it all of a sudden.

431
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
No, no, no, no.

432
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
That's what we usually talk about.

433
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I'll do my best to make spicy curry.

434
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
What are you going to do?

435
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
What are you going to do?

436
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I want water.

437
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
That's right. I know.

438
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I want water.

439
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I want water.

440
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
This is the entertainment world.

441
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
What?

442
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
What? Don't say that.

443
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
What?

444
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
What?

445
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
That's not trouble.

446
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Is it coming out?

447
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
What?

448
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
That's...

449
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Why do you sneeze when you look at the sun?

450
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I don't know.

451
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
No, no, no. If you sneeze, you look at the sun.

452
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
That's right.

453
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
You look at the light.

454
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
That's right.

455
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Don't you see it?

456
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I don't see it.

457
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
How do you sneeze when it's about to come out?

458
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Do you leave it to nature?

459
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I leave it to nature.

460
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Is that so?

461
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
If you don't do it, you don't know why.

462
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
No, I know.

463
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
You don't know.

464
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
I know.

465
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I don't do it, but when I look at this document and understand that it's true,

466
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I know that this will be like this, so it will be like this.

467
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Let me hear it.

468
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
You see the sun, right?

469
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
The sun is very hot.

470
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
You think it looks hot.

471
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
I feel different at that point.

472
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Compared to that hot sun, I'm cold.

473
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Yekki!

474
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
When it comes to dead balls, it often becomes a mess.

475
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
A professional baseball game.

476
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Why doesn't the pitcher run away when the batter hits the ball?

477
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
It's not cool to run away because you've been running.

478
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
You seem to like baseball.

479
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
You say baseball, baseball.

480
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
I like it.

481
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
I don't know much about baseball rules.

482
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Why?

483
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
I just found out.

484
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
I don't know.

485
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Is there a rule?

486
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Yes, there is.

487
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Why don't you run away after running?

488
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:40,000
If you catch a black man running, you're completely out.

489
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
It's not a ball.

490
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
If you catch the person.

491
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
If you catch the person, it's a change.

492
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I've never seen this.

493
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
All change.

494
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
I don't understand the meaning.

495
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:02,000
I know it's a change, but if it's all change, it doesn't make sense.

496
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Everything is a change.

497
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,000
I don't know how much it means.

498
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Everything in his life is a change.

499
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
That's too much to say.

500
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
But you're running from the bench and stopping it.

501
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
That's why it's a problem if it's all change.

502
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,000
It's over on the first floor.

503
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
If you catch that.

504
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
I see.

505
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
It's all change.

506
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Who said that?

507
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
The owner.

508
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,000
If you say all change, it's over.

509
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
You can't go back to the country.

510
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
All change means you can't go back to the country.

511
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
But when you're running, the owner is prepared to some extent.

512
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Of course, of course.

513
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
It's been a long time since I've seen all change.

514
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
You didn't see the change.

515
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
It's going to be a big deal.

516
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Don't you have a past?

517
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
I don't have a past.

518
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Really?

519
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Pacific Ocean?

520
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
It's not Pacific Ocean at all.

521
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Pacific Ocean.

522
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
There's no Pacific Ocean now, is there?

523
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
It's in the west now.

524
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
It's in the west now.

525
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:35,000
The Pacific Ocean is all change.

526
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
It's like, what should I do?

527
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
It's in the west now.

528
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
It's called Pacific Ocean Club Lions.

529
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
That's right.

530
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Before that, it was Crown Rider Lions.

531
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
I've done it twice.

532
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Before that, it was Nishitetsu Lions.

533
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
I've done it three times.

534
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
I've done all change.

535
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
You've done it three times in the west.

536
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
I can't do it anymore.

537
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
I can't use the name of the west anymore.

538
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
That's what it means.

539
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Tohato.

540
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
It doesn't matter.

541
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
It doesn't matter if it's in the west or in Tohato.

542
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,000
It's called Tohato All Lions.
