00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
This program is brought to you by the following sponsors.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
It's all right to talk.

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
It's all right to talk.

4
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
It ended suddenly.

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I don't know when it will end.

6
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Good evening.

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Good evening.

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Today is the 30th minute of the talk show.

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Let me be clear.

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm not feeling well.

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Who are you talking about?

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I'm not feeling well.

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I don't like the song of taxi drivers.

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm not feeling well.

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Who are you talking about?

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm not feeling well.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm not feeling well.

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I was beaten this time.

19
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
What?

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I was beaten.

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
What?

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
From the North.

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
What do you mean you were beaten?

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Did you cry?

25
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
What?

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
What are you doing?

27
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
That's dirty.

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I didn't see it.

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
You didn't see it.

30
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
It's been a long time.

31
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
It's been three hours.

32
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
The second day is three and a half hours.

33
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Did you cry?

34
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Did you cry?

35
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I'm crying.

36
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Let me be honest.

37
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I watched the first episode twice.

38
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I watched the second episode twice in the last 30 minutes.

39
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I was shooting a video.

40
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
You were watching a video.

41
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Yes.

42
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I watched the second episode twice.

43
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I wanted to cry again.

44
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I was wondering what would happen if I watched the second episode.

45
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Let me be honest. I watched the second episode yesterday.

46
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Did you cry?

47
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
That's not true.

48
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
The theme of the second episode is death and marriage.

49
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
You'll see it later.

50
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I've never seen that series.

51
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Oh, my God.

52
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I'm sorry.

53
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I don't think so.

54
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Do you think it's better to watch it from the beginning?

55
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
But I think I can keep up with it.

56
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Brother Sota is dead.

57
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Who is it?

58
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I don't know that.

59
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Brother Sota.

60
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I've never seen it.

61
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
You don't even know Brother Sota.

62
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I don't believe it.

63
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I've never seen it because I said it first.

64
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Brother Sota is Koichi Iwaki.

65
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I know that.

66
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
He's dead.

67
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
He's been alive for a long time.

68
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
That drama has been going on for 20 years.

69
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
It's hard for a person who's been alive to die.

70
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
That's true.

71
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Hodaru is getting married.

72
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Brother Sota dies before that.

73
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
His wife is going to give a speech, but Brother Sota was really looking forward to the wedding.

74
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
He was rehearsing for the speech.

75
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
He put it on the cassette tape.

76
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
He said he found it and wrote it.

77
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
A dead person congratulates him on the cassette tape.

78
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
It's like this.

79
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
It's like this.

80
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
You're a good customer.

81
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
That's what I'm aiming for.

82
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
He's dead this time.

83
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
There are a lot of strange things.

84
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
The wife of Kunie Tanaka is a great actress.

85
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
She's dead.

86
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
He's crying.

87
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Kunie Tanaka is crying.

88
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:27,000
He said he was going to get a cold, so he put something in his kimono.

89
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I saw a picture of Ayumi Ishida.

90
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I see.

91
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
He's crying again.

92
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I cried.

93
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Did you cry?

94
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,000
But before that, Kunie Tanaka was dancing naked.

95
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I asked him where he saw that picture.

96
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
There's a time limit.

97
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
He hid it here before he danced naked.

98
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
He danced naked and put it in his kimono.

99
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
You're crying because you said that.

100
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I don't care.

101
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
He's crying a lot.

102
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,000
That's what happened this time.

103
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
He's the representative of the audience.

104
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Masashi Sada's song is cowardly.

105
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
It's a song that comes out many times.

106
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
If it's a song, I'll cry.

107
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
That's not true.

108
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I'll cry even if I run naked.

109
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
That's not true.

110
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I'll definitely cry.

111
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
There's been a lot of things in the music industry, so I'll cry.

112
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:38,000
When he got bored of Masashi Sada's song, a trumpet came in.

113
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
It's no good.

114
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
That's what happened this time.

115
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Can I watch that video?

116
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I'll lend you the video.

117
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
What did you think of the next video?

118
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
It's six and a half hours.

119
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
It's three and a half hours.

120
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,000
If you watch it over and over again, you won't know which country it's from.

121
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
It's not a dirty country.

122
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,000
If you watch it over and over again, you won't know which country it's from.

123
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I have some complaints.

124
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
There's a strange scene.

125
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I don't know the meaning of Jun and Miyazawa Rei living apart.

126
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

127
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

128
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:41,000
They're living apart and working at a convenience store.

129
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
That's right.

130
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I don't know if you were an AV actress.

131
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I was an AV actress.

132
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I don't know why you're staying at home and working at a convenience store.

133
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I don't know where you're going to go if you do that.

134
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I don't know where you're going to go if you do that.

135
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Why don't you go to Vinta?

136
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I wonder if he went to a strange place.

137
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Well, I'll take a look.

138
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Please tell me.

139
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Are you going to cry?

140
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Thank you very much.

141
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
What are you going to say?

142
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
That's funny.

143
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Life game.

144
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I was bored, so I played a life game.

145
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
That's funny.

146
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
That's funny.

147
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Do you choose the salaryman course first?

148
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Business course.

149
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I chose the business course.

150
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I became a talent.

151
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
It's amazing if you become a talent.

152
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,000
When the payday comes, it's 100 or 1,000 times every month.

153
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
The salary.

154
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
It's amazing.

155
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I thought I'd be a talent.

156
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I've been making a lot of money as a talent somewhere.

157
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I couldn't stop laughing.

158
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Next time, if I stop at 3 or something, I'll be a best-seller.

159
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
If I publish a book, I'll be a best-seller.

160
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
That's why I started making money again.

161
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I made a lot of money.

162
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Suddenly, I started working part-time at home.

163
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
No way.

164
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
That's what I'm saying.

165
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I thought it was amazing.

166
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
It's a part-time job.

167
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
That's right.

168
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I was married before that.

169
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
My wife was next to me.

170
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
It's like a lie.

171
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
After I started working part-time, my wife started crying.

172
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I didn't know I hated it.

173
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I became a talent with you.

174
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
It's fun.

175
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I was a little upset.

176
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
But I've been doing it for a long time, so I'm still doing it.

177
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
That's how it is.

178
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
It's a game of life.

179
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
It's a game of life.

180
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
It's fun, isn't it?

181
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I'm not doing it.

182
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I'm going to Okinawa.

183
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
What are you going to do?

184
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I'm going on a vacation.

185
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Is that so?

186
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Yes.

187
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Are you going on a vacation?

188
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Yes.

189
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I'm going to change from this summer.

190
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
What's going to change when you go to Okinawa?

191
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I'm going to be a comedian.

192
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Why?

193
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I'm going to be bold.

194
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I'm going to be bolder than I thought.

195
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
What do you mean?

196
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I'm going to be bolder than I thought.

197
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I'm going to be more masculine.

198
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I'm going to appeal to people and walk.

199
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Left, right, left, right.

200
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
That doesn't matter.

201
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
People who are watching TV and people who are wearing this today.

202
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Yes.

203
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
It's summer.

204
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Yes.

205
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
It's very different.

206
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
What do you mean?

207
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
What do you mean?

208
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I'm going to change my hairstyle.

209
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
That's a good thing.

210
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
What do you mean?

211
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
That doesn't matter.

212
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
It's the left side.

213
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Right side.

214
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I'll reduce the length to about two millimeters.

215
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
What is your shape of the head?

216
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
It's not bad.

217
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I shaved my head when I was in high school.

218
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
It's clean.

219
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
It's round.

220
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I'm perfect.

221
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Oh, is that so?

222
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
So, there was a time when I did it smoothly.

223
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Well, it doesn't matter what you did.

224
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
What is that?

225
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
What is that?

226
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Well, I don't have a lot of opponents.

227
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I don't have any.

228
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I'm saying that, but if you really don't do it, you'll be called a liar again.

229
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
No, I'll do it.

230
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Are you really doing it in 2mm?

231
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I'll do it in 2mm.

232
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I'm looking forward to it.

233
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
When I come back to Okinawa, I'll do it in 2mm.

234
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I'm looking forward to it.

235
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Well, I think you'll be called a liar again.

236
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
You'll be called a liar by me.

237
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Well, I don't know if I'll get a tattoo.

238
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
You can't go. You can't go.

239
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Where should I go?

240
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Well, you can go here.

241
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
What are you doing in a woman's house?

242
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Well, really.

243
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
What are you doing?

244
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
It's like a devil.

245
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
What are you talking about?

246
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Are you all well?

247
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Right?

248
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Are you going back to the countryside?

249
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Well, I wonder.

250
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
It's mostly in the countryside, right?

251
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Do you know anyone from Tokyo?

252
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Look at this.

253
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
All of them are from the countryside.

254
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
It's terrible.

255
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Aren't there so few of them?

256
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Look at the face of a person from Tokyo.

257
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Are you stupid?

258
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Aren't there so few of them?

259
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Raise your hand if you're from Tokyo again.

260
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
That's all.

261
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
But it's kind of like a countryside.

262
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I'm going to watch this program and make a cup.

263
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
We're standing here, too.

264
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Where are you from?

265
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Where are you from?

266
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
For example, where are you from?

267
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I'm from Shibaragi.

268
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I'm scared.

269
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I'm scared.

270
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I'm from Ibaragi.

271
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
What are you talking about?

272
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I'm from Hyojun.

273
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I'm not from Hyojun.

274
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I'm from Yojinbo.

275
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
It's Hyojun language.

276
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Hyo-jin-bo?

277
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Hyo-jin-bo?

278
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I can't do that.

279
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I can't do that.

280
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Isn't that right?

281
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Why don't you send me something in a box?

282
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Right?

283
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
That's right.

284
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I'll send it to you.

285
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
You'll send it to me, huh?

286
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
It's summer stuff.

287
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
But it's not summer.

288
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
If you open it, it's not really summer clothes.

289
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
It's something you used to wear in the past.

290
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I see, I see.

291
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
You can wear it as a dishware.

292
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
If you open it, it's just clothes.

293
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
You just changed it in the past.

294
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I see.

295
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
That's how it is.

296
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
It's tough.

297
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
It's tough.

298
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Let's do our best.

299
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
We have no choice but to do our best.

300
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Right.

301
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I'm starting to feel blue.

302
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Then, from now on, I'll give you two minutes.

303
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Everyone, think about your parents.

304
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Besides that, play Masashi Sada's song.

305
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I see.

306
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
That's how it is.

307
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Then...

308
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Let's start.

309
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Stop it!

310
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
You were kicking a lot.

311
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Matsumoto-san says his hobby is human watching.

312
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Why do people shake the poor?

313
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
What is shaking the poor?

314
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Please tell me the identity of shaking the poor.

315
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Do you know the word for shaking the poor?

316
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I don't know.

317
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,000
You can't do anything if you shake the rich.

318
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I see.

319
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I got it.

320
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
You were imitating it just now.

321
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
That's ridiculous.

322
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,000
If you shake the rich, it means that you have money.

323
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
But I don't want to be taken.

324
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
You don't want to be taken, but you have some money.

325
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
But if you shake the poor, what do you think will happen?

326
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
That's a big deal.

327
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
That's a big deal.

328
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
You'll be scared.

329
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
You'll be scared.

330
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Even though you don't have money.

331
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Even though you don't have money.

332
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:58,000
You're shaking the cap.

333
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
The rhythm is so bad.

334
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
The rhythm is bad.

335
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Is that you're?

336
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
The rhythm is like that.

337
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
This is the rhythm of shaking the poor.

338
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Even though you don't have money.

339
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
You're shaking the rich.

340
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
You're shaking the rich.

341
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
That's long.

342
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Because you have money.

343
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Because you have money.

344
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
You're so noisy.

345
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
This is what I think.

346
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Do you think that everyone is right?

347
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:32,000
But is it a lie to say that if you keep talking about poverty, you'll become poor?

348
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
No, that's not true.

349
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I'm originally poor.

350
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I see.

351
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
That's what it is.

352
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:53,000
So you're saying that a poor person who has been seduced by a poor person is a poor person who has been seduced by a poor person.

353
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
So please look at the people who are seducing the poor.

354
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Please watch the people who are seducing the poor.

355
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
You can watch it at a coffee shop or anywhere.

356
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:05,000
The people who are seducing the poor are being seduced by a poor person.

357
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I've never seen it.

358
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I've never seen it. I've never seen it. I've never seen it.

359
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
It's in the rhythm.

360
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
It's in the rhythm.

361
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Why do people seduce the poor?

362
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I understand that.

363
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
That's right.

364
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
But now, I think there are people who do it.

365
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I do it too.

366
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Why do you do it?

367
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Do you do it?

368
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Sometimes I do it while eating.

369
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Are you saying, I don't have it?

370
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Wait a minute.

371
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I don't do it because I'm poor.

372
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I don't do it because I'm poor.

373
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I don't think you're poor either.

374
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Normally, I don't have it.

375
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
You didn't have it.

376
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
You didn't have it.

377
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,000
You didn't have it.

378
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Is it different for each person?

379
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
It's different for each person.

380
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
That's why I'm watching you.

381
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Don't you do it?

382
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I don't do it.

383
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I'm raised in the United States.

384
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
How many times do you say you're in the United States?

385
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
What are you talking about?

386
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
It's okay.

387
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
My parents didn't teach me that.

388
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Don't do it.

389
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:30,000
When you don't like it, use a knife and fork.

390
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
You put the rice on top of the fork.

391
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I'll eat it.

392
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:42,000
You have to cut the steak into small pieces first.

393
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Why are you hiding it?

394
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
My mother taught me that.

395
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Watch your back.

396
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
My grandmother told me to eat.

397
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Eat this.

398
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Eat this.

399
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Why are you hiding it?

400
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Eat this.

401
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Chew the food.

402
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Chew the food.

403
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Chew the food.

404
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Chew the food.

405
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Chew the food.

406
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,000
You're a fool.

407
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:47,000
What happens when you use Viagra?

408
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:52,000
How much do you know about Viagra?

409
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I don't know.

410
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
You don't know?

411
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I don't know.

412
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
You don't know Viagra?

413
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
You're a fool.

414
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
You're a fool.

415
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
It's easy to understand.

416
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
It's a hot topic now.

417
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
It's hard to get it in Japan.

418
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I went to buy it in Hong Kong.

419
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:17,000
It is said that drinking Viagra is good for people who have never had Viagra.

420
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I'm still active.

421
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I sell my pulse.

422
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Red and blue are like this.

423
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Red and blue.

424
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:33,000
The pulse of red and the pulse of blue are like this.

425
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
It's red.

426
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:39,000
It's coming out like this.

427
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
It's coming out like this.

428
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
It's coming out like this.

429
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
It's coming out like this.

430
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
It's green.

431
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
It's green.

432
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
You're the one who's talking about it.

433
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
What happens when you drink Viagra?

434
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
What happens when you drink Viagra?

435
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:02,000
It's going to burst.

436
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
It's not like that in the world.

437
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:17,000
When you drink Viagra, it's going to burst.

438
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
It's going to burst.

439
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
It's going to burst.

440
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,000
It's going to burst.

441
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
It's going to burst.

442
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:38,000
After drinking it for 10 minutes, it's going to burst.

443
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
After drinking it for 10 minutes, it's going to burst.

444
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Till the morning.

445
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
What was it?

446
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
It means you hear it.

447
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
If you put it simply, it means you hear it.

448
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Well maybe that's right.

449
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:59,000
For you, it's like this, but you can't do anything about it.

450
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Why is that?

451
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,000
If you drink it, you'll get used to it.

452
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,000
If you drink it, you'll get used to it.

453
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Isn't there a way to drink it?

454
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
It's like you suddenly float.

455
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
That's funny.

456
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:24,000
When the wind blows, you float.

457
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I want to drink it from the top.

458
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,000
The wind goes down, so you float.

459
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
It's Halloween.

460
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
If you come from here, you float.

461
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,000
It's entangled once, and it's like this.

462
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:45,000
In boxing matches, if the second throws a towel, it automatically means a loss.

463
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,000
What else does it mean to throw?

464
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Boxing is a lonely world.

465
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,000
No matter how much the trainer or the coach says,

466
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
it's a lonely world when the game starts.

467
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
You can't do anything about it.

468
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,000
If you throw something, you tell your opponent,

469
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
I'm thinking like this.

470
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
You're thinking like this?

471
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
So please stop it.

472
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
You mean don't hit me anymore, right?

473
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
You mean don't hit me anymore, right?

474
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I've been watching a lot of matches, so I've seen a lot of throws.

475
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
What else?

476
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
I threw a newspaper once.

477
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Does that mean anything?

478
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
That means read it.

479
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Look at this article.

480
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
It's not like that.

481
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
I'll show you later.

482
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Look at this article.

483
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
It's not good if it's after the game.

484
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I just saw it.

485
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
I'm doing it seriously.

486
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
I'll say, go.

487
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Look at this.

488
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
This child hit his parent.

489
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Look at this.

490
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
I've seen a lot of things like that.

491
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
It's not related to the game.

492
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
You can throw something that's not related to the game.

493
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
It's a lonely fight, so I'll say it many times.

494
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,000
I don't want my players to be lonely.

495
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
I'll do a lot of things.

496
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
I dig CDs.

497
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
What?

498
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
I dig CDs.

499
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I don't ask you to dig CDs.

500
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Look at this roundness.

501
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
That's the game.

502
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:39,000
It's okay after the game.

503
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
You said it's the digital age.

504
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
You know that.

505
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
In this world.

506
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
I have something to do with that.

507
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
What?

508
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
I was hit.

509
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
What are you doing?

510
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
You can't see the digital age.

511
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
What do you mean?

512
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Have you ever seen such a digital age?

513
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
I don't know.

514
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
I don't have the ability to understand.

515
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
There's no point in throwing it.

516
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:14,000
If you throw it, your players will think it's okay.

517
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Then you'll understand.

518
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:33,000
You should think about yourself and throw it.
