1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
In the pouring rain, Ikko has come

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Today, if we talk about the amusement park in Tokyo

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Gokurand

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
What?

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Yomiland

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Yes, Yomiland

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Even if we don't say it, we have come to Yomiland

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Let's have fun together

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Can we have fun?

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I don't think we can have fun

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
If you look at the weather

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
What kind of weather is this?

13
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Today, we will also have fun

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Yes

15
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The other day

16
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Yes

17
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Mr. Tanuki

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Yes

19
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
It's a great opportunity

20
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
It's a great battle

21
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Yes

22
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Chiki Chiki Heisei Tanuki Neri Gassen

23
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
No matter what happens around

24
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Two people who decided to go to Tanuki Neri

25
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Can Tanuki Neri be done as if nothing happened today?

26
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
The attractions of Yomiland are waiting for them

27
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm looking forward to Tanuki

28
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I brought it

29
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
It just appeared

30
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I'm sleeping

31
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm sleeping

32
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Even if you say something

33
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I'm sleeping

34
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'm sleeping

35
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'm sleeping

36
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Even if you are sleeping, I think you will wake up

37
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Let's have fun

38
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
These two

39
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Tanuki here

40
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I think you will be surprised to see

41
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Married

42
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Married

43
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Who is it?

44
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
This program is provided by the sponsor you are watching

45
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
It's heavy

46
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
It's heavy

47
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Isn't it very heavy?

48
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Maybe

49
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Let's leave this

50
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
This is a little better

51
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
What should I do with this?

52
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Take this Tanuki

53
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Take this Tanuki

54
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
This is not Tanuki at all

55
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
What are you doing?

56
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I hate this Tanuki

57
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
This is not Tanuki

58
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
What are you doing?

59
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Tanuki

60
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Tanuki

61
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Tanuki

62
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Tanuki

63
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Tanuki is gone

64
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
It's dangerous

65
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Why?

66
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Do you want to kill me?

67
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Rock'n'roll

68
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
This is very useful

69
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I'm OK

70
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I'm OK

71
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
This is a good one

72
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
This is a good one

73
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
This is a good one

74
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Hurry up

75
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
You guys are too much

76
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
You are too much

77
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
This is very hard

78
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Masumoto san

79
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
It's better to ride this than riding a merry-go-round

80
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Is that so?

81
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
That's right

82
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
It's better to ride this

83
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Rock'n'roller

84
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,000
First of all, it's a rock'n'roller that spins in the sky

85
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Everyone is going to enjoy riding it

86
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
What kind of Tanuki will it be?

87
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
If everyone rides it, you can't turn it

88
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
We have to broadcast it

89
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
We will do it

90
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
We will broadcast it

91
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
You can't hit me

92
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
You can't hit me

93
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
You can't hit me

94
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
You can't hit me

95
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
You can't hit me

96
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Have fun with Tanuki

97
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Yes

98
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Please

99
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Rock'n'roller start

100
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Rock'n'roller start

101
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
He has a scary face

102
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Tanuki from the east has a scary face

103
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Scary

104
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
He's back

105
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Tanuki from the east has a scary face

106
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Why?

107
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
If you don't ride it again, you won't know Tanuki

108
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Only Tanuki from the east?

109
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Tanuki from the east

110
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
If Tanaka rides with you

111
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Tanaka

112
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
If Tanaka rides with you

113
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Are you Tanaka?

114
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I'm Tanaka

115
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Please say Tanaka looking at me

116
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I don't know which one

117
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
You have a habit of reflecting

118
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
What are you doing?

119
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Say Tanaka reflected in Endo's eyes

120
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Do you understand?

121
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I don't understand

122
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Let's go

123
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Rock'n'roller start

124
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Wait

125
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Why is he doing that?

126
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
He can do it many times

127
00:05:48,000 --> 00:06:09,000
He has a scary face

128
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Tanuki from the east is coming

129
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
He's coming

130
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
He's enjoying it

131
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Tanuki from the east is dangerous

132
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
He's dangerous

133
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
He has a weird face

134
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
What should we ride?

135
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
This is

136
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
This is cute

137
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Merry-go-round is good

138
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
This is fun

139
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Next is Merry-go-round

140
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
They will go to Merhenchik

141
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Let's go

142
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,000
He's so fast

143
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:54,000
He's hitting the iron ball

144
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Hold it in front

145
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
You can lie down

146
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Lie down

147
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Down

148
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
It's over

149
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,000
This is good

150
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Be careful

151
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
He's looking at you

152
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Let's go

153
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:34,000
He's looking at you

154
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
This is good

155
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
He's hitting the iron ball

156
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
What are you doing?

157
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
This is fun

158
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Next is Tanuki

159
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Two Tanuki are singing

160
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I don't think I can sleep

161
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Did you ride this?

162
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
This one?

163
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
And the scary machine

164
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
You can't get up even if you spin in the air

165
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Why don't you get in the back?

166
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Let's get in together

167
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Let's get in together

168
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Let's get in together

169
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Let's get in together

170
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
This is weird

171
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Everyone thinks it's weird

172
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
You and I are different

173
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Let's get in together

174
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Let's get in together

175
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Let's get in together

176
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Let's get in together

177
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Let's get in together

178
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Let's get in together

179
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Let's get in together

180
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Let's get in together

181
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Let's have fun

182
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
The main character is Tanuki

183
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Don't forget to raise your hands

184
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Tanuki remembers

185
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Please

186
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Let's have fun

187
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Cool

188
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Tanuki raised his hand

189
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Let's have fun

190
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Let's have fun

191
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Tanaka raise your hand

192
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Tanaka raise your hand

193
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
It's raining

194
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Are you having fun?

195
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Tanuki

196
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Tanuki from the east, raise your hand

197
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Here he comes

198
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Tanuki

199
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Tanuki

200
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
He's fast

201
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
He did his best

202
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
They look happy

203
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
You can't go twice

204
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I'm not going

205
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Why?

206
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I want to go again

207
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Why?

208
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
What is this?

209
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:54,000
It's not fun at all

210
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Your face is even worse

211
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I'm going to shoot from the other side

212
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I'm going to shoot from this side

213
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
You're going to get wet

214
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Think about the rain

215
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Have a good day

216
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Why?

217
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Why are you laughing?

218
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
It's raining

219
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
It's raining again

220
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
It's raining again

221
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
They are exhausted from the rain

222
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
They are exhausted from the rain

223
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
They made a suggestion

224
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
It's cold, do you want to eat something?

225
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Yes

226
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
It's time

227
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
There are pork balls

228
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I wanted to eat

229
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
It's warm

230
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
It looks hot

231
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
It's warm

232
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,000
It's good for a cold body

233
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Who is it?

234
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
It's coming

235
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
What?

236
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Why did you pose like that?

237
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
It's fun

238
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
It's fun

239
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:43,000
They prepared hot ramen to warm their body

240
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Tanuki

241
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
It's coming

242
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Wake up

243
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
It's annoying

244
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Drink a lot

245
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
He is completely awake

246
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
He drank the soup

247
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
It's good

248
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
It's coming

249
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:25,000
It's coming

250
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Noodles

251
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
It's good

252
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
He is a child

253
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I want to put the soup

254
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:44,000
It's ramen

255
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
He is awake

256
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
What?

257
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
What did you do?

258
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Yes

259
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Finally, they moved the place to the room and had a fun bowling competition

260
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:10,000
The two raccoons decided to play with the raccoon

261
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Can you do it?

262
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
It's a rare opportunity

263
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I'm going to take you out

264
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:36,000
The bowling competition showed unexpected excitement

265
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,000
The winner is Hosei Yamazaki

266
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I did it

267
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
He is in his 50s

268
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
The winner is

269
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
This is the last

270
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,000
You should have done it before

271
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Let's play with Tanuki

272
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Let's do it together

273
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
This way

274
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Stand up

275
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,000
What are you doing?

276
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Let's play bowling

277
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
This is dangerous

278
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I put a bowling ball

279
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Let's have fun

280
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:51,000
What is this?

281
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
What is this?

282
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Thank you

283
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Let's help

284
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Thank you
