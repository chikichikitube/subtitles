1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Next time on the first episode of the Gaki no Tsukai Arai, we will be giving away the 1 million yen prize money for the manly badminton tournament!

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Let's do it!

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Let's get a million yen prize money.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
A million yen! That's a lot.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I've been practicing.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Badminton?

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Seriously?

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I really thought I'd do it today.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
The team division is...

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Who?

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Don't die like that.

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
What are you doing?

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Sit down.

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Don't come out.

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Hello?

16
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
What are you doing?

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I'm practicing for the musical instrument.

18
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'm sorry.

19
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Wait a minute.

20
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I don't think you can do it.

21
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Why can't you connect?

22
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
What do you mean?

23
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Wait a minute.

24
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Wait a minute.

25
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'll call you later.

26
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'll call you later.

27
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
No, I can't.

28
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I can't talk right now?

29
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Excuse me.

30
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
May I speak to you?

31
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
What?

32
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
My wife, Chiaki...

33
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I called my manager and he said he couldn't get in touch with me for 5 hours.

34
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
No, no, no. It's not like you're working.

35
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
No, no, no.

36
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
There's no way that's true.

37
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I don't usually do that. I usually try to get in touch with her.

38
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I've been married for 5 years, but I've never been in touch with her for 5 hours.

39
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
What do you mean?

40
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
You mean you want to go look for her?

41
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I want to return it.

42
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Of course, as a professional, I want to do my job properly.

43
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
But I can't get into the mood.

44
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
But you have to do it so that you can concentrate.

45
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Excuse me, can you stop it?

46
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Why?

47
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I'm really sorry.

48
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Can you let me return it?

49
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
What is he doing?

50
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Did you go somewhere?

51
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I went with him this morning, but he said he was going to a picnic land in Sagami.

52
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I didn't hear that.

53
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
At work?

54
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I don't know if it's private or not.

55
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
No, no, no.

56
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I'm sorry. I know.

57
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I know he's saying really bad things.

58
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I really know, but can you find him?

59
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
What should we do?

60
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,500
And would they still be able to find Chiaki?

61
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,500
Let's find Chiaki...

62
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
We're going to find him?

63
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,500
What the...

64
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,500
Then who in the world says we go?

65
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,500
And who are you?

66
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I don't know, but you probably go, right?

67
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:07,500
Let's seach for him, but any repeat night, we'd be able to find him.

68
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:11,500
Chiyaki's wife is gone. A big search special.

69
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,500
We've arrived at Sagami-ko Picnic Land.

70
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,500
It's long.

71
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,500
This is...

72
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,500
I'm sure there's someone in this neighborhood.

73
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,500
Chiyaki!

74
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,500
It's not early.

75
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,500
It's not early.

76
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,500
It's not early.

77
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,500
It's not early.

78
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,500
Chiaki!

79
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,500
Chi-chan!

80
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,500
Chi!

81
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:46,500
Can you call Chiaki?

82
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,500
I think she's responding

83
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,500
Chiaki! Chiaki!

84
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,500
Everyone's here! Chiaki!

85
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,500
Chiaki! Chiaki!

86
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,500
Chiaki! Chiaki!

87
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,500
Chiaki!

88
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:11,500
I'm sorry, but can I get off the car?

89
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,500
You're looking for a walk?

90
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,500
Yes, please.

91
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,500
Chiaki!

92
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:20,500
But you can tell that he's not here just by looking at him.

93
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:23,500
Chiaki!

94
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,500
He's so annoying.

95
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:27,500
He's looking for me.

96
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,500
Chiaki!

97
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,500
Chiaki!

98
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:36,500
Chi! Chi-chan! Chi-chan!

99
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:38,500
Chiaki!

100
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:40,500
Chi!

101
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,500
What?

102
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:45,500
Everyone, what are you doing here?

103
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,500
We're looking for you.

104
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,500
Chi!

105
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,500
What?

106
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,500
Everyone, what are you doing here?

107
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,500
Good morning.

108
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,500
Good morning.

109
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,500
What are you doing?

110
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:05,500
I'm here for a drama shoot. I'm going home.

111
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,500
What's up?

112
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,500
Endo.

113
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,500
You look serious. What's wrong?

114
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,500
I'm Endo Kokoro.

115
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,500
Nice to meet you.

116
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:19,500
My wife's name is Chiaki.

117
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,500
Chiaki?

118
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,500
What happened to her?

119
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,500
I haven't been able to contact them for about 5 hours.

120
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,500
I've been looking for them for a while.

121
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,500
What?

122
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,500
That's terrible.

123
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,500
We have to find them together.

124
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,500
But...

125
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,500
But...

126
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,500
It's a good thing.

127
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,500
It's a good thing.

128
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,500
No, no, no.

129
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,500
Let's find them together.

130
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,500
I'll look for them too.

131
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,500
Right?

132
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,500
But that's a little...

133
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,500
When you're in trouble,

134
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,500
you say,

135
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,500
let's help each other.

136
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:53,500
I think it's better to have more people than one.

137
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:57,500
Then, let's look for him.

138
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,500
SHIRAKUN!

139
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,500
SHIRAKUN!

140
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,500
SHIRAKUN!

141
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,500
SHIRAKUN!

142
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,500
SHIRAKUN, where did you go?

143
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,500
SHIRAKUN!

144
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,500
Sorry, thank you.

145
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,500
SHIRAKUN!

146
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,500
Chiaki!

147
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,500
Why are you here?

148
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,500
Sorry.

149
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,500
It's okay.

150
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,500
We're all in this together.

151
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:24,500
Thank you.

152
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,500
Chiaki!

153
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:26,500
Chiaki!

154
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,500
Chiaki!

155
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,500
Chiaki!

156
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,500
Chiaki!

157
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,500
Chiaki!

158
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,500
Oh, shut up.

159
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,500
Huh?

160
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,500
What's this?

161
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,500
What's this?

162
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,500
Huh?

163
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,500
Excuse me.

164
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,500
What's this?

165
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,500
Oh, this is...

166
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,500
Strawberry...

167
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,500
It's just strawberry.

168
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,500
What?

169
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:50,500
Chiaki, you collect strawberry goods, right?

170
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,500
That's right.

171
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,500
This must be Chiaki's.

172
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,500
He's definitely near.

173
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,500
Really?

174
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,500
There's too many, I don't know.

175
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,500
This must be Chiaki's.

176
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,500
Hey, Chiaki! Chiaki!

177
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,500
He's near.

178
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,500
Chiaki! Chiaki!

179
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:12,500
When I found the strawberry goods, I thought, this is it.

180
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:16,500
I knew that Chiaki-kun liked strawberry goods.

181
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:22,500
I thought it would be cute if Chiaki-kun had that strawberry bag.

182
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:27,500
This is getting worse and worse.

183
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,500
It's getting worse.

184
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,500
The fire is getting worse.

185
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:34,500
There's a little bit more up here, so let's take the bus and look for it.

186
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,500
Really?

187
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,500
Excuse me.

188
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,500
Thank you.

189
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,500
Where did Chiaki go?

190
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:43,500
He goes back to the bus to find him.

191
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:46,500
Chiaki! Chiaki! Everyone's here!

192
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:53,500
Chiaki! Chiaki!

193
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,500
Is this him?

194
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:59,500
Chiaki! Chiaki!

195
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,500
Chiaki!

196
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,500
Hey, Chiaki!

197
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,500
There!

198
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,500
Chiaki!

199
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,500
Stop!

200
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,500
Stop!

201
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,500
Stop!

202
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,500
Chiaki!

203
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,500
Don't worry about me.

204
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,500
Chiaki!

205
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,500
Hey!

206
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,500
Good morning.

207
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,500
Good morning.

208
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,500
What are you doing?

209
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,500
Good morning.

210
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,300
What are you doing?

211
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:35,300
Picnic! Picnic!

212
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:37,300
What's going on?

213
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:40,300
Chiaki is not here.

214
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:41,300
Is it Chiaki?

215
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:43,300
I'm looking for her.

216
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:44,300
Really?

217
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:45,300
Shinya Ohada.

218
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,300
Nice to meet you.

219
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:49,300
Nice to meet you.

220
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:51,300
It's not about Tanemama.

221
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:52,300
We'll look for her together.

222
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:54,300
You came here to play.

223
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,300
It's a picnic.

224
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,300
Tanemama is teaching us.

225
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:00,300
So let's go together.

226
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:01,300
Let's go!

227
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:03,300
Chiaki!

228
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,300
Chiaki!

229
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:06,300
Are you coming?

230
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:08,300
What a fool.

231
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:10,300
Chiaki!

232
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,300
Something is falling.

233
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:15,300
What is this?

234
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:18,300
There must be something nearby.

235
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,300
There's no mistake.

236
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:20,300
Is this a body part?

237
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:23,300
Chiaki is a fan of Henshin, right?

238
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,300
Yes.

239
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,300
There's no mistake.

240
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:26,300
There's no mistake, right?

241
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,300
You're not going to say anything, right?

242
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:31,300
Endo-san, there's a observation deck.

243
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,300
Really?

244
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,300
Let's go.

245
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,300
They'll definitely be here.

246
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:37,300
Let's shout from the top of the observation deck.

247
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:42,300
Jyakyuuun!

248
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:45,300
Endo-san, I'll go look down.

249
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,300
Jyakyuuun!

250
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:49,300
You're really something.

251
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:51,300
She's really going.

252
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,300
Sister!

253
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,300
Man-chan, you're amazing.

254
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,300
Sister!

255
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:58,300
She's so kind, isn't she?

256
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,300
She's really kind.

257
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:00,300
She's working hard.

258
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:03,300
I'm going to watch her again.

259
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:05,300
She's really kind.

260
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:09,300
I always thought that Endo-nii-san had a good wife.

261
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:13,300
But now that it's come to this,

262
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:16,300
I'm going to have a heart attack.

263
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:18,300
Endo-san isn't here.

264
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:19,300
She's not here?

265
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:20,300
Yes.

266
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:21,300
Okay, thank you.

267
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:23,300
Endo's gone.

268
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:27,300
How was it?

269
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:31,300
Nothing

270
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:35,300
Why? What did you see?

271
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:39,300
What's wrong?

272
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,300
Let's look for her

273
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:43,300
It's getting dark

274
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:45,300
It's a problem. She's lonely

275
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:15,800
Oh?

276
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,800
Nana-chan in the summer

277
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,800
Good morning!

278
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:18,800
Oh, good morning!

279
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,800
Good morning!

280
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,800
What are you doing?

281
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:22,300
Eh?

282
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:22,800
No, I'm...

283
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,300
I'm in the toilet

284
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:24,800
Yes

285
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,300
In the toilet

286
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:27,800
I was filming there, the AV

287
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:28,800
Ah, in a place like this?

288
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,800
Yes

289
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,300
No, I'm in the recording room

290
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:32,300
There are many things to do

291
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:33,300
There's no one here

292
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:33,800
Yes

293
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:36,300
What are you doing?

294
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,800
My wife is called Chiaki

295
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:39,300
Yes

296
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,800
She's missing and she's missing now

297
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,300
Everyone is looking for her

298
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,300
Eh?

299
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:45,300
Mr. Shiaki, you don't know?

300
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,300
Then I'll look for it with you.

301
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:49,300
No, no, no, that's really...

302
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,300
But I'm worried.

303
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:55,300
No, no, Nare-chan is so enthusiastic.

304
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:57,300
She's helping me.

305
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,300
I'd rather be alone.

306
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:01,300
Please.

307
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:03,300
Please help me.

308
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,300
Are you done?

309
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:07,300
It's over.

310
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,300
Well, there's no end.

311
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:14,300
It's getting dark.

312
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:16,300
It's getting dark.

313
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:20,300
The more people there are, the more likely they are to be found.

314
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,300
Is it okay?

315
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:25,300
Chiaki!

316
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:28,300
Chiaki!

317
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:30,300
Chiaki!

318
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:33,300
Chiaki!

319
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:36,300
What is it?

320
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:39,300
What is it?

321
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,300
What is it?

322
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:41,300
This is that.

323
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,300
This is that.

324
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:45,300
It's Nontan.

325
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:46,300
It's Nontan.

326
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,300
Nontan.

327
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,300
Ah, Nontan.

328
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:51,300
Chiyaki-chan, you're doing it wrong.

329
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:52,300
Why do you know?

330
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:53,300
You're doing it wrong.

331
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,300
So, I'm sure it's this.

332
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,300
That's right.

333
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:59,300
I think it's been about ten years.

334
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:01,300
I was doing Nontan's voice.

335
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:02,300
That's right.

336
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:03,300
Did you know?

337
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,300
It's around here.

338
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,300
Let's look for it.

339
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:08,300
No!

340
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:11,840
There's nothing to look for.

341
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:14,980
This is no good. There's nothing left.

342
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:16,300
This is impossible.

343
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:21,660
I couldn't find anything in the mountains, so I'll go to the back of the mountain.

344
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:24,580
I'll go too.

345
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:27,380
I'll go too.

346
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:28,620
I'll wait here.

347
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:30,180
Okay.

348
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:33,100
Wait a moment. I'll go with three people.

349
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,620
Three people?

350
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:35,780
Three people.

351
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:37,740
Chiaki!

352
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:40,740
Wow, look at them. Gays, actors, and AV actresses.

353
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:41,740
What?

354
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:43,740
What are these three?

355
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,740
Shiraki!

356
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:48,740
Shiraki!

357
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:52,740
They're all handsome guys.

358
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:54,740
Right?

359
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:57,740
Shiraki!

360
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:00,740
Hey!

361
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:02,740
Shiraki!

362
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:05,740
Mr. Shiyaki!

363
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:14,740
I tend to misunderstand as an AV actress, but I'm the type of person who doesn't leave people in trouble.

364
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:19,740
So I thought I could help Mr. Endo at this time.

365
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:22,740
You should have come back.

366
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:29,740
Endo!

367
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:33,740
It really looks like Houston.

368
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,740
What the hell?

369
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:37,740
No way.

370
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:41,740
There's no one here.

371
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:43,740
No response?

372
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:45,740
No response.

373
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:47,740
Mr. Ogata, you said you were a cop.

374
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:49,740
No, you can't give up.

375
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:50,740
That's right.

376
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:51,740
You can't give up.

377
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:55,740
If you give up, everything in your life will be ruined.

378
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:56,740
That's right.

379
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:57,740
So you can't give up.

380
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:58,740
Yes, I understand.

381
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:00,740
Okay, let's go.

382
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:02,740
Chiaki!

383
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:04,740
Chiaki!

384
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:06,740
Chiaki!

385
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:08,740
Chiaki!

386
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:10,740
Endo!

387
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:14,740
Chiaki!

388
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:15,740
Chiaki!

389
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:17,740
Chiaki!

390
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:13,180
Oh, that's the place where the

391
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:18,180
Hiyake!

392
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:23,180
He's the one who's next to Osaka Dome.

393
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:27,180
He's the one who's next to Osaka Dome.

394
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:30,180
He's not here.

395
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:34,180
He's next to Osaka Dome.

396
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:37,180
Good morning!

397
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:39,180
What are you doing?

398
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:41,180
What are you doing?

399
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:43,180
What are you doing here?

400
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:45,180
What are you guys doing?

401
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:47,180
We're here to talk about something.

402
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:48,180
Why?

403
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:49,180
Here?

404
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:51,180
It's been half a year since M1.

405
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:53,180
It's been a while.

406
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:55,180
Why are you talking about something here?

407
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:57,180
We're here because we're bored.

408
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:59,180
Oh, really?

409
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:01,180
Well, well.

410
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:03,180
Let's go.

411
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:05,180
What are you doing?

412
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:07,180
My wife is wearing a tiara.

413
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:10,180
I can't get it. I'm not good at it.

414
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:12,180
I'm looking for it.

415
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:14,180
But it's okay. I'll tell you the story.

416
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:16,180
That's a big deal.

417
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:18,180
We'll look for it together.

418
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:22,180
They said they'd help us.

419
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:24,180
We'll accept their kindness.

420
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:25,180
Together.

421
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:27,180
Let's look for it together.

422
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:30,180
I'll go to the back.

423
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:34,180
Chia-kun!

424
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:36,180
Chia-kun!

425
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:38,180
Hey, you're getting better.

426
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:40,180
You're right.

427
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:42,180
Chiaki!

428
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:44,180
What's that?

429
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:46,180
This is the guy who does commercials.

430
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:48,180
There's definitely someone.

431
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:50,180
The one who does the car wipers.

432
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:52,180
Chiaki,

433
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:54,180
this is the guy who does commercials.

434
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:56,180
I'm telling you.

435
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:58,180
You're doing well.

436
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:00,180
So, there's definitely someone around here.

437
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:02,180
Chiaki!

438
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:04,180
What is it?

439
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:06,180
There's a book here.

440
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:07,180
I see.

441
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:09,180
What is it?

442
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:11,180
It's in the book.

443
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:13,180
Let's look for it.

444
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:15,180
Oh, I see.

445
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:17,180
Let's look for it.

446
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:19,180
No way!

447
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:20,180
Shiro!

448
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:21,180
Mr. Rei!

449
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:22,180
It's over if you stay here.

450
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:23,180
Shiro!

451
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:24,180
Mr. Rei!

452
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:25,180
Shiro!

453
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:26,180
Shiro!

454
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:27,180
Mr. Rei!

455
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:28,180
Shiro!

456
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:29,180
Shiro!

457
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:30,180
Shiro!

458
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:31,180
Shiro!

459
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:32,180
Shiro!

460
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:33,180
Shiro!

461
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:35,180
Kiyoki-kun!

462
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:37,180
Sister!

463
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:39,180
Wife!

464
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:41,180
Wife?

465
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:43,180
I don't think you understand if it's a wife.

466
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:45,180
Can you do it in Chiaki?

467
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:47,180
Whose wife?

468
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:49,180
There are many.

469
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:51,180
Ujiin!

470
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:59,180
Yes, I never said it, but I didn't expect the worst to happen.

471
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:02,180
I thought only that I could save Inoue.

472
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:05,180
If you're alive, you can see that smile again.

473
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:08,180
I'm always talking about how ideal couple is.

474
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:13,180
I couldn't believe that his wife would end up like this.

475
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:15,180
That's weird.

476
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:16,180
Yeah.

477
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:18,180
It wasn't a good match.

478
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:20,180
Let's go to the police.

479
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:21,180
Let's go!

480
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:22,180
That's weird.

481
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:24,180
You're kidding me.

482
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:25,180
Mr. Shiyaki!

483
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:27,180
There's someone here!

484
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:28,180
Really?

485
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:29,180
Mr. Shiyaki's hair.

486
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:31,180
It's over.

487
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:34,180
Oh, Chiaki!

488
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:35,180
Chiaki won!

489
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:36,180
I'm so glad.

490
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:37,180
I'm sorry.

491
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:38,180
Thank you.

492
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:39,180
Thank you.

493
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:41,180
Chiaki, what's going on?

494
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:42,180
Chiaki.

495
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:43,180
What?

496
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:46,180
Good morning.

497
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:48,180
What?

498
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:50,180
You can't be in the middle of the sea.

499
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:52,180
What's going on?

500
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:53,180
Good morning.

501
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:54,180
Good morning.

502
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:55,180
Good morning.

503
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:56,180
Good morning.

504
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:58,180
What are you doing here?

505
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:03,180
This is a very famous place called Nakanawari no Kana.

506
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:05,180
I had a fight with a man yesterday.

507
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:08,180
I was asking him if he was coming back.

508
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:10,180
Oh, really?

509
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:11,180
You had a fight with a man?

510
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:12,180
Yes.

511
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:14,180
Why do you all look so serious?

512
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:17,180
My wife Chiyaki is missing.

513
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:19,180
I'm looking for her.

514
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:20,180
Chiyaki?

515
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:21,180
Yes.

516
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:22,180
That's terrible.

517
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:25,180
But I'll talk to Mr. Karasawa.

518
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:29,180
I don't have anything here, so I'm dressed like this.

519
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:31,180
Can I help you?

520
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:35,180
If you want to help, you have to tell me in advance.

521
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:38,180
I'll help you.

522
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:40,180
I'm a little bit scared.

523
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:41,180
I'm sorry.

524
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:44,180
Oh, I saw something shining.

525
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:46,180
It's a big one.

526
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:47,180
What is this?

527
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:49,180
There's definitely something.

528
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:50,180
There's definitely something.

529
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:51,180
It's Chiaki.

530
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:53,180
I've seen this before.

531
00:19:53,180 --> 00:20:01,180
I wonder why a young girl like Chiaki-chan ended up like this.

532
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:05,180
I want to change too.

533
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:07,180
God, please do something.

534
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:10,180
I prayed with my heart.

535
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:12,180
Chiaki-chan!

536
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:14,180
Chiaki-chan!

537
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:16,180
Where are you?

538
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:17,180
He's an old man.

539
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:21,180
He said he was an old man.

540
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:27,180
After this, Ichido kept shouting Chiaki's name until his voice was hoarse.

541
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:37,180
But, unfortunately, he couldn't find her.

542
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:40,180
The search took a long time.

543
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:42,180
Yay!

544
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:44,180
Chiaki!

545
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:45,180
Chiaki!

546
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:48,180
Chiaki!

547
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:52,180
Is Chiaki really safe?

548
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:54,180
Chiaki!

549
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:55,180
Yay!

550
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:57,180
Okita!

551
00:20:57,180 --> 00:21:00,180
I'm safe!

552
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:02,180
You've already decided.

553
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:04,180
I've already told you a lot.

554
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:05,180
I've already told you a lot.

555
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:09,180
Let's all work together and shout.

556
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:12,180
Ready, set...

557
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:16,180
SHIRAKU!

558
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:19,180
It's over.

559
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:20,180
It's impossible.

560
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:21,180
I don't have any confidence.

561
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:23,180
It's impossible.

562
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:26,180
It's impossible.

563
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:27,180
It's time to call.

564
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:29,180
It's really hard.

565
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:31,180
I'm going to call the police.

566
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:33,180
You can't say yes to everything.

567
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:35,180
It's really hard.

568
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:37,180
Hello?

569
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:46,180
Oh, really? I got it.

570
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,180
What?

571
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:49,180
I love you.

572
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:50,180
What?

573
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:51,180
I love you.

574
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:54,180
Wait a minute. What time do you finish today?

575
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:56,180
I can't do it if it's late.

576
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:59,180
It's too early.

577
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:02,180
I love you.

578
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:05,180
Sorry.

579
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:07,180
What's wrong?

580
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:09,180
I found it.

581
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:11,180
I found it.

582
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:15,180
It was in my cell phone for about 5 hours.

583
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:17,180
It was in your cell phone?

584
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:19,180
Yes. I was told to come home early.

585
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:21,180
I see.

586
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:23,180
That's great.

587
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:25,180
Thank you.

588
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:27,180
Thank you.

589
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:29,180
You saved my life.

590
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:31,180
Thank you.

591
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:33,180
Thank you.

592
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:35,180
Thank you everyone!

593
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:37,180
Thank you!

594
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:41,180
Thank you so much!

595
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:48,180
I'm sorry everyone.

596
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:50,180
Everyone, please take care of your juniors.

597
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:52,180
That's right.

598
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:54,180
I'm really sorry.

599
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:55,180
What?

600
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:56,180
I can't do it anymore.

601
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:57,180
Oh!

602
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:00,180
I got it.

603
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:01,180
Yes.

604
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:03,180
Yes, yes, yes, I understand.

605
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:09,180
My Yoyan is mine.

606
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,180
Natsumi, is that you?

607
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:12,180
Yes.

608
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:14,180
Okay.

609
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:16,180
Let's look for him together.

610
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:18,180
Let's look for him together.

611
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:20,180
Really?

612
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:22,180
I'll look for him. I've already done it.

613
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:23,180
Can we look for him together?

614
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:24,180
Yes.

615
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:25,180
Natsumi!

616
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:26,180
Natsumi!

617
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:27,180
Natsumi!

618
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:28,180
Natsumi!

619
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:33,180
Hey, Natsumi-chan!
