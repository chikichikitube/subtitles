1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
This is Kawaguchiko, which is also known as the holy place for bus fishing.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
It's been exactly a year since Downtown first challenged the black bass.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:15,000
The match between Tsurishi and Itoi was a huge victory with Hamada hitting 47cm.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
In the first round of the Tsuri Championship, Matsumoto defeated a strong opponent and won the championship.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:30,000
And now, to aim for this trophy, the best anglers in the entertainment industry have gathered here in Kawaguchiko.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,000
The second round of the Tsuri Championship, Tsurishi!

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Mr. Tsurishi.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Yes, yes.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
The second round.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
That's right.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
You're the champion of the first round.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Thank you very much.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
By the way, when the champion won the first round, the black bass...

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
He won with 28cm.

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Thank you very much.

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
And you won the trophy.

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I brought it home today.

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Oh, really?

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Yes, yes.

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
So this is the second round.

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Yes, it was a good experience.

22
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
We have a lot of fishing-loving entertainers here.

23
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Yes, yes.

24
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Let's start with Itoi Ishigesato!

25
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Hello.

26
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
From the first round, it was Itoi Ishigesato who made this corner.

27
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Originally, he dragged us into the corner and lost to me.

28
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
He gave me a humble personality.

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Itoi-san, you have to stop that dad joke for the time being.

30
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Thank you for your time today.

31
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Thank you very much.

32
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Next up is Okuda Tamiyo!

33
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Tamiyo-chan, how are you doing?

34
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
How are you feeling?

35
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Please take it home.

36
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
How are you feeling?

37
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I'm fine.

38
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
This is a little dangerous, isn't it?

39
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I bought something that was a little expensive.

40
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
It's your own suffering.

41
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
It's pretty good.

42
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Next up is Eiji Yosuke!

43
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
From the first round...

44
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
The first round was a boy.

45
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
It was just a boy.

46
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
A boy is not angry.

47
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I'm angry.

48
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
If you raise the ball, you can use a small one.

49
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
How many minutes do you have?

50
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I want to fish today.

51
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
The staff is pretty good.

52
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
It's nothing.

53
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
It's just an image.

54
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
This time, the 8th place is...

55
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Miyata Kazuya!

56
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Are you fishing too?

57
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Yes, I'm fishing.

58
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Everyone is fishing.

59
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
You like Mifuji, don't you?

60
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
How are you feeling today?

61
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
This is my second time fishing in Kawaguchiko.

62
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I've caught five fish in the past.

63
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I call Kawaguchiko an easy lake.

64
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
If I can't catch anything today...

65
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
You have to think about it a little.

66
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I'm going to cut off all my hair.

67
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I'm not happy about anyone's trouble.

68
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
There's no loss or anything.

69
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Everyone, the rule is...

70
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I'll give you two hours.

71
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
If you catch a big fish in less than two hours, you win.

72
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
How long is it?

73
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
It's the same length as my dad.

74
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Dad joke for two hours.

75
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I'm going to shut up.

76
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Let's go, everyone.

77
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Departure!

78
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:32,000
The second fishing competition is about to begin!

79
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
This program is brought to you by the following sponsors.

80
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I've been fishing since this morning, so I'm sleepy.

81
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
That's the problem.

82
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I'll win, right? I'm sure.

83
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I'm here again.

84
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I'm a sunburned old man.

85
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I'm going to be in a bad mood today.

86
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I'm a professional.

87
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I've never lost. I'll do my best.

88
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I don't think I'll be able to catch a big fish.

89
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I've got a big hook.

90
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I'll do my best.

91
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I'm going to fish today.

92
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I can't lose to Tamiya.

93
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I'll do my best.

94
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I'm the winner.

95
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
The weather is perfect for fishing.

96
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Unfortunately, it's the hardest time to catch fish.

97
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Can he catch a fish?

98
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Itoi's main boat is Matsumoto.

99
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Hamada and Miyata are on this boat.

100
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
In addition, Okuda and Eguchi get on the same boat.

101
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Damn it.

102
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
You're all sensitive, aren't you?

103
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
He quickly caught a black bass.

104
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
It's big.

105
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
As expected of a bass pro.

106
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Itoi and Miyata easily caught a black bass.

107
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Okuda.

108
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Yes.

109
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Don't give it to Eguchi.

110
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
You can't say it's a manga.

111
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I can't.

112
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I can't.

113
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
No one is talking to me.

114
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Itoi and Miyata easily caught a black bass.

115
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Don't give it to Eguchi.

116
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Please take a picture of it.

117
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I'll write your face on it.

118
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
It's Shinbo.

119
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Is it Shinbo?

120
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,000
It's Shinbo.

121
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Is Shinbo your father's line?

122
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
A little.

123
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
It's not the other way around.

124
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Hamada is lying down with a fishing rod.

125
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Will he be able to catch a black bass?

126
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Or has he already given up?

127
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
On the other hand, Matsumoto doesn't even have a fishing rod.

128
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
It's time to eat.

129
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Is this the result of the earthquake that won the last time?

130
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
A black bass has fallen.

131
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Please catch a black bass.

132
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Matsumoto is a fisherman who loves nature.

133
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
He picks up a bag with a fishing rod.

134
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
This is a bad place.

135
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
No one is coming.

136
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Hamada, Miyata, Eguchi, and Okuda are moving to find a fishing spot.

137
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Will they find the best fishing spot?

138
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Hamada, I caught a black bass.

139
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I caught a black bass.

140
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I want to help you when you don't have a fishing rod.

141
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
It's been an hour since they started fishing.

142
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Eguchi's rod is broken.

143
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
It's big.

144
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Are you serious?

145
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Eguchi, who was a bad fisherman last time, is one step ahead.

146
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:56,000
If that's how it's going to be, I can't stand it anymore.

147
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Eguchi caught a black bass.

148
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Miyata caught a black bass.

149
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Miyata also caught a black bass.

150
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
It's small.

151
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
It's better to catch a black bass in the front.

152
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
It's small.

153
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
It's small.

154
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
It's a shame.

155
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
It's a shame.

156
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
It's better than a black bass.

157
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Okuda also caught a black bass.

158
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
It's big.

159
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
This is a big fish.

160
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
This is big.

161
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Hamada caught a black bass.

162
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Really?

163
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Are you serious?

164
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Hamada can't hide his frustration.

165
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
On the other hand, Matsumoto is about to give up.

166
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Can I go over there?

167
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Let's go.

168
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
It's been half an hour.

169
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Itoi Matsumoto is going to a new point.

170
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
And Hamada Miyata.

171
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Shall we go?

172
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Shall we go?

173
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
At that time, he tried to change the point.

174
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
It's coming.

175
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
It's easy.

176
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
This is good.

177
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
This is good.

178
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
It's big.

179
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Wonderful.

180
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
This is a victory.

181
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Look.

182
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
It's being swallowed.

183
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Come on.

184
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Let's stay here a little longer.

185
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
It's coming.

186
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
It's a big fish.

187
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
It's a big fish.

188
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
He caught a big fish.

189
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
It's coming.

190
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
It's a mini bass.

191
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
It's coming.

192
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
It's small.

193
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
It's a black bass that looks like an eel.

194
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
It's small.

195
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
It's small.

196
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
It's shallow.

197
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
He threw it without a hook.

198
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Is it Okuda's pride?

199
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
He released it too small.

200
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I have a fish of this size.

201
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
He caught two fish in a row.

202
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I saw it in the picture.

203
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
On the other hand, they are fighting for a new point.

204
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Matsumoto and Itoi.

205
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I can't catch it.

206
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I caught it.

207
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Finally, Itoi caught a fish.

208
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
It's small, but I caught it.

209
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
It flew like a kite.

210
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
But I caught it.

211
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I caught it again.

212
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
He caught a fish at once.

213
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
An hour and a half has passed.

214
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Matsumoto and Hamada are the only ones who have not caught a fish.

215
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I caught it.

216
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Finally, Hamada caught a fish.

217
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I caught a fish again.

218
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Will the 47 cm fish be caught?

219
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I caught a fish.

220
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I caught a fish again.

221
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Is this a black bass?

222
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Stop it.

223
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Rockfish.

224
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
This is a rockfish.

225
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Who hasn't caught a fish yet?

226
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Tama and Matsumoto.

227
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Matsumoto.

228
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
If I can't catch a fish, I'll catch another fish.

229
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I'll try to catch a fish.

230
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I don't care if I think it's my imagination.

231
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
This fish is heavy.

232
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
But I can't catch a fish.

233
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
That's the only difference.

234
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I can use both.

235
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I don't know.

236
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:54,000
This is a rockfish.

237
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Hamada changes his hat to change his mood.

238
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I caught a fish.

239
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Is this a black bass?

240
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I caught a fish.

241
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Is this a black bass?

242
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
This is a big fish.

243
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
This is a big fish.

244
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I caught a fish.

245
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Is this because he changed his hat?

246
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Hamada caught a big fish.

247
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
This is a big fish.

248
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I'm under pressure.

249
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
At the same time, Matsumoto changed his fishing rod.

250
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
This is a big fish.

251
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
This is a big fish.

252
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
This is a big fish.

253
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
This is big.

254
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I caught a fish.

255
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
This is a big fish.

256
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I caught a fish.

257
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
This is a big fish.

258
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
He caught a large fish.

259
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Only a few hours left.

260
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:00,000
All the boats have gathered to the point where they can fish for the last time.

261
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
It hurts.

262
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I was surprised.

263
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Hamada doesn't have a fishing rod and shows a relaxed expression.

264
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Is he confident in his victory?

265
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
It's getting dark and the time limit is near.

266
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Downtown is challenging with a serious expression for the last game.

267
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
It's coming!

268
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
It's coming!

269
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
It's coming!

270
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
It's coming!

271
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
It's coming!

272
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
At the end of the game, Miyata catches a big fish.

273
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Will Miyata turn the tables?

274
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
It's coming!

275
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
It's like the last scene of Platone.

276
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
It's going well.

277
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
It's over.

278
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
It's big, isn't it?

279
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
It's not small, but it's not big.

280
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,000
It's big.

281
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
It's big.

282
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
It's big.

283
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
It's big.

284
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,000
It's big.

285
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
You should have been a cannon.

286
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Everyone is tired.

287
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I'm a winning candidate.

288
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
You said it was long.

289
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
My stomach is dented, but it's long.

290
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Six warriors who have been playing fishing battles have returned.

291
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Who will the goddess of victory smile at?

292
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Everyone is fishing, so it's fun to fish.

293
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
It was fun.

294
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
It was fun.

295
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
It's perfect.

296
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
The results are out!

297
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,000
The long battle is over.

298
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Everyone has caught a big fish.

299
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
It doesn't matter if it's a big fish or not.

300
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
It's Itoi's turn.

301
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Excuse me.

302
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Itoi has caught a lot of fish.

303
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
He said it was a big fish.

304
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I caught four fish.

305
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I caught four fish.

306
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I caught four fish.

307
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
It's big.

308
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Itoi's turn.

309
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
It's no good.

310
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
It's 36 cm.

311
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
It's 36 cm.

312
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
It's 36 cm.

313
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
It's no good.

314
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I thought I could catch all four fish.

315
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
It's no good.

316
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Thank you.

317
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
It's my turn.

318
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
It's a big fish.

319
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
It's 33 cm.

320
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
My goal was to beat Okuda.

321
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
It's 33 cm.

322
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
It's about 33 cm.

323
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
It's a big fish.

324
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,000
It would be fun if I caught a big fish today.

325
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
It's a big fish.

326
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
It's a big fish.

327
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
It's at sea.

328
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
It's bent.

329
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
36 cm.

330
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
In addition to it, is it 7 cm?

331
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I'm glad it was a 6 cm.

332
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
It's a big fish.

333
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
We can give you a towel if you weigh it.

334
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I don't need it.

335
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I don't need it.

336
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Maybe a big fish was boiled on the ship.

337
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
This is a big fish.

338
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
It's about the same for everyone, right?

339
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,000
If you add it up, it's 5, 5, 6, right?

340
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
It's about the same.

341
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Then, it's my turn.

342
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
It's big, isn't it?

343
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
It's not big, it's my turn.

344
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
It's big.

345
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
What should I do?

346
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Everyone's doing it.

347
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Do it yourself.

348
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I'm scared. I'm a fairy.

349
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
It's big.

350
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
It's a good bus.

351
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
It's heavy.

352
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I don't understand the meaning of a good bus.

353
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
It's a good bus.

354
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
It's big.

355
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I dropped it, too.

356
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I'll do it.

357
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Which one is solid?

358
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
It's me.

359
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
It's 5.

360
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
It's 7.

361
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
It's the top.

362
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Now, Mr. Matsumoto.

363
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
If I don't go to 37,

364
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
I can't win.

365
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
If you go over 37,

366
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I'll give you a double shot.

367
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
It's big.

368
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
