1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
In this season, I want to have a cool feeling.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
But it's cold.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
It's cold.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
In a different sense, it's cool.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
This is revolutionary.

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I think it's the first time I've seen it on TV.

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Let's do this cold thing.

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Let's enjoy the cold thing.

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Can you enjoy it?

10
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:31,000
This program is provided by the sponsor you are watching.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Let's show you the cold thing.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
It's the last one.

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Go!

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Are you ready?

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
It's cold.

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I think he's a good actor.

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
From the previous season.

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Is this your voice?

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
It's the same voice.

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
It's cold.

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
You can sing on TV.

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:37,000
It's time to say goodbye.

23
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
It's cold.

24
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Are you still alive?

25
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
It's cold.

26
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
It's the best.

27
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
This is the last one.

28
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
It's the best.

29
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
This is a smart guy.

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
What are you talking about?

31
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I don't know if you've forgotten the lines.

32
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I don't know if you've forgotten the lines.

33
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
It's cold.

34
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Don't you have to say it?

35
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I don't have to say it.

36
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
If you say it, it's even colder.

37
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I can't talk to you even if I say it.

38
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
In a sense, I'm a foreigner.

39
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I can't communicate with you.

40
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Really?

41
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
With this momentum.

42
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Let's get cold.

43
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
The second person.

44
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
It's cold at this point.

45
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Short story 1.

46
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Ultraman.

47
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Gaon.

48
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
It's a monster.

49
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Somebody help me.

50
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Somebody help me.

51
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Ultraman.

52
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Please.

53
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Please defeat the monster.

54
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Leave it to me.

55
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Somebody help me.

56
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
It's cold.

57
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
It's cold.

58
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
It's not stable.

59
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
How many are you going to do?

60
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Date.

61
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I'm sorry.

62
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
He's late.

63
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I've been waiting for him.

64
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Sorry to keep you waiting.

65
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Did you get it?

66
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Just a little.

67
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
You're late.

68
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I'm sorry.

69
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I've reserved a restaurant for you today.

70
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Restaurant?

71
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Yes.

72
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Did you get it?

73
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Let's go.

74
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Wait a minute.

75
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I'm sorry.

76
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I'm sorry.

77
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I'm sorry.

78
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
You got it, right?

79
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
You got it, right?

80
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Put your arms together.

81
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Let's go.

82
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Wait a minute.

83
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Don't turn around.

84
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I'm sorry.

85
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
You're not going anywhere.

86
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I'm sorry.

87
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
You're not going anywhere.

88
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I'm sorry.

89
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
You're not going anywhere.

90
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
You're not going anywhere.

91
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Put your arms together.

92
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Let's go.

93
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I'm sorry.

94
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Let's go.

95
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Let's go.

96
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Okay.

97
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Thank you very much.

98
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Thank you very much.

99
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Suzuki is very cold.

100
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
He came out and walked two steps.

101
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
He can't be that cold.

102
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I don't think so.

103
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
He walked two steps.

104
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I don't think so.

105
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I don't think so.

106
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
He came out and walked two steps.

107
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
He can't be that cold.

108
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
The third song.

109
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I'm sorry.

110
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I'm sorry.

111
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I'm sorry.

112
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,000
What is this?

113
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
What is this?

114
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:50,000
He's laughing.

115
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I didn't call you.

116
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I'm sorry.

117
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:09,000
This is terrible.

118
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
This is terrible.

119
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
This is terrible.

120
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
There are good guys and bad guys.

121
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
It's not good to have a bad guy in the team.

122
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
That was a good call.

123
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
The cold wind.

124
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
A boy will be angry.

125
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
It's too cold.

126
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Let's go.

127
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Let's go.

128
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Ready.

129
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Ready.

130
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Ready.

131
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Yaaaaay!

132
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I did it!

133
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Here you go.

134
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
This is the last one.

135
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
The last one is...

136
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
The man who loves to catch mice.

137
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
The man who also breaks the spine of mice.

138
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I can't do it!

139
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Like this.

140
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
It's a tie.

141
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Let's have him do this one.

142
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Here we go.

143
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
The man who loves to catch mice.

144
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Next, he opens his eyes.

145
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I can't do it!

146
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
First of all...

147
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I can't do it!

148
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I can't do it!

149
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
This is a water from the east.

150
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
It's quite a big water.

151
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,000
In this water...

152
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
The carbonic acid is quite calm.

153
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
He puts his face in this water.

154
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I can't do it!

155
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
He opens his eyes.

156
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Let's have him do this one.

157
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Please look closely.

158
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Please open your eyes.

159
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Thank you very much.

160
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Next.

161
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I can't do it!

162
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
This is a hose.

163
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Please open your eyes.

164
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Here we go.

165
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
He opens his eyes.

166
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
He opens his eyes.

167
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
He opens his eyes.

168
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Next.

169
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I can't do it!

170
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I can't do it!

171
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
It's my fault.

172
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
It's my fault.

173
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I can't do this anymore.

174
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
That was intense.

175
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
How was it?

176
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
It was really dangerous.

177
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
What was dangerous?

178
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I was sucked into something.

179
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Something important.

180
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I understand.

181
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Something important disappeared.

182
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
This is the last one.

183
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Takasu Michio!

184
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I can't do this.

185
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I can't do this anymore.

186
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I have to do something.

187
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I have to do something.

188
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I have to do something.

189
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I have to do something.

190
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
It's really cold.

191
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
It's really cold.

192
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Time is passing.

193
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I can't do it anymore.

194
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
What is it, master?

195
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
It's not cold. It's fun!

196
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Robo!

197
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:58,000
It's a kick!

198
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
It's not a punch, Robo!

199
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I don't understand what you said.

200
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Only I understand.

201
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
It's half broken.

202
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
It's half broken.

203
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Good!

204
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Nice, Robo!

205
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
You ran away!

206
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Thank you, Robo!

207
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
It's cold!

208
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:20,000
It's cold!

209
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
It's been an hour.

210
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
That's right.

211
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
That's what happened at the opening.

212
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Yes, yes.

213
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
You can laugh.

214
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Today's opening is terrible.

215
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I ate forbidden fruit.

216
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
It's not good to do it on TV.

217
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
What should we do?

218
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
What should we do?

219
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Everyone is watching Hamada.

220
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Everyone is watching Hamada.

221
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Why?

222
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I'm tired.

223
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
No, no, no.

224
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
No one is watching me.

225
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Everyone is watching Hana Hosettan.

226
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I used to watch Pink Lady on TV.

227
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
But now I only watch Mii-chan.

228
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
It's the same as that.

229
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Only Mii-chan.

230
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
You only watch Mii-chan.

231
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Everyone is watching Mii-chan.

232
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
What kind of Mii-chan did you watch?

233
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Everyone is watching Mii-chan.

234
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I just happened to have it.

235
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
What kind of Mii-chan did you watch?

236
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Don't say that.

237
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I want to see Downtown.

238
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I want to see Downtown.

239
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I want to see Hamada in that word.

240
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
To be honest,

241
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I'm not James Dean.

242
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
You.

243
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I don't like your attitude.

244
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
The theme is Ryunaki Hanko.

245
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
The theme is Ryunaki Hanko.

246
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I'm not going to win.

247
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I'm not going to win.

248
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I'm not going to win.

249
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
What?

250
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I see.

251
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
It's still hot.

252
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
The other day I went to eat ramen.

253
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I was a little annoyed.

254
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I'm a bad guy in the world.

255
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I'm a bad guy in the world.

256
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I'm a bad guy in the world.

257
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I know.

258
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
But even if you look at me like this,

259
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I'm the most righteous person.

260
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I'm the most righteous person.

261
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
You may not see it,

262
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
but I wear a cape.

263
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
In my heart.

264
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I always wear a cape.

265
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I see.

266
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I'm a cool guy.

267
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I'm a cool guy.

268
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I'm a cool guy.

269
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Sometimes there are people in a line at a ramen shop.

270
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I'm so angry.

271
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I'm so angry.

272
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I finished eating and I'm smoking.

273
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I can't forgive those who talk.

274
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I can't forgive those who talk.

275
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I can't forgive those who talk.

276
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I can't forgive those who talk.

277
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Iater you care about me more.

278
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I can't forgive those who talk.

279
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I can't forgive those who talk.

280
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
This will become easier happen from now on.

281
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
This will become easier happen from now on.

282
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I am forced to show my clause and Jayikawa related Eenie meenie minieligt.

283
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I am forced to show my clause and Jayikawa related Eenie meenie minie ruin.

284
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I am forced to show my clause and Jayikawa related Eenie meenie minie llike.

285
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
You can recognize mine too.

286
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Wait a minute

287
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
You see, I'm more in favor of the girl asking Ai to stop eating ramen

288
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,500
Shay-in, who are you saying this about...

289
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I'm really sorry

290
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,000
I'm just gonna ask

291
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,000
locking ears

292
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Girls these days, they go determined to make Anti- ramen

293
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:27,000
There's not enough soup

294
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Hey, I wasn't talking randomly

295
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Can you ask my mom to tell them a different story?

296
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:40,000
You're going to make soup and noodles here, right?

297
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
And I'll add some green onions.

298
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
And you'll make ramen with just a bite.

299
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
This is...

300
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Then you should eat Baby Star at home.

301
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Baby Star is different.

302
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,000
When I entered the room, the seats were all full.

303
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I was sitting down.

304
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I was hungry but I couldn't stand up.

305
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I said, please. I'll go out.

306
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I couldn't believe I couldn't do that.

307
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I didn't have a place to sit.

308
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I finished eating a long time ago.

309
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
The color of the chopsticks has changed.

310
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
It's like this.

311
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
It was in front of me.

312
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
No one can see it.

313
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I was looking at it while I was talking.

314
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I don't know this.

315
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
If you're wearing a cape, you can't go.

316
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I don't have a cape.

317
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:36,000
For example, when I'm in a car, I don't think it's bad to smoke.

318
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
You have a cigarette lighter.

319
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
When I have a lot of cigarettes.

320
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I don't think it's bad manners.

321
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000
My justice is a little distorted.

322
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
That's not good. Take off your cape.

323
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
That's not good.

324
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I can burn with a cigarette lighter.

325
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
That's paper, so it goes back to the soil.

326
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
It depends on the place.

327
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
But I can't allow it to look like an empty can.

328
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I drank a lot of juice.

329
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Do you have an empty can?

330
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I have it.

331
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I thought it was a feather.

332
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
No.

333
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
You have one or two.

334
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
You have a lot of them.

335
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I don't know that.

336
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I don't smoke, but when I stop at a traffic light, I open it and put it down.

337
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
But that's...

338
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
What is that?

339
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I do that sometimes.

340
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
It's not because the sound is noisy.

341
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I know.

342
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
There are two big reasons why you shouldn't throw an empty can.

343
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:38,000
If you say it's dangerous, it's going to be trash.

344
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Even if you put it down, it's going to be bad.

345
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:47,000
If it's allowed, it's the place where my old friend died on a motorcycle.

346
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Is that so?

347
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Don't drink it.

348
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
It's here.

349
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Don't drink it.

350
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Please also don't smoke.

351
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Yuzo Kayama and Yuzo Matsumoto are good friends.

352
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,000
When summer vacation came, they often went to Hawaii to visit their family.

353
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Please tell us how it was.

354
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I know that very well.

355
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Your dad and your friend went to a youth festival.

356
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
That's right.

357
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I think it was at the Ereiki Youth Festival.

358
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,000
My father was an actor.

359
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
He was an actor.

360
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
My father was an actor.

361
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
What kind of actor?

362
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Didn't I say this?

363
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,000
My father said, I'm a fake talent.

364
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I'm a very thin fake talent.

365
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
What?

366
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Where?

367
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
It's soft.

368
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Don't say soft.

369
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
What's your name?

370
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
What?

371
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I'm Matsumoto Joichi.

372
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
You didn't say your real name.

373
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I don't know at all.

374
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
There's a video of you.

375
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,000
It says, Matsumoto Joichi, a newbie.

376
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Because you're a debutant.

377
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I don't know if that's true.

378
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I feel like you're a newbie.

379
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
If it says, I'm a newbie.

380
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
At that time, my father went to an audition.

381
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Since then, he's been on a lot of K-dramas and movies.

382
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
He told me to tell you about the villa in Hawaii.

383
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
What kind of villa was it?

384
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
What do you want me to say?

385
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,000
He told me about the villa in Kayama Yuzo.

386
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Get out of here.

387
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
And?

388
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,000
The number of rooms is 26.

389
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
That's a lot.

390
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
That's a lot.

391
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
That's right.

392
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Why are you looking at me like that?

393
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I'm trying to remember.

394
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I'm trying to remember.

395
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I'm trying to remember.

396
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I'm sorry.

397
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
27?

398
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
It's the same as that. 26.

399
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
That's just an accordion.

400
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
That's not good.

401
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
How many rooms are there in the living room?

402
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I think there were about 30.

403
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
30?

404
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
It was a big living room of about 30.

405
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Big living room?

406
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:06,000
In that 30-story living room, my father and Kayama Yuzo had a fight.

407
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
What was the reason?

408
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I think it was because of his chest hair.

409
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:17,000
He said something like, your chest hair is not funny.

410
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Why is it not funny?

411
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
What did he say during the barbeque?

412
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,000
He put the sauce on the barbeque.

413
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Well, it doesn't matter.

414
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
He was about to cry.

415
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,000
He put the sauce on the barbeque.

416
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
He put the sauce on the barbeque.

417
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
His wife came to him and said,

418
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Excuse me, my daughter.

419
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
My father.

420
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
His name is Joichi.

421
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
He said, I'm sorry.

422
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
You don't have to apologize.

423
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
What happened?

424
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:56,000
What happened?

425
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I don't want to say anything.

426
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:03,000
My Kayama is angry.

427
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,000
He went to my father.

428
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
When I looked at him from the window,

429
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:15,000
He was very close to me.

430
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
His upper body was naked.

431
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Since then, you haven't been close to him?

432
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I haven't been close to him since then.

433
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
It was so much fun.

434
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Every New Year and summer vacation were the same.

435
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Really?

436
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
He was wearing Mongolian clothes.

437
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
It's complicated.

438
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
He was wearing Mongolian clothes.

439
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
When I was in kindergarten,

440
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
I told my parents,

441
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Mongolian clothes are complicated.

442
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Is it okay to wear Mongolian clothes?

443
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
When I was a college student,

444
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:55,000
I decided to have more than 100 secretaries.

445
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Are you a high school graduate?

446
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
No, no, no.

447
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
I'm a high school graduate.

448
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
What university are you a high school graduate from?

449
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Are you a high school graduate?

450
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
No, I'm not.

451
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Are you a high school graduate?

452
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
In Kansai,

453
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
I went to Kyodai University.

454
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:18,000
I'm a high school graduate.

455
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
What university do you go to?

456
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
One of the Business University of Kyoto.

457
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
You are very famous for becoming a director.

458
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Very famous.

459
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Most of my friends are high school graduates.

460
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,000
That's fine. Masumoto-san, you are a great actor.

461
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Please teach me how to open the door when I have an interview.

462
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Normally, you just open the door and say, excuse me.

463
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I've never had an interview before.

464
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
You've never had an interview before?

465
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
No.

466
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
I'm amazing.

467
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
I always have a good reputation.

468
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:54,000
I've always been praised for being convincing.

469
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Well, there's at least one company that has that reputation.

470
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:03,000
That's why I call it convincing.

471
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I've been convinced.

472
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
No, no, no.

473
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
I can hear it when I go home.

474
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,000
So, I don't know if that's convincing or not.

475
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
There was a big company that said it was convincing.

476
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
That's what I'm talking about.

477
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Bang!

478
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Please teach me how to open the door.

479
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
An interview?

480
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Yes.

481
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Then, please come here.

482
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Excuse me.

483
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Excuse me.

484
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
This is terrible.

485
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
It's like climbing a mountain.

486
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Am I doing this?

487
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
I can't go in and do this.

488
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
I can see the camera.

489
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
I have to take a picture of the city.

490
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
What should I do?

491
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Next person, please.

492
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Wait, wait, wait.

493
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
It's closed now.

494
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
It's closed?

495
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
I have to do my best.

496
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
It's really good to do it naturally.

497
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
I'm dressed up.

498
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
I think it's best to do it naturally.

499
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
I was able to do it that way.

500
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
For example, you ask me to write something, right?

501
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Yes, yes.

502
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Please write it.

503
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Yes, yes.

504
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
I don't usually write things like that.

505
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
I see.

506
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
What should I do?

507
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
I mean, really.

508
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:22,000
I don't care if it's like this.

509
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Why are you sleeping?

510
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Sometimes, like this.

511
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
I sometimes eat the skin here.

512
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Even if you're told to eat it.

513
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:39,000
There are times when I want to eat it because it's sticking out here, right?

514
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:45,000
I usually do it with my mouth open, but I can't reach it.

515
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
I wish I could do that.

516
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:52,000
I want to see an old man wearing a suit over there.

517
00:23:52,000 --> 00:24:17,000
I agree with that.
