00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
In the 11th episode of Gaki no Tsukai Arai, Chikitsuki! Genojin! Omae! Sou-chan-ka! Grand Prix!

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Everyone here is lucky.

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Let's go!

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Today's guests, please come out!

5
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Wait a minute, why did you come out looking so disgusted?

6
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I just matched with Otake.

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Really?

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
He really has such a cute face.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I don't want to be with a criminal.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
What are you talking about, Genojin?

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Let's introduce the guests.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
First, Mr. Otake!

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Next, Mr. Kanao!

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Next, Mr. Matsumoto!

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Hello!

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Please come out.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
You're dressed like this again.

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
What is this?

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
The last time I was dressed like this, it looked like I was from the industry.

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:21,000
This time, it looks like you're infiltrating Tama.

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
This program is brought to you by the following sponsors.

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Let's go!

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
First of all, this way!

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Your nipples are like the black of Othello!

25
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
You're sitting too low!

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Please come out!

27
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Your nipples are like the black of Othello!

28
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
That's not good.

29
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
That's not good.

30
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
That's not good.

31
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
That's not good.

32
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
That's not good.

33
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
This is completely black.

34
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
That's normal.

35
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
That's normal.

36
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
That's normal.

37
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
It's definitely black.

38
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Your face isn't like that, but what's with your nipples?

39
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Your nipples are like the black of Othello!

40
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
That's not good!

41
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
It's completely black!

42
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
That's not good!

43
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
What are you talking about?

44
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
That's not good!

45
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
No! You can't accept that!

46
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Please come out, Mako.

47
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Who's turn is it?

48
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Next!

49
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Ok, Tempest-san.

50
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:42,500
I think this person is underage, and has been beaten up a lot.

51
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,500
Oh, so the husband is underage?

52
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,000
He's being told that he's an adult.

53
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
And also, the person who has been beaten up even more.

54
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,500
Ok? Don't get angry.

55
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,500
I can't accept this.

56
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,500
Komaro-san.

57
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:04,000
Yes.

58
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I can't accept this!

59
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
What is this?

60
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I can't accept this!

61
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,000
One more time.

62
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
What do you mean you can't accept this?

63
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,500
In the quiz, you said you can't accept my answer.

64
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:20,000
What kind of person is this?

65
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Aya-kun.

66
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Aya-kun.

67
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
There are a lot of people who are underage.

68
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
That's why I'm writing this.

69
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
You should write about your acquaintances.

70
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Oh, I see.

71
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Like this?

72
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Like this?

73
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Well, let's forget about that.

74
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
What do you mean?

75
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Why did you write about Marusia?

76
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Why did you write about Marusia?

77
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Okamoto Natsuki-san.

78
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Okamoto Natsuki-san.

79
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Okamoto Natsuki-san.

80
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,500
Nijimai.

81
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,000
Konno Misago.

82
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Kisamoto Matsuyama.

83
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Kisamai?

84
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,500
Kisamoto.

85
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,500
Okamoto Natsuki.

86
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:02,000
Matsuda Seiko.

87
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Okamoto Natsuki.

88
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Nijimai.

89
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Nijimai.

90
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,500
Matsuda Seiko.

91
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,000
He's going to bite me.

92
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
He's going to bite me.

93
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
He's going to bite me.

94
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
He's going to bite me.

95
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I wanted to write Okamoto Natsuki.

96
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Natsuki's face is already like a mummy.

97
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I don't know.

98
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I don't know about that.

99
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I'm scared.

100
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
The next question is straight.

101
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Let's go.

102
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
This one.

103
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
You hate me, don't you?

104
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I don't care if it's a boy or a girl.

105
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I don't care if it's a boy or a girl.

106
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I don't care if it's a boy or a girl.

107
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I'm going to get scolded.

108
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Give me a break.

109
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I'm not the one who said it.

110
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
It's Machikazu.

111
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
It's Machikazu.

112
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
That's right.

113
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
It's Machikazu.

114
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
He's going to be in trouble!

115
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Yes.

116
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I never thought that the wishes I was going to sing today would be so heavy.

117
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Should you write what you think is the right one?

118
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Don't exposing it.

119
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
What?

120
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I don't want to open what I have to show if I don't.

121
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I'll refer you for now.

122
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I'm not the one who said it.

123
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Open up!

124
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Ok, write it.

125
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
This one is terrible.

126
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
It's like McDonald's.

127
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
It looks delicious, right?

128
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
The people in town are the same.

129
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
You'll get in trouble.

130
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Let's start with Mr. Oda.

131
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
This guy.

132
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Yes.

133
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
We've been on the show together before.

134
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Yes.

135
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
When he's having fun...

136
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Yes.

137
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I'm not having fun.

138
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
This guy seems to be having a lot of fun.

139
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
It's getting more and more fun.

140
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
It's not just Ota.

141
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Everyone's having fun.

142
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
That's what everyone thinks.

143
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Yes, everyone's having fun.

144
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Mr. Tenmei.

145
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Yes.

146
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I'm not mistaken at all.

147
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
It's Ota.

148
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
What?

149
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Isn't this a woman?

150
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
No, no.

151
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
It doesn't matter.

152
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
It's a man.

153
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Yes, Mr. Matsumoto.

154
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I have a lot of them.

155
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
This is the one I'm aiming for.

156
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
If you don't hate it...

157
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I don't have a job.

158
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
This guy.

159
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
When I was on the 24-hour TV show,

160
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
he came to me and said,

161
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
This is finally the major.

162
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I can't stand it.

163
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I don't want to be told that.

164
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Now, let's see the results.

165
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
But what about the others?

166
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Is there anything else?

167
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Who else?

168
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
No, no.

169
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Matsumoto is writing something.

170
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
This is the world's...

171
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
This guy is trying to make it two.

172
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
This is the best size.

173
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Mr. Makoto Otake.

174
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Makoto Otake.

175
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Uru Saishi.

176
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Kanda Uno.

177
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Ryo Oshiba.

178
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Kenji Muriaki.

179
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Ryutaro Kamioka.

180
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Ritsumi Pinko.

181
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Tenmei Kano.

182
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Kanda Uno.

183
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Nae Yuki.

184
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Kanda Uno.

185
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Ryo Oshiba.

186
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Kenji Muriaki.

187
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Kanda Uno.

188
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Kanda Uno.

189
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Ryo Oshiba.

190
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
This is the world's best size.

191
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
This is the first time I read this.

192
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
This is the first time I read this.

193
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
This is the world's best size.

194
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
The rest is Ryo Oshiba,

195
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Makoto Otake,

196
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Kenji Muriaki.

197
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Wait a minute.

198
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I'm in the 3rd place?

199
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Kenji, I'm tired.

200
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
You guys won't let me eat.

201
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
We're a tired stomach.

202
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Let's go.

203
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
It's because it's on that show that people hate it.

204
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
If it wasn't for this, it would be even worse.

205
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Now, let's go. Shut up!

206
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Ah, I have to do it!

207
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Eh? Was it funny?

208
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
The whole world is making fun of it.

209
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Eh? Was it funny?

210
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
What are you talking about?

211
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
This is between you and Chan!

212
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Now, please draw.

213
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
This is fine, right?

214
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
That's not good.

215
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
You're doing something good.

216
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
You're dead!

217
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I'm not dead in his eyes.

218
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
You're dead!

219
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
You're dead!

220
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
That's not good.

221
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
No, no, no, no. I'm still alive in his eyes.

222
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
No, no, no, no.

223
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
You're making it sound so beautiful.

224
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
You're dead.

225
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
No, no, no.

226
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
This is between you and him!

227
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
This is too simple.

228
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Now, Odaki-san.

229
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Yes.

230
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
He said once that he was surprised when he died.

231
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
No, that's in the movie.

232
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Tenmei-san.

233
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Yes.

234
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
So, don't act like you can't read the audience's reaction.

235
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Yamazato-san.

236
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Okay.

237
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
See? The audience's reaction is bad, right? That's why I'm called Teresa Tenya.

238
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Oya Masako.

239
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Komori no Obachama.

240
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Shiozawa Toki.

241
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Kiyokawa Nijiko.

242
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Mr. Okure.

243
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Saito Seiu-kun.

244
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Shiozawa Toki.

245
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Awaya Noriko.

246
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Sugai Kin-san.

247
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Komori no Obachama.

248
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Kiyokawa Nijiko.

249
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Wakato Akira.

250
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
She went back to the sea.

251
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Awaya Noriko.

252
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Komori no Obachama.

253
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Genji Pekin.

254
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Oya Masako.

255
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Awaya Noriko.

256
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Komori no Obachama.

257
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Komori no Obachama.

258
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Komori no Obachama.

259
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Komori no Obachama.

260
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Komori no Obachama.

261
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Shun, right?

262
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
What?

263
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
He's alive.

264
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Your d**k is in the form of a wakamokori.

265
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Please come in.

266
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Mako-chan.

267
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Tenme-san.

268
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
This is also this, right?

269
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Tenme-san, you can call me d**k.

270
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
But this one is stronger than d**k.

271
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
One more time.

272
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
What d**k?

273
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
You can't say d**k.

274
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I didn't know that at all.

275
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Liar.

276
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
How many years have you been doing this?

277
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
That's normal.

278
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I'm sorry.

279
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Don't blur it out.

280
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
It's only you.

281
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I don't like it.

282
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
You don't have to do that.

283
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Why are you blurring it out?

284
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I want you to blur it out.

285
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I don't like it.

286
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Here, take this.

287
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Where is it from?

288
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Where is it from?

289
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I want you to blur it out.

290
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
What are you doing?

291
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
There's no answer.

292
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I want you to blur it out.

293
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Well, it's started.

294
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
This is really a game.

295
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
You're just taking off your clothes.

296
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
But I went to the doctor.

297
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:54,000
And the doctors saw me.

298
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Really?

299
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
They saw me.

300
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Really?

301
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Of course.

302
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
If it was me.

303
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
That was amazing.

304
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Really?

305
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
That was really good.

306
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
It was like when the genius d**k, Hajime-chan was born.

307
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I don't remember anything.

308
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I'm just laughing at the atmosphere.

309
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I don't know.

310
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I really took off my contact lenses and bled.

311
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I don't know.

312
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Yesterday, I was doing a skit.

313
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
And I saw your face up close.

314
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
And I was surprised.

315
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Your face was like this.

316
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Like this, right?

317
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
What's with that face?

318
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
It's scary to do something like that.

319
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
It's scary.

320
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
One morning, I woke up and looked in the mirror.

321
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
And I was like, why am I eating candy in the morning?

322
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Stop it.

323
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
It's because you're sleepy.

324
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Ah, ah, ah, ah.

325
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
That's how I am.

326
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I have a lot of sick days.

327
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I suddenly got sick on New Year's Day.

328
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
That's not sick.

329
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
That's not sick.

330
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
There's a cause.

331
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
No, if you say that, I'll get sick again.

332
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I'm sick, so I said, I'm going home.

333
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
And I got a macaroon.

334
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Macaroon is a cut and a scratch.

335
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Well, try it.

336
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I gave it a try, and I got a macaroon.

337
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
And I got sick.

338
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I'm sick of the president.

339
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
You're running fast.

340
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I'm running fast with that.

341
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I'm sick too.

342
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I'm sick.

343
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
That's enough.

344
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Why are you doing that?

345
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I don't want to run fast.

346
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
And the doctor said,

347
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I'm sick.

348
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I was really scared.

349
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I don't know if he's just keeping quiet.

350
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I don't know if he's crying right now.

351
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I don't know if he's telling the truth.

352
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
And then...

353
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
What?

354
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Mr. Matsumoto of Arishihino.

355
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
What month and what day was this recorded?

356
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I'm used to reading books.

357
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
The doctor said,

358
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I don't know.

359
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I'm scared.

360
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Don't say that.

361
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I'm going to watch the movie.

362
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
If you say that,

363
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
you'll come here next time.

364
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Why?

365
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
You're here.

366
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Why are you here?

367
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
You're in the same team as me.

368
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
And then...

369
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
When I went to the hospital,

370
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I was so worried.

371
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
There were about five young nurses.

372
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
They were like,

373
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I'm here.

374
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
They were waiting for me.

375
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
They were like,

376
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I'm here.

377
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
They were waiting for me.

378
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I think they decided to do a rock-paper-scissors.

379
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
The first place winner.

380
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
They said,

381
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
You're lucky.

382
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I was like,

383
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
You're going to be a morogami.

384
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
They said,

385
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
You're going to shake your hand.

386
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
That's how it is.

387
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I was like,

388
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I'm going to be a morogami.

389
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
They were like,

390
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I'm going to shake my hand.

391
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Really?

392
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Really?

393
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
They were shaking their hand like this?

394
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
They were shaking my hand.

395
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
That's so young.

396
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
What if something happened?

397
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I'm so angry.

398
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I'm not a morogami.

399
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I'm not a morogami.

400
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I'm not a morogami.

401
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I'm not a morogami.

402
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
The result was,

403
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I'm not a morogami.

404
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I'm not a morogami.

405
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I'm not a morogami.

406
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I'm not a morogami.

407
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
They said,

408
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
You're not a morogami.

409
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
You're not a morogami.

410
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I know that.

411
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Why are you just saying that?

412
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
You're not a morogami.

413
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
You know that.

414
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
What did you say?

415
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I don't know.

416
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
From Hakata?

417
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I came from Hakata.

418
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Hakata's food store.

419
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
It's a business point!

420
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Matsumoto-san, you're going to be 20 soon.

421
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
What will you do when you're 20?

422
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
This is...

423
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Hey, wait!

424
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
What do you mean, what do you mean?

425
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
You're the same age as me and Sawako!

426
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Ah, back then?

427
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
No, back then!

428
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Why can't you do a lot of things?

429
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I'm really looking forward to it.

430
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Do you call it puberty?

431
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Because you're 20?

432
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
You're still saying that.

433
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
But this is a strange thing.

434
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I thought it would be a little more real, but it's not surprising.

435
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Who's the normal commentator?

436
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Matsumoto-san used to be in the O.L.

437
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,000
If there's bullying from your boss or senpai, please tell me.

438
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I can't remember.

439
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Hey, wait!

440
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:54,000
You're 19 now, right?

441
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,000
You can be over 18 or 16.

442
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
That's right!

443
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Right after high school, I went out of the office.

444
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
What?

445
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I went out and in.

446
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Why?

447
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
It didn't continue.

448
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I went out of the office.

449
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I didn't like that.

450
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Who did you get bullied by?

451
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
The Kaminari president.

452
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
You're a scary president!

453
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
He was very angry with me.

454
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Because you're bad, right?

455
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
You were making mistakes, right?

456
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Yes, about the bamboo skirt.

457
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Did you say it like this?

458
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
It's in the O.L.

459
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
It's in the O.L.

460
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,000
It's in the O.L., so it's not in the O.L.

461
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I was bullied by my colleague.

462
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Matsuura-san?

463
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Who?

464
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Who?

465
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
He's not my colleague.

466
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Matsuura-san?

467
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Yes, Matsuura-san.

468
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Matsuura-san?

469
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
He's not your colleague?

470
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I cried under the desk with Matsuura-san.

471
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Because you were angry?

472
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
No, not because I was angry.

473
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I cried under the desk.

474
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Under the desk...

475
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
That's why...

476
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:28,000
It's not a joke.

477
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Matsumoto-san seems to be in a long-distance relationship.

478
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Where does your girlfriend live?

479
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
She's from Rio.

480
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Rio?

481
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Brazil?

482
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Brazil, Brazil.

483
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
What kind of person is she?

484
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,000
She's Indian.

485
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Are you stupid?

486
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
So what?

487
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Indians shouldn't go to Brazil.

488
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
There's nothing wrong with that.

489
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Don't look down on my girlfriend.

490
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
You're too fast.

491
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I went from India to Brazil.

492
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
They said the curry was spicy.

493
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
It's the taste of a foreign country.

494
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
It can't be spicy.

495
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
So I went.

496
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
You couldn't do it.

497
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I couldn't do it.

498
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
It was too spicy.

499
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I lived in Rio.

500
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
My girlfriend lives over there.

501
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:32,000
It's none of your business.

502
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
What are you talking about?

503
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,000
What was your first impression of Matsumoto-san?

504
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I was attracted to Samba-san.

505
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:48,000
You were attracted to her?

506
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
You were just born.

507
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Why were you attracted to Samba-san?

508
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
I felt sorry for her.

509
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
You were just born.

510
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Why were you attracted to Samba-san?

511
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I was attracted to Samba-san right after I was born.

512
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
You were attracted to Samba-san.

513
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
That's right.

514
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
So?

515
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
When I first saw Matsumoto-san, I thought,

516
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:19,000
she's like Niel-DK.

517
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,000
She's like Minami-Muki.

518
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:30,000
That's really funny.

519
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
I see.

520
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
That's what I thought at first.

521
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
That's what I thought at first.

522
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:40,000
I saw Madori right away.

523
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Where did you see her?

524
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I don't know if she's Niel-DK or not.

525
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
I don't know if she's Niel-DK or not.

526
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
I saw her right away.

527
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:51,000
I thought she was Niel-DK.

528
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:58,000
I thought she was Niel-DK.

529
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Matsumoto-san, I have a question.

530
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
The mole under your eye is called a crybaby.

531
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,000
What is the mole above your eye?

532
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:17,000
The mole above my eye is called a crybaby.

533
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:22,000
That's too easy.

534
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
There's no mole above my eye.

535
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
What?

536
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Did you think the mole was a crybaby?

537
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
You're stupid.

538
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
I didn't think it was a mole.

539
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
That's how it is, everyone.

540
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Everyone is the same.

541
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Do you know what a crybaby is?

542
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Do you know what a crybaby is?

543
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
No.

544
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:51,000
It's easy to make a crybaby.

545
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Is that right?

546
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
It's called a talkbaby.

547
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
People who have mole there talk a lot.

548
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Really?

549
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Yes.

550
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
People who cry a lot get a crybaby.

551
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,000
People who laugh a lot are called upper there.

552
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:11,000
People who laugh a lot are called upper there.

553
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
You have to talk about upper there, don't you?

554
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Some people cry a lot...

555
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Some people cry a lot.

556
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Some people cry a lot, some laugh a lot, some get angry a lot...

557
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
There are a lot, right?

558
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Some people cry a lot.

559
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
The person who cries a lot, is the boss.

560
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
And you cry more than that person?

561
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
It's not like that!

562
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
It's not what you think it is!

563
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
The person who cries a lot is the boss, right?

564
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
That's not what it is!

565
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
It's above the one who cries the most.

566
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
It's above the one who cries the most.

567
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
No!

568
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
It's completely different.

569
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
If it's a simple solution, then what does it mean?

570
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
You don't need to solve it.

571
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
But there's nothing in this.

572
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
So, even if it's above the one who cries the most,

573
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
it's not below the one who cries the most.

574
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
It's above the one who cries the most.

575
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
I don't get it.

576
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
What do you mean by above?

577
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:19,000
So, it's above the one who cries the most!

578
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
What are you talking about?

579
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
But, that's...

580
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
It's below! It's above!

581
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Hey!

582
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
No, it's above.

583
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
It's above.

584
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
It's above the one who cries the most.

585
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
What are you talking about?

586
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
I don't get it.

587
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
You!

588
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
I don't get it.

589
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
You!

590
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Die!

591
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
You die!

592
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Be more proud of yourself!

593
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Be more proud of yourself!

594
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
You die at the top!

595
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Be proud of yourself!

596
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Be proud of yourself at the top!

597
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Emergency!

598
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,000
A child's use, a long-awaited video creation.

599
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
The masterpiece of Mamoru-shu.

600
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
The perfect uncut version of that famous scene.

601
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
On sale to great acclaim.

602
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000

603
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:36,000
