1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The Heipo of the world, Saito Toshihiko

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
A man of miracle who went up to the chief director of Gaki no Tsukai

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
The first opponent is the popular idol, Amihama Naoto

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
The Heipo who was able to be alone with a personality problem

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
It was thought to be a happy goal

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Amihama's passionate declaration

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
The Heipo of the world, the second time in a row

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Mr. Ochi, you came again

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
It's been a long time

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
It's not something I do twice

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I was about to do well

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The next day or the next day's newspaper

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I was already engaged

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I was surprised

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
The girl I brought today

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Please

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
If you don't have more fun, the girl

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
There are various specialties today

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I'm telling you to take out everything you have

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
If you don't do that, you won't have fun

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Please introduce the boy

22
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Bon

23
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
This is my Aho Bon

24
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
It's been a long time

25
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Saito Toshihide

26
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Toritsu Mita High School

27
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Where is it?

28
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Toritsu Mita High School

29
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm in college

30
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
In college?

31
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Height 162 cm

32
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I think this is a lie

33
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
This is also perfect

34
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I'm such a Toshihide

35
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Well, today

36
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Here is the girl I prepared

37
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
This is also good

38
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Harakumiko

39
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
The gravure queen Harakumiko

40
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
With her mature adult charm

41
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
A woman who captivates male fans all over the country

42
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
To be honest, it was Amihama last time

43
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
How is it

44
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Which one are you?

45
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Actually, I like Hara-san

46
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I have to send you a signal from here today

47
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
There was a signal last time

48
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I'm shy, so I don't do anything

49
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I did a lot last time

50
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
This time, I'm wearing this shibire fugu

51
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I wear it to my penis

52
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
While I'm talking

53
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Don't be bored

54
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I thought it was like this

55
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Oh, it's him

56
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Who is it?

57
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
It's a secret

58
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
This program is provided by the sponsor you are watching

59
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Don't be nervous

60
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Be calm

61
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Hello

62
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Hello

63
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Please come in

64
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Excuse me

65
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
This is my Kumiko

66
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Nice to meet you

67
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I'm Harakumiko

68
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Nice to meet you

69
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Well, let's do it

70
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Is it in?

71
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Yes

72
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Kumiko, please eat

73
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Thank you

74
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I'm nervous

75
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Wait a minute

76
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Wait a minute, Tojita-san

77
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I came to see Kumiko

78
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
What are you talking about?

79
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
It's better to be a woman

80
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I'm an old lady

81
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Old lady?

82
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Well, let's eat

83
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Thank you

84
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Cheers

85
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Isn't it real?

86
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
When I drink this

87
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
It reminds me of my childhood

88
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
How is Kumiko now?

89
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Don't you have a boyfriend?

90
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Do you have a boyfriend?

91
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
What?

92
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
What are you talking about?

93
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I thought you were talking about a pig

94
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I don't have a boyfriend

95
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
You don't have a boyfriend?

96
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
That's good

97
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Well, let's eat

98
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Kumiko, please drink with me

99
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Please drink with me

100
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I don't drink

101
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I don't drink

102
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
What?

103
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Kumiko is drinking with me

104
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Here you are

105
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Please drink with me

106
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
My taste has changed

107
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Please

108
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
You are a crazy old lady

109
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Toshihide-san is very talented

110
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
He can do a lot of things

111
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I have a lot of things to do

112
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I'll prepare a little

113
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I'm sorry

114
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Excuse me

115
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
You

116
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
You

117
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
You

118
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Are you going home?

119
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Are you stupid?

120
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I want a manly person

121
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
What are you doing?

122
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
What are you doing?

123
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
What are you doing?

124
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
What are you doing?

125
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Toshihide-san

126
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
You are the president of Scoville today

127
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
That's great

128
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
What's wrong with your wife?

129
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
What's wrong with your wife?

130
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
What are we?

131
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
What are we?

132
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I didn't notice

133
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
It has nothing to do with you

134
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
We are in the back room

135
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Let's talk together

136
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I've been a big fan for a long time

137
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I'm sorry

138
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
It's okay

139
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I brought this today

140
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
If you don't mind, I'd like you to sign it

141
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
This again

142
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
This is a photo book

143
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Thank you very much

144
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I don't like this kind of stuff

145
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I have a request

146
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I've been a fan for a long time

147
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I'd be happy if you could dance a song

148
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I'd be happy if you could dance a song

149
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I'd be happy if you could dance a song

150
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
You mean together?

151
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
It's like a team

152
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Heipo-san is dancing

153
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
It's a dance

154
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I can't dance if I don't stand up

155
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I'm sorry

156
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
A little more

157
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
That's good

158
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I'll move a little

159
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Please turn your hand

160
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
That's good

161
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
What are you looking at?

162
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
It was a dream

163
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Just a little more

164
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
What are you looking at?

165
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
It's been a long time since we met

166
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I'd like to give you a present

167
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I have something for you

168
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Thank you very much

169
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
What is it?

170
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
This is a ring

171
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I made it

172
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
What kind of ring is it?

173
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
No way

174
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
It's a present

175
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I can't hold it

176
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I have my own ring

177
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Why?

178
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Thank you

179
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Did you put it there?

180
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I'm not good at shaking

181
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I don't know how to do it

182
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I'm not good at it

183
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I'm good at it

184
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
That's good

185
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I prepared it for you

186
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I gave it to you

187
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I'll make you feel good

188
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I'm not good at it

189
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I'm not good at it

190
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I'm not good at it

191
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Don't step on it

192
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Please lie down here

193
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
It's okay

194
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Can I lie down?

195
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
It's okay

196
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Don't say that

197
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I'll give you a shoulder massage

198
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Let's massage

199
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
It's okay

200
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
That's good

201
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Wow

202
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
That's good

203
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I'll give you a massage

204
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
What are you doing?

205
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
What are you doing?

206
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
You have to apologize

207
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
What are you doing?

208
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
He came here

209
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I wanted to sing

210
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I'm going to stop the song

211
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
It was hard

212
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I thought you were going to sing

213
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I thought you were going to sing

214
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I thought you were going to sing

215
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I'm still in the first place

216
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I don't know

217
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I was really surprised

218
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
That's okay

219
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Listen to me

220
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
There are really ugly men

221
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
There are a lot of them

222
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
No, I have a girl's bag

223
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
She's ugly

224
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
She walks like this

225
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
She's a go-go girl

226
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
The ugly man walks like this

227
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
He opens the door

228
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
He walks like this

229
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
The ugly man walks like this

230
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
He walks like this

231
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I want to say thank you

232
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Thank you for accepting this ugly woman

233
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Don't talk

234
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Hold her tight

235
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I was just looking at her like this

236
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I was happy

237
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
That's good

238
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
It's getting harder to play

239
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Why is that?

240
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I don't like it

241
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I don't like it

242
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I don't like it

243
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Do you know that Matsumoto was arrested?

244
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Yes

245
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
On the radio, Matsumoto was arrested

246
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I'm sorry

247
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
This is so rude

248
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I can't do what I want

249
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
This is the treasure of the country

250
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I've been having a hard time

251
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Really?

252
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I feel sorry for her

253
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
That's what it means

254
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I'm sorry

255
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I'm sorry

256
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I'm sorry

257
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I'm sorry

258
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
What have you been up to lately?

259
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
You haven't been out at all

260
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I haven't been out for two months

261
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I don't know what to say

262
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I don't like it when it's not sunny

263
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
That's right

264
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
The weather is bad

265
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I have something to say

266
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I have something to say

267
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,000
That's a nice bath

268
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Really?

269
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Thank you

270
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Wait

271
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Who are you?

272
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Come here

273
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Don't write it

274
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Don't write it

275
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
What is it?

276
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
If you look for it, you can make a movie

277
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
What are you looking for?

278
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Don't wrap it up

279
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
What are you looking for?

280
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
What?

281
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I've been thinking

282
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Survival

283
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Please do it

284
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Alone

285
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I want to go to a jungle

286
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Go

287
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I'm thinking of survival

288
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I don't have a day off

289
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Let's do it

290
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Thank you

291
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Why are you laughing?

292
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Let's do it

293
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
What is the muscle behind a dog or a cat?

294
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
What is it for?

295
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Please tell us

296
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Isn't it a cushion?

297
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I've heard of it

298
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
It's a cushion

299
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
There are two reasons

300
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:24,000
First, it doesn't hurt when you buy it on the floor

301
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Also, I think the muscle is just sticking out

302
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
That's a big mistake

303
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
It goes like this

304
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
What?

305
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Like this

306
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
It's round

307
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
It's like a roller

308
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Of course

309
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
It goes like this

310
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I've never seen a cat move that fast

311
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
If you hold a dog like this

312
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
It goes like this

313
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
It's like a roller coaster

314
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
It's like a roller coaster

315
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
If you hold it like this

316
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
It goes like this

317
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
It's amazing

318
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
What?

319
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
You can't lie like that

320
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
It's not a cat

321
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
When I was a high school student

322
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I lied to Nagata

323
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I lied that I had a cat

324
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
That's a good word

325
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
That's rude

326
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
It's really rude

327
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I don't lie

328
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
It's a lie

329
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Do you have a strong rock-paper-scissors?

330
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I'm strong but I'm weak

331
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I think I'll never lose

332
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Then try it

333
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
It's fine

334
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
If I win 5 times, there's something

335
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
If there's nothing, I won't move

336
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
What do you mean?

337
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
If there's no reward, I won't do it

338
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I need a lot of power

339
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
You need a lot of power

340
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
What do you mean?

341
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
You wanted to say something

342
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
What do you want?

343
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
200

344
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
200 yen

345
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Don't say that in the bath

346
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Don't say that in the bath

347
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
You should say it

348
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
You should say it

349
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
You should say it between a big bath and a small bath

350
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
You should say it between a big bath and a small bath

351
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I'm tired

352
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Then say it at 100,000 yen

353
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I'll say it

354
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
100,000 yen

355
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Check with Suga

356
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Otherwise I'll give you power

357
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
With Suga?

358
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
You'll definitely lose

359
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Rock, paper, scissors

360
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
When you said rock, I saw all your data

361
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I got it

362
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Rock, paper, scissors

363
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
What was that?

364
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Can you do it like a prank?

365
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Can you do it like a prank?

366
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
First, I can't fly

367
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
First, I can't fly

368
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
First, I can't fly

369
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Nothing will happen

370
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
That's all

371
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,000
If there is a principal like you

372
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Students won't have fun at all

373
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Nothing will happen

374
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
First, can you fly?

375
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Can you fly?

376
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
First, can you fly?

377
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Can you fly anytime?

378
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Can you fly anytime?

379
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Fly

380
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Listen to my story until the end

381
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Listen to my story until the end

382
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
If I fly to the edge of the ground, the water will open

383
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
If I fly to the edge of the ground, the water will open

384
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Fly

385
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
If I fly now, the water will open

386
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
If I fly now, the water will open

387
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
That's good

388
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Are you stupid?

389
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Are you stupid?

390
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,000
What will you do if the water stops?

391
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
That's me

392
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
If I fly, the water will open

393
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
If I fly, the water will open

394
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Of course

395
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:06,000
You fly on the ground to open the water

396
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:12,000
How far can you fly?

397
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Can you fly like this?

398
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
No, more

399
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Like this?

400
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
No, like this?

401
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
No, like this?

402
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Can you put a stick in my hand?

403
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Can you put a stick in my hand?

404
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I can't do it

405
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,000
You fly like this?

406
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
You are stupid

407
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
You fly like this?

408
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
You are stupid

409
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
You fly like this?

410
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
No, like this

411
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
No, like this

412
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I don't understand

413
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I don't understand

414
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
When I want to fly

415
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
I go like this

416
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Last year

417
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Last year?

418
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Last year

419
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I was watching TV at home

420
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
The water was floating

421
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Next is a mountain

422
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
No

423
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
No

424
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Next is a bye-bye game

425
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
What is a bye-bye game?

426
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
How far can you fly?

427
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
You fly like this

428
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
You fly like this

429
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
You fly like this

430
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
You fly like this

431
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Why is it a bye-bye game?

432
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Why is it a bye-bye game?

433
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I don't know. I was surprised at first.

434
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
It's hard when you die.

435
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Why?

436
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
You're not strong.

437
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
My son was flying.

438
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
So your father was flying?

439
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
He found out.

440
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
What are you talking about?

441
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
You talk too much.

442
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:58,000
What are you talking about?

443
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Tell me how to escape when you're in the basement.

444
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Even now, there are machines and things like that, right?

445
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Yes, there are.

446
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
What kind of things are there?

447
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
For example, if you get out of the line, you'll be rich.

448
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I don't think that makes sense.

449
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Really?

450
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
It doesn't make sense.

451
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Why? It makes a lot of noise.

452
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
It makes a lot of noise.

453
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,000
If it makes a lot of noise, you won't be able to hear it.

454
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:26,000
The other day, when I played with Hatsune Miku in the fire...

455
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
It wasn't a fire.

456
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
What are you talking about?

457
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
What was it?

458
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
I got it. It was a thief.

459
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
It was a thief.

460
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Right?

461
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
What was it?

462
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
What? I forgot.

463
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
It's true.

464
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
It's a nose voice.

465
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
The nose won't stop.

466
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Try it.

467
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
It sounds like Dai-chan.

468
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
What are you doing?

469
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I'm really sorry.

470
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
It wasn't this many.

471
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
The man gets even angrier.

472
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:21,000
I was wondering what he was doing.

473
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
He was using a stun gun.

474
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
That's not good.

475
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
It's the opposite effect.

476
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Really?

477
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
If you get a cold, it means you've got a cold.

478
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
No, no, no.

479
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
I wouldn't get up if I got killed.

480
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Please tell me what it's for.

481
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
What?

482
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
The gun.

483
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
It's really good for you.

484
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Really?

485
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
You can use it right after you get home.

486
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Really?

487
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Anyone can use it?

488
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,000
After you get home, the man will attack you.

489
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
You'll be fine today.

490
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
No!

491
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Don't say that!

492
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
You won't be able to break it today.

493
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Oh!

494
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
I'm going to the theater!

495
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,000
If the man attacks you, you won't resist.

496
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
I won't?

497
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
You won't resist.

498
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
What if he takes you and tells you to do this?

499
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I'll tell him to give me the gun.

500
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
What are you talking about?

501
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
I'll answer his needs.

502
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
You can't answer his needs!

503
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
He's not in the theater.

504
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
I'm really sorry.

505
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Today...

506
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
That happens sometimes.

507
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
How did you figure it out?

508
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
It was pretty fast.

509
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
It was fast, right?

510
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
It was pretty quick.

511
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
It was quick, right?

512
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
But it can't be helped.

513
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
It was like a stung by a stun gun.

514
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:12,000
It was too quick!
