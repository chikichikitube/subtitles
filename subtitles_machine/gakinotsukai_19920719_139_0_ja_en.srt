1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
After this, we're going to downtown Gaki no Tsukaya.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Don't do such a bad thing.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
We're going to Gaki no Tsukaya for the second time.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
It's going to be a hot and hot competition.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:22,000
The temperature in this room right now is about 30 degrees Celsius.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
In front of us, we have oden.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
And this is a pot.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm sitting right now, but please put the futon on your knees and open it.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
The kotatsu is also in the switch today.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
And the person who's going to ask me a question today is...

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
An announcer.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Thank you very much.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Thank you very much.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I've been working hard until now.

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I've been working hard on the news.

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
It's a variety show all of a sudden.

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
But the female announcer is eating a lot.

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I see.

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
You're wearing a mask, aren't you?

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Do you like women?

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
It's not good to say it's hot.

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Everyone, let's eat oden.

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Oden?

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
It's not good to eat oden.

25
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
It warms the body.

26
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
It's hot.

27
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
It's not good to be hot.

28
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
It's not good to be hot.

29
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
It's not good to be hot.

30
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
It's not good to be hot.

31
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Now, Noriyaki, please ask a question.

32
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Now, Noriyaki, please ask a question.

33
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
The total population of the country is GNT.

34
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
What is the total population of the country?

35
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Pure GNT.

36
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
That's right.

37
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Noriyaki.

38
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Go ahead.

39
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Number one of B.

40
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Number one of B.

41
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Hot.

42
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
What is this?

43
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Are you ready?

44
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I'm scared.

45
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
What are you doing?

46
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Are you ready?

47
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
It's hot.

48
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
It's not that simple.

49
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Are you ready?

50
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
It's hot.

51
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
It's not good.

52
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
It's not good.

53
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Question for Matsumoto.

54
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
How many people watch TV?

55
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
500,000 people.

56
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
The correct answer is 1 million people.

57
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
You're kidding me!

58
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
It's not a joke!

59
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
That's the hottest one!

60
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
C3

61
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Tatsura

62
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
It's quite hot

63
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
It's the opposite. It's Mayan

64
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
It's the opposite. It's Mayan

65
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Yes

66
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,000
It's the opposite. It's Mayan

67
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
It's the opposite. It's Mayan

68
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
It's the opposite. It's Mayan

69
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
It's the opposite. It's Mayan

70
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Yamamaki-san, please give us the question

71
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Here's the question

72
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Who is the first Zabuton Hakobi?

73
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
It's Matsuzaki Makoto

74
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
The correct answer is

75
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Dokumamushi Sandayu

76
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
The correct answer is B-2

77
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
B-2

78
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
It's you

79
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Idiot!

80
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Matsuzaki-san, your hands are hot!

81
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
It's hot!

82
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
It's hot!

83
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I'm always hot

84
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Like Tetsuya

85
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I can't move my weight

86
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Here's the question for Hamada-san

87
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Who is the shortest Zabuton Hakobi?

88
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Well

89
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Let's answer

90
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Hey!

91
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Hey!

92
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Makoto!

93
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
What?

94
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Why are you laughing?

95
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I'll call you again

96
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Noriyasu-kun, please

97
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
It's a political question again

98
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
You know the weak points

99
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
This time it's America

100
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
What are the two major states in America?

101
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
What are the two major states in America?

102
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Socialist

103
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Socialist?

104
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
It's the Republican Party

105
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I knew it

106
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
D-3

107
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
D-3

108
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
What?

109
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
What is the animal that looks like an elephant in the sea?

110
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
What is the animal that looks like an elephant in the sea?

111
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Let's go

112
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Hey!

113
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Please

114
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
The answer is

115
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
A seiyuchi

116
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
What is the number?

117
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
C-1

118
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
A stuffed animal

119
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Hey, give me a break!

120
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
No way!

121
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I don't like to hold it

122
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I'm Tetsuya

123
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I'm Tetsuya

124
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Put it on

125
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
What?

126
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Here's the question

127
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Where is the famous Aso-san in Aldera?

128
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Kagoshima

129
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
What?

130
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
The answer is

131
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Kumamoto

132
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
D-2

133
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
D-2

134
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
D-2

135
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
What?

136
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
This is not a joke!

137
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Shut up!

138
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
What is this?

139
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I want to cry

140
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I can't move

141
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I can't move

142
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I'm so happy today

143
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I'm so happy today

144
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I'm so happy today

145
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Today, there are many people wearing glasses

146
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Today, there are many people wearing glasses

147
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Isn't it?

148
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I'm curious

149
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
This is like a game

150
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Rui calls Rui

151
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Rui calls Rui

152
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Rui calls Rui

153
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Rui calls Tomo

154
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Well, it's fine

155
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I know you're lying

156
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I'm telling you

157
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
It happened in the song of Yosuke Tarawa

158
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
This is Rui

159
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
It's totally different

160
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
If you wear glasses

161
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
people wearing glasses will appear

162
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Even if you say it's one of the 7 mysteries of the world

163
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
It's really good.

164
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Well, there is such a belief.

165
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
So, in the family, everyone wears glasses.

166
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
There is such a thing, isn't it?

167
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Before, when I was on the Shinkansen,

168
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I had a family of five and everyone wore glasses.

169
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I'm doing this until everyone arrives.

170
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Don't take me away like that.

171
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
If it shakes a little, everyone does this.

172
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
So, when it shakes, I'll do it, I'll do it.

173
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Then, my grandmother said,

174
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Oh, it's Mt. Fuji.

175
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Then, everyone does this.

176
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Don't do this again.

177
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
This is really a strange thing.

178
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Everyone gathers like that.

179
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Are there only fat people?

180
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Fat people are only fat people.

181
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
It's hot.

182
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
What are you going to eat this time?

183
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
That's all he has.

184
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I'm thirsty.

185
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Me too, me too.

186
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Everyone gathers like that.

187
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
One of the fat people,

188
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I don't know what it is,

189
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
A guy like a leader comes out.

190
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
The fat of the leader is hungry.

191
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
If you say that, everyone is hungry.

192
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Everyone is hungry.

193
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Everyone follows that pig.

194
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Everyone, the pig moves.

195
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
This is really,

196
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
It's the law of fate.

197
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Some people are convinced.

198
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
This program,

199
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
What I say,

200
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
First of all, from the head,

201
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
What do you say?

202
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
No, no, no.

203
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
First of all, from the head,

204
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
That's right.

205
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
First of all, from the head,

206
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
It's stupid to deny it.

207
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
These days,

208
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
First of all, what I say,

209
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
It's been denied.

210
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
That's right.

211
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I've been found out.

212
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
My plume has been peeled off.

213
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
That's right.

214
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I'm not a plume.

215
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
No, no, no.

216
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
What you're saying is telling.

217
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
That's right.

218
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Well, certainly, Kimura,

219
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Including you,

220
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I think all humans have a lower IQ than me.

221
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I think so.

222
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I think so.

223
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
If your IQ is low, you can see.

224
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Why are you being told that by someone who can't speak?

225
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
So,

226
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
You can see, you can see, you can see.

227
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Don't say nonsense.

228
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Isn't it strange at that point?

229
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
No, no, it's not.

230
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
When I hear it, I laugh when it's funny.

231
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Of course.

232
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
It's okay if it's just that.

233
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
So there's something like that in there, right?

234
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
What are you doing now?

235
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
That's different.

236
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
No, it's not.

237
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Why are you changing your pose?

238
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
You did this once. Why are you doing this again?

239
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
That's a brother.

240
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Stop it.

241
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
That's different.

242
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I'm a different person.

243
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
A guest.

244
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Really.

245
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Let's do our best today.

246
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
That's right.

247
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
What were you talking about?

248
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
What?

249
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Yes, yes, yes.

250
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
That's what animals do.

251
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
There's a little fish.

252
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
In the sea.

253
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
There's only half of them, but there's a leader.

254
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
That's the one who's fighting.

255
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
That's right.

256
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
When the leader changes his direction,

257
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Everyone follows him.

258
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
That's strange.

259
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I don't know what you decided to be a leader.

260
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I don't know who did what.

261
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I see.

262
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
What did you say at the beginning?

263
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Glasses?

264
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
A group of glasses or a group of fat people.

265
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
What do you mean?

266
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
You're a leader.

267
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
The one who's fatter is a leader.

268
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
That's completely different.

269
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
The one who's wearing thick glasses is a leader.

270
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Glasses group.

271
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
It's absolutely different.

272
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
What do you mean?

273
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Fat and glasses.

274
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I don't know.

275
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Why?

276
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I don't know either.

277
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Then it's different.

278
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
What?

279
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
What?

280
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Are you crazy?

281
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I'm tired today.

282
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I'm more tired than that.

283
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I'm definitely more tired.

284
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I'm just talking like that.

285
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
You're just talking.

286
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I'm not talking.

287
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
You're talking.

288
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
You know what you're talking about.

289
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
You know what you're talking about.

290
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I know.

291
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
What are you doing?

292
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
You're crazy.

293
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
It's our show.

294
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
What are you doing in front of us?

295
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I don't like it.

296
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Is that so?

297
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
That's right.

298
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
It's okay.

299
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I didn't check the audio.

300
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I don't know what kind of story it was yesterday.

301
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I don't know.

302
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I don't know.

303
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
My mystery is getting solved.

304
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Yes.

305
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I was surfing.

306
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I was surfing.

307
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
In the rough waves.

308
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
In the rough waves.

309
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I carried a baby.

310
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I went to the hospital.

311
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
It's a big lie.

312
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I'm talking about that.

313
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I'm talking about that.

314
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I wanted to say.

315
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I talked about a lot of things.

316
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I wanted to say.

317
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I did a mushroom cut.

318
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Is that so?

319
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Yes.

320
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Can you extend it a little?

321
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Once again.

322
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Like a long time ago.

323
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
It was around here.

324
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
It was around here.

325
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
It's like this.

326
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
It was from here.

327
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
It was like a big bond.

328
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
It was like a big bond.

329
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I was popular.

330
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I was popular.

331
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
It was like this.

332
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
It was like this.

333
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I've never seen it.

334
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I've been with you for about 20 years.

335
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I've been with you for about 20 years.

336
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
When you came with me, you always had that kind of hair.

337
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
It was an ordinary head.

338
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
It was never round.

339
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
It was never round.

340
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
It was never round.

341
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Is that a lie?

342
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I've never told a lie.

343
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I've never told a lie.

344
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Don't be ridiculous.

345
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I've never told a lie.

346
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Don't be ridiculous.

347
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
What's this hand?

348
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
You put it out.

349
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I took it.

350
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
No, no.

351
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
It's okay.

352
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
It's true.

353
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
What are we talking about today?

354
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
What?

355
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I'll tell you.

356
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
What?

357
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I'll tell you.

358
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
It's a big era.

359
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
It's a big era.

360
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
You can't wear a yellow T-shirt.

361
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I went to a meeting the other day.

362
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I went to a meeting.

363
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I'm going to wear a yellow T-shirt.

364
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I'm going to wear it.

365
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
But the design has changed.

366
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
But the design has changed.

367
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I don't want to hear that.

368
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
But it's a big era.

369
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
It's a big era.

370
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
What's that?

371
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
What's that?

372
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
What's the position?

373
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I'm the main.

374
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I'm the main.

375
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I'm the main.

376
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Everyone's shaking hands.

377
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Everyone's shaking hands.

378
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Thank you.

379
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Thank you.

380
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
There's a chorus.

381
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
There's a chorus.

382
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
There's a chorus.

383
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Do I have to cry if I wear a yellow T-shirt there?

384
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Do I have to cry if I wear a yellow T-shirt there?

385
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
It's hard.

386
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Nobody's crying.

387
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Nobody's crying.

388
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I don't want to tell that.

389
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Love saves the earth.

390
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Love saves the earth.

391
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,000
You know, even if you say it, even if you say it,

392
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
you get charity from everyone,

393
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
you get charity from everyone,

394
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
you take responsibility for the money you get from everyone,

395
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
where is it?

396
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Cambodia,

397
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
you give it to people like that.

398
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
That's right.

399
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
You, who are the main organizer,

400
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,000
steal women's underwear,

401
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
steal gasoline,

402
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
and become an AV actress.

403
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Can you save them?

404
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Can you see the screen?

405
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Don't ask!

406
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Can you give them love?

407
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Well, you know,

408
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
that kind of talk is fine, it's a lot of work.

409
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Do you want to decide something?

410
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
What?

411
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Something,

412
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
something that only the people who are watching this program can understand in 24 hours.

413
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Keyword?

414
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Keyword.

415
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:10,000
The last one, the biggest loss.

416
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Where is it?

417
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Do you want to go to the Nihon Budokan?

418
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Probably.

419
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Everyone is wearing a yellow T-shirt,

420
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
but one of them is wearing a Piongiji T-shirt.

421
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
What kind of T-shirt is that?

422
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
You wear a Piongiji T-shirt.

423
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I'm wearing a B&B T-shirt.

424
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Piongiji T-shirt,

425
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
well, it might be funny.

426
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
But you can also,

427
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I can also,

428
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
while I'm going out,

429
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
do the gala,

430
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
24 hours gala,

431
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I can do charity.

432
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
You're kidding me!

433
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I mean,

434
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
it's just between us,

435
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
so even if I can do it,

436
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
it's...

437
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

438
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
You're kidding me!

439
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
It's between us.

440
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
If you can do it,

441
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
we can do it together.

442
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Why do you want to do it together?

443
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
It's your personal idea.

444
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Don't say that.

445
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
It's just between us.

446
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I mean,

447
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
this is just a note.

448
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
It's not a note.

449
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

450
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Don't mind it.

451
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I mean,

452
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I think I've talked too much.

453
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

454
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
No, no, no, no, no, no.

455
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
No, no, no, no, no, no.

456
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
It's your opinion.

457
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Yes, yes.

458
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
This is just a joke.

459
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
What?

460
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
It's just a joke.

461
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Today's person is a little...

462
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
It's just a joke.

463
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Question.

464
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Your hair grows wherever you go.

465
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Why do you only grow your side hair halfway?

466
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Please tell me.

467
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Oh, I see.

468
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I've been saying this since I was a young man.

469
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Hair and talent...

470
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Hair and talent are the same.

471
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
What?

472
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
So,

473
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
your side hair is ignored, right?

474
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
That's why it doesn't grow.

475
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
If you cut it,

476
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
what the hell?

477
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
It's so dirty.

478
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
It's so dirty?

479
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Yes, yes, yes.

480
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
So, if you get a haircut,

481
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
you don't lose.

482
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
It grows.

483
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I don't think you should lose.

484
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
It grows.

485
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
But,

486
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
women's hair grows.

487
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Women's hair grows.

488
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Women's hair grows.

489
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
So, if you stop growing your hair,

490
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
it grows without a stopper.

491
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
What?

492
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
What are you talking about?

493
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
It grows without a stopper?

494
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
It grows more and more.

495
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
It's a locale.

496
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
It's a whole thing.

497
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Well, it's a press.

498
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Yes, yes.

499
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
It's a press.

500
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Judy Ong is like that.

501
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
It's wide, though.

502
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
It's wide, though.

503
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
That's right.

504
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
I see.

505
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
It's wide.

506
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
It's wide, though.

507
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
It's a chikun.

508
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Yes.

509
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Hmm?

510
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
What's wrong?

511
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
What's this?

512
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
It's a crotch.

513
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
But you can read it as a chikun.

514
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
I can't.

515
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I'm talking a lot today.

516
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
You talk a lot.

517
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Yes, I talk a lot.

518
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
It's coming to an end.

519
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,500
There are many things in the world that cannot be understood yet.

520
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:29,000
One of the many mysteries is this.

521
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,500
Grandfather, grandfather, you have a long nose.

522
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,500
That's right, mother also has a long nose.

523
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:36,500
What the hell did this lyrics tell us?

524
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,500
Please tell us.

525
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:41,500
That's what you often say.

526
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:45,000
Isn't it that everyone is equal?

527
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,500
Listen to the story of tomorrow.

528
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,500
What is it? Your nose is long!

529
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,500
No!

530
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,500
Listen to the story of tomorrow.

531
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:56,000
In the beginning, before listening to the song,

532
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,500
I have a long nose, so it's disgusting.

533
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,500
Why is my nose so long?

534
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:01,500
What is it?

535
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,500
What is it?

536
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,000
At that time, with this song,

537
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
You are not the only one.

538
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,500
I also have a long nose.

539
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,500
Isn't that the case?

540
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,500
Isn't it the same?

541
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:15,500
That's different.

542
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,500
I thought so.

543
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,000
What do you mean?

544
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,500
This is the old Roman law.

545
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,500
That's enough!

546
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:26,500
That's enough!

547
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,500
That's different.

548
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:31,500
So the frog's child is a frog.

549
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:35,500
If your father is bald, you will also be bald.

550
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:38,500
That's why you look like your father.

551
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:41,000
That's because you are my son.

552
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
You are my son.

553
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,500
I am your mother.

554
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:50,500
It's a song to strengthen the bond of the family.

555
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:53,000
It's the same as what you're saying.

556
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,500
Why?

557
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:55,500
It's completely different.

558
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,500
What you're saying and what I'm saying.

559
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,500
If you have a long nose, I have a long nose.

560
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,500
It's the same as what you're saying.

561
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,500
If you have hair coming out of your ears,

562
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,500
I also have hair coming out of my ears.

563
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:11,500
It's the same.

564
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:16,000
Speak!

565
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,500
It's too early to tell you this story.
