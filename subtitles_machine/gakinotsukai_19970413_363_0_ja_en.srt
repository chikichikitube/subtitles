1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
This is the last round.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
This is the last round.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Today, Makoto looks normal.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
He looks like a convenience store brother.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
He looks like a convenience store brother.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
This time, it is a competition between the Matsumoto team and the Hamada team.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
The team that makes the opponent laugh and gains many points wins.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
And the team is decided.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Rock, paper, scissors.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I won.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I'm sure.

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
My body is facing that direction.

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
If you take that direction, you win.

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Why are you doing that?

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I won.

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
What is the prize?

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
The prize...

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I will go to the medical school.

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I have a prize here.

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I have a prize here.

21
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I have a prize here.

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I really want to go to this campus.

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Next, Makoto is the spring of water.

24
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Hama chose the Oishigoro of the dark horse.

25
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I have a high eye.

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
And Hama chose the Tama of running.

27
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The loser, Makoto, got the Otsuki Oji.

28
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The remaining two are the winner.

29
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Rock, paper, scissors.

30
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm a Toraoda martial artist.

31
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm sure.

32
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm a Toraoda martial artist.

33
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm sure.

34
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm the last one.

35
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
This is difficult.

36
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
This campus is difficult.

37
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I will do my best.

38
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I will do my best.

39
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I won't do anything bad.

40
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:47,000
This program is provided by the sponsor you are watching.

41
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I think this is good.

42
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I think this is good.

43
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm scared.

44
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
And a careful strategy meeting was held with each team.

45
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
It's dirty.

46
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
It's dirty data.

47
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
It's dirty data.

48
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
It's dirty data.

49
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
It's dirty data.

50
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
This is normal data.

51
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
This is normal data.

52
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
There is such a difference in everyday life.

53
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
This is ugly.

54
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
And Hama's team is.

55
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
This is a decision.

56
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I don't know who it is.

57
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
This is a decision.

58
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
This is a decision.

59
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I will start with the team.

60
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I will introduce you.

61
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I will introduce you.

62
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I will introduce you.

63
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I will start with Oda Mudo.

64
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I will introduce you.

65
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I understand.

66
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I understand.

67
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Thank you.

68
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I am confident.

69
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Where did that confidence come from?

70
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Oda Mudo is full of confidence.

71
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
How many points will he get?

72
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Let's go.

73
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
The first round.

74
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Start.

75
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:54,000
The second round.

76
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
The third round.

77
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
The fourth round.

78
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
The fifth round.

79
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
The sixth round.

80
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
The seventh round.

81
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
The eighth round.

82
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
The ninth round.

83
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
The eighth round.

84
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
The ninth round.

85
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I didn't do my best.

86
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
You got one point.

87
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
One point.

88
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
What is the first team?

89
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Who?

90
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Who?

91
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Let's go to the professor.

92
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I understand.

93
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Let's go to Professor Otsuki.

94
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Let's go to the professor.

95
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Machan is doing his best to regain his own defeat.

96
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Can Professor Otsuki respond to that?

97
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Let's go to Professor Otsuki.

98
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Let's do our best.

99
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Don't look away.

100
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
If you look away, you will get one point.

101
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Let's go.

102
00:04:49,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Let's go.

103
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Let's go.

104
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,000
So far, Oishi Goro was laughing.

105
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I think it's okay to judge that I was laughing.

106
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Yamaguchi-san, what do you think?

107
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I wasn't laughing.

108
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
No one?

109
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Zero points?

110
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
No way.

111
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
No way.

112
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
If you think I was laughing,

113
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Haruro sensei was laughing.

114
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Haruro sensei was laughing.

115
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Read it properly.

116
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Haruro sensei was laughing.

117
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Let's go to the second round.

118
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Let's go to the second round.

119
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I would like to send Goro Oishi here.

120
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Thank you.

121
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Let's go.

122
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
The professor was laughing.

123
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
What is the first episode that Oishi Goro shows?

124
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
This is the second round.

125
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Our team is Oishi Goro.

126
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I don't know how it will be.

127
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Good luck.

128
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Look at the center.

129
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Don't look away.

130
00:06:45,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Let's go.

131
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:31,000
It's me.

132
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Why?

133
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Why?

134
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Why?

135
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Why?

136
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Why?

137
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
It's Goro Oishi.

138
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
It's Goro Oishi.

139
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
It's Goro Oishi.

140
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Stop explaining the Odamu-do.

141
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Stop explaining the Odamu-do.

142
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
It's Odamu-do.

143
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
It's Odamu-do.

144
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Yamazaki sensei.

145
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Why do you keep saying that?

146
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
He knows it.

147
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
There is a child who is in a difficult age.

148
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I feel sorry for him.

149
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I feel sorry for him.

150
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I feel sorry for him.

151
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Who is the second team?

152
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Who is the second team?

153
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Let's go to Yoshie.

154
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Let's go to Yoshie.

155
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Let's go to Yoshie.

156
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Don't laugh.

157
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Don't laugh.

158
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
He wants to reduce the distance.

159
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
He wants to reduce the distance.

160
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
He is looking forward to Yoshie.

161
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
There are many things.

162
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Next is a strong opponent.

163
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Next is a strong opponent.

164
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I have a bad feeling.

165
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
That woman is a pot.

166
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Next is a strong opponent.

167
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Next is a strong opponent.

168
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Next is a strong opponent.

169
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Don't drink.

170
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Let's go to Yoshie.

171
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Don't drink.

172
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Don't drink.

173
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
This is bad.

174
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:51,000
This is bad.

175
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
This is bad.

176
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Everyone sujet.

177
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Everyoneற except Mr. Oda.

178
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Everyone except Mr. Oda.

179
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Everyone except Mr. Oda.

180
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
The crushed team owns 4 points.

181
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Don't you know?

182
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I don't know the reason this battery is掉.

183
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
There are three singles over.

184
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
There are three singles over.

185
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
What is Reiwa written on people's drug?

186
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:13,000
What is Reiwa written on people's drug?

187
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
What is Reiwa written on people's drug?

188
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
It's ridiculous.

189
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
It has been reversed.

190
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Let us fight with guts!

191
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Guts Ishimatsu

192
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
If it's like this, it's Guts

193
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Guts Ishimatsu from the Hama-chan team

194
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
He's here

195
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I'm Guts Ishimatsu

196
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
It's funny just by the name

197
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
It's funny just by the way he's sitting

198
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
It's funny just by the way he's sitting

199
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I'll do my best

200
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Let's go

201
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Everyone, look at the center

202
00:10:51,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Guts Ishimatsu

203
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Guts Ishimatsu

204
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Yama-san, look

205
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
This is bad

206
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Shion, you're amazing

207
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Amazing

208
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
It's not funny

209
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
3 points

210
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
It's good

211
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
4 points

212
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Good good good

213
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Shion, you're amazing

214
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
You showed us that

215
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
You did well

216
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
The original one was better

217
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
The 3rd round

218
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I'll go with Makoto

219
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Get ready

220
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Makoto is thinking

221
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Does Makoto have a plan?

222
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
It's a good scenario

223
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I don't know what will happen to Makoto

224
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Really?

225
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Let's do it

226
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Let's go

227
00:12:45,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Makoto is thinking

228
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:16,000
It's good

229
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
1 point

230
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
It's a tie

231
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
That was close

232
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
You're so beautiful

233
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,000
You're so beautiful that I fell for you

234
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
You're so good

235
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
You opened your eyes

236
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I didn't

237
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I was looking at the bird

238
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
You're so good

239
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Makoto

240
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
You're in the way

241
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
You're beautiful

242
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
You're beautiful

243
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
The Tama-chan team is good at looking

244
00:13:53,000 --> 00:14:00,000
They're laughing at the setting

245
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Tama's running

246
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Everyone, look at the center

247
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Let's go

248
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
1 point

249
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
It's a tie

250
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
That was close

251
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
You're so beautiful

252
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
You're beautiful

253
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
You opened your eyes

254
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I didn't

255
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I was looking at the bird

256
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
You're so good

257
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
You opened your eyes

258
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I didn't

259
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I was looking at the bird

260
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
You're beautiful

261
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
You opened your eyes

262
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
You're beautiful

263
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
You opened your eyes

264
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I didn't

265
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I was looking at the bird

266
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
You're beautiful

267
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
You opened your eyes

268
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I didn't

269
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Why did you ask the question?

270
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Why?

271
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I didn't notice you were holding it.

272
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I thought you were holding it.

273
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
It was almost like this.

274
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Ah, ah, ah, hat.

275
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I thought you were okay.

276
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
There is a story.

277
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
It was exactly like that.

278
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
It's a great costume.

279
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Why? It's not funny.

280
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
What do you think?

281
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I said I shouldn't have said it, but I said it to the tank.

282
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
There are many things like that.

283
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I was surprised.

284
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I was surprised.

285
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I was surprised.

286
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,000
What kind of face will that Mizu Haruo make carefully?

287
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
This is the last one.

288
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
This is the last one, right?

289
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Yes.

290
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
This is also good.

291
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Maybe I will get full marks.

292
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I'm not confident about that.

293
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Let's go.

294
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
This is the last one.

295
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:21,000
This is Mizu Haruo.

296
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:48,000
This is the last one.

297
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I'm sorry.

298
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
There is a story.

299
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
It's not funny.

300
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
You look like a delayed alien.

301
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
The camera is broken.

302
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
It's hot.

303
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I didn't see it.

304
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
How many points did you get?

305
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Hamada and Gatsu got 3 points.

306
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Did you get 100 points?

307
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I got 100 points.

308
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I'm sorry.

309
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I can't help it.

310
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I can't help it.

311
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I was surprised.

312
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
There is one more round.

313
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Let's play one more round.

314
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I wanted to make Hamada laugh.

315
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Hamada's face was amazing.

316
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,000
His face was funny.

317
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I will play the last round.

318
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I will play Gatsu.

319
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I will play Gatsu.

320
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I can't help it.

321
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
The Hamachan team is aiming for a comeback.

322
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
They play Gatsu.

323
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Are you okay?

324
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I'm okay.

325
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
I don't want to fight.

326
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Why?

327
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I want to laugh.

328
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Let's go.

329
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Look at the center.

330
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:22,000
The Hamachan team is aiming for a comeback.

331
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:36,000
The Hamachan team is aiming for a comeback.

332
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:56,000
The Hamachan team is aiming for a comeback.

333
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:06,000
The Hamachan team is aiming for a comeback.

334
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Don't make a funny face.

335
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Yamazaki's score is 3 points.

336
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I'm sorry.

337
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Don't make a funny face.

338
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Don't make a funny face.

339
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
The Hamachan team is 0 points.

340
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
The Hamachan team is 0 points.

341
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
I understand.

342
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Who will you send to the final round?

343
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I have to decide at the end.

344
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I will send Yoshihiro Yoshida.

345
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I will send Yoshihiro Yoshida to the final round.

346
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
The Hamachan team is Yoshihiro Yoshida.

347
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Who will be the winner?

348
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:03,000
The staff are very good.

349
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I heard that.

350
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
The staff are very good.

351
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I can't use my weapon.

352
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I can't use my weapon.

353
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I can't use my weapon.

354
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
This is the final round.

355
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I will send Yoshihiro Yoshida.

356
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:53,000
I will send Yoshihiro Yoshida to the final round.

357
00:20:53,000 --> 00:21:17,000
I will send Yoshihiro Yoshida to the final round.

358
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Who will be the winner?

359
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:24,000
I won.

360
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
I protected you.

361
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Everyone was angry.

362
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I laughed at Yoshihiro Yoshida.

363
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
I protected you.

364
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
I was patient.

365
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I was about to cry.

366
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,000
It was a great battle.

367
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:49,000
The Hamachan team won by 10 to 9.

368
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,000
It was a great battle.

369
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
It was very interesting.

370
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Let's do it again.

371
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
I won't laugh no matter how many times I do it.

372
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
This is a great battle.

373
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
This is a great battle.

374
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I won't laugh.

375
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Did you see yourself in the mirror?

376
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:43,000
