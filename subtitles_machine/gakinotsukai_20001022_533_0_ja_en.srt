1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
This time, Gaki no Tsukai is...

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
It's the last time! It's the last time!

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
If you say that, I'll punch you in the face!

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Every time, the recording time is longer than one hour.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
It doesn't stop at the broadcast time.

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
We couldn't show you until yesterday.

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Bakushou Hizoutoukyou.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
It's a big release!

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Laugh as much as you want.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Please forget all the bad things.

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Gaki no Tsukai Hizoutoukyou

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Laugh as much as you want.

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Please forget all the bad things.

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
This program is brought to you by the sponsors you see.

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Gaki no Tsukai

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
What are you talking about?

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
The Olympics, the Olympics.

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
It's so noisy.

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
What is that?

20
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I'm not interested in it.

21
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
You're not interested, are you?

22
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
You're not, are you?

23
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
But...

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Wait a minute.

25
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
This is bad.

26
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
What?

27
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
You're shaking your head like this.

28
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
In the middle, it's like this.

29
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
It's like this.

30
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Is that so?

31
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Are you looking forward to the Olympics?

32
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Somehow,

33
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
You say that once every four years.

34
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
That's a lie, isn't it?

35
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Why?

36
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
It's not a birthday party for Hikaru Nishida.

37
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
It's obviously too early for me.

38
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Isn't that strange?

39
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
No, it's okay.

40
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'll do it properly.

41
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Is that so?

42
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I don't know.

43
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I don't know who's in it.

44
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Is that so?

45
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I only know Yawara-chan.

46
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Yawara-chan is still annoying.

47
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:59,000
You can be sued again.

48
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Wait a minute.

49
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
What do you mean again?

50
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I've been sued once.

51
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Again?

52
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Actually,

53
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I found out a little while ago.

54
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
When I heard about Yawara-chan,

55
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I became a huge fan of downtown.

56
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I heard about it.

57
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
It's a rumor.

58
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I don't know if it's true or not.

59
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Apparently,

60
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Everyone was looking forward to it.

61
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
The two of them became ugly together.

62
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
If it's Yawara-chan,

63
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I can't stand it anymore.

64
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I can't stand it anymore.

65
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I can't stand it anymore.

66
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
This is...

67
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I think it's pitiful.

68
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
It's funny.

69
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Everyone was looking forward to it.

70
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
If it's Yawara-chan,

71
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
The two of them became ugly together.

72
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
If it's Yawara-chan,

73
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I can't stand it anymore.

74
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I'm sorry.

75
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I'm sorry.

76
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I've heard about it before.

77
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Is that so?

78
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Is that so?

79
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I can't stand it anymore.

80
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
You've grown up recently.

81
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Your face is...

82
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
To put it bluntly,

83
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Sexy.

84
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Right?

85
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I don't think so.

86
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I thought,

87
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Kawasaki has grown up.

88
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
When he was doing this group,

89
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
He was like,

90
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I don't have any white hair.

91
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
He was like,

92
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I have a gold hair.

93
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
That's what I meant.

94
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I have a gold hair.

95
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I want to say,

96
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I don't have any white hair.

97
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
To put it bluntly,

98
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Sexy.

99
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
You don't have to say that.

100
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Other than Pyonkichi-kun,

101
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I've heard that there are flat-faced animals.

102
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Yes, yes, yes.

103
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Matsumoto-san,

104
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
You're wearing a T-shirt today.

105
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
What are those flat-faced animals?

106
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
You're wearing a T-shirt like that today?

107
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I'm wearing it.

108
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I have a lot of flat-faced T-shirts.

109
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
You only have one?

110
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Yes.

111
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Why don't you show me once?

112
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I don't know if you'll be surprised.

113
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I'll be surprised.

114
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I have a lot of them.

115
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Really?

116
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
The one I'm wearing today is a snake.

117
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
A snake?

118
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
It's a snake-flat-faced T-shirt.

119
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Why did that happen?

120
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I made a mistake.

121
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
A snake-flat-faced T-shirt.

122
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Normally, it's like this.

123
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Yes, yes, yes.

124
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I thought it was vertical.

125
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Vertical?

126
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Like this.

127
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Eh?

128
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Where was this?

129
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
What kind of situation was this?

130
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I thought it was vertical.

131
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
It was strange when we bumped into each other, right?

132
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
At the camp.

133
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
At the camp.

134
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I was going to the camp and the snake was rolling down the slope.

135
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I was screaming like this.

136
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
When the snake roared,

137
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
It rolled down the slope.

138
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,000
So the snake's face was facing forward.

139
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I could only see the side of the snake.

140
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
It was crouched.

141
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
It was crouched.

142
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
So I couldn't tell the snake from its face.

143
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
You couldn't tell?

144
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
That's right.

145
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
So this was...

146
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
And it was a little off to the side.

147
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I thought it was facing forward,

148
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
but normally you don't go in the middle like that.

149
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
So it was a little off, and the face was facing this way.

150
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I thought it was coming this way.

151
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
It wasn't funny.

152
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I couldn't tell.

153
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
No, that's not good.

154
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
So I was in trouble.

155
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
So besides the snake, what else?

156
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
You have a lot, right?

157
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I have a lot.

158
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Other than snakes?

159
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Yes, snakes.

160
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I have a frog, though.

161
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Oh, really?

162
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Yes.

163
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Like Pyongji.

164
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I have one like Pyongji.

165
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I have one like Pyongji.

166
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
It's attached to the back.

167
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Over here.

168
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
It's attached to the back.

169
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I can't see it. It's always sticking out here.

170
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
It's like a pig.

171
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
You see,

172
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
it's attached to the back.

173
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Taku isn't on it that much either.

174
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
It doesn't seem like it hurts when a sea turtle sheds tears,

175
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
so why do you shed tears?

176
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Sea turtles are often asked about this.

177
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
But there are videos like that too.

178
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Yes, there are.

179
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
They say they cry and cry.

180
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
My mother used to say that a lot.

181
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Look at that.

182
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Look at that.

183
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
She used to say that when she saw a kingdom of the wild.

184
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
That's so nostalgic.

185
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Yes, she used to say that.

186
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
It doesn't hurt, does it?

187
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
A sea turtle doesn't hurt.

188
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Oh, really?

189
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Because that kind of thing doesn't have a lot of nerves.

190
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
That's not true.

191
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
No, it's true.

192
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Even if it's a fish,

193
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
when it's put down on the sand, it can't do anything.

194
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
What?

195
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Pain is a human feeling.

196
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Even if you cut down a fish,

197
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
it won't hurt.

198
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
It won't hurt at all.

199
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
It's just that it's surprised by the situation.

200
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
The knife comes in,

201
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
it doesn't hurt.

202
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
It's just that it's going,

203
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
So it's just bouncing?

204
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
It's just bouncing.

205
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
It's just that it's going,

206
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
and that's all.

207
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Is that so?

208
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Yes.

209
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
A fish that hurts like that,

210
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
that's just a premonition.

211
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
That's a little strange.

212
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I don't know why you like that.

213
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Why are you crying?

214
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Why? Do you want to know?

215
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
It's not because it hurts, right?

216
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Then what do you think it is?

217
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
That's why I'm asking.

218
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I thought it would hurt, but it doesn't hurt.

219
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Then you can think of it as a human woman.

220
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
What do you mean?

221
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Let's say a human woman is giving birth to a baby while crying.

222
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,000
If the doctor says, do your best, and the baby is crying, why is that?

223
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
If a human woman were to cry, what would happen?

224
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
In that sense, a human and a god are the same.

225
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Why is it so quiet?

226
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I'm the only one who's talking.

227
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
That's the way it is now.

228
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Why are you crying when it doesn't hurt?

229
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
You can tell me that.

230
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
There are many theories.

231
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Really?

232
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
There are 8 theories.

233
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
You said it yourself.

234
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
8?

235
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Yes, there are about 8 theories.

236
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:38,000
One of them is that it's not the child of the person you like.

237
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
What if it's all true?

238
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
What about the god of the sea?

239
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
The god of the sea doesn't fall in love, right?

240
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I don't know that.

241
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Do you think the god of the sea would fall in love?

242
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Then why would he lay eggs?

243
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
That's why the god of the sea isn't love.

244
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,000
It's more of a match made in heaven.

245
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
It's a forced marriage made in heaven.

246
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
But because it doesn't go against the will of the god of the sea,

247
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
the god of the sea will do whatever the god of the sea wants.

248
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
But he won't call.

249
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
He'll just do it.

250
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
He'll just do it.

251
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
He'll just run away.

252
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
He's a bad guy.

253
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
That's right. The god of the sea isn't a bad guy.

254
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
He'll say, I like you, I like you.

255
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Why are you saying it twice?

256
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
He'll say, let's do it together.

257
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
He'll say, I'll call you again.

258
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
But he'll never call again.

259
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
What are you doing?

260
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
What are you doing?

261
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
What are you doing?

262
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:44,000
He'll say, I'll close the door.

263
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Aoyama.

264
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Aoyama.

265
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Right?

266
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
He'll say, I was just playing around.

267
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
He'll be surprised.

268
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
He'll be surprised.

269
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
That's strange.

270
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
He'll throw up.

271
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
He'll throw up.

272
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
He'll go to the hospital.

273
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
He'll go to the hospital and check if it's true.

274
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
He'll go to the hospital and check if it's true.

275
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
That's it.

276
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
That's it.

277
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Right?

278
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
He'll realize it.

279
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
He'll realize it.

280
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
That's why he'll run away.

281
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
He'll run away.

282
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I don't know.

283
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I want to go to the beach.

284
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Women like sour food.

285
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Men don't.

286
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I want to go to the beach.

287
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Then he'll run away?

288
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Yes, he'll run away.

289
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
He won't look and place box.

290
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
It's not that he's a man she likes!

291
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
It's not that he's a man she likes!

292
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
And then she'll cry for him.

293
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
And he'll cry?

294
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
And then she'll cry.

295
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
A Beautiful Girl

296
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Let's see...

297
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
This is a good one out of the 8.

298
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I'll just end it here.

299
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
The skin of the head...

300
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
The skin of the head, even if you pinch it, it doesn't hurt that much.

301
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
This is one of your tricks!

302
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
And by the way, ask the guy next to you!

303
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Don't ask me!

304
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
It can't be helped.

305
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
You're such an idiot.

306
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
It depends on how you feel about it.

307
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
It might be hard for a woman to understand.

308
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
You're probably thinking, is that so?

309
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
And here too, right?

310
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Ah, here?

311
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Here too, right?

312
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
It's pretty close to here.

313
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
But if you pinch it, it hurts, right?

314
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
What do you mean?

315
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
If you pinch it, it hurts a little, right?

316
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Does it hurt here?

317
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
If you pinch it...

318
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
No, it doesn't hurt at all.

319
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
If you pinch it yourself, it doesn't hurt.

320
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
What?

321
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
It hurts.

322
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
If you pinch it...

323
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Take out the skin.

324
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
If you pinch it, you'll get caught!

325
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I don't like it!

326
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
You're making me sadistic!

327
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I know!

328
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I can see it!

329
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I'm scared of the pain!

330
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I hate it!

331
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
When I go home and take a shower,

332
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
my skin turns blue!

333
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I'm the one who got hit by Hamada!

334
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
My skin turns blue after I go home!

335
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I know!

336
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
But I can understand it myself.

337
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
If you pinch it, it hurts.

338
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
That's true.

339
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
So what is it?

340
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I want you to tell me why it doesn't hurt.

341
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Ah, then...

342
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I don't know!

343
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
What do you think?

344
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Please tell me.

345
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I think it hurts.

346
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
What are you doing?

347
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I'm doing it, but it hurts.

348
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
It hurts!

349
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
It doesn't hurt.

350
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
It hurts!

351
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
It doesn't hurt!

352
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Then, pinch it!

353
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Then, pinch it yourself!

354
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
It hurts!

355
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
It doesn't hurt!

356
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
If you pinch it like this...

357
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
If you roll it, it doesn't hurt!

358
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Then, pinch it!

359
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
If you roll it, it doesn't hurt!

360
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
If you roll it, it doesn't hurt!

361
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
If you roll it, it doesn't hurt!

362
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
It doesn't hurt?

363
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
No, but...

364
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Then, pinch it like this.

365
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
That's right.

366
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Then, pinch it.

367
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Then, pinch it.

368
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Then, pinch it.

369
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Then, pinch it.

370
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I don't like it anymore.

371
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:21,000
The legend of the flying body from the Tokyo Tower without any equipment.

372
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Please tell me again the legend of the flying body from the Tokyo Tower without any equipment.

373
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Ah, that's how it went.

374
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
It's an old, good era.

375
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Does it have anything to do with that?

376
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
It's from the 70's.

377
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Ah, you're blushing.

378
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Yes, it does.

379
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
What does this mean?

380
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
What is it?

381
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Why?

382
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
A movie?

383
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
A movie.

384
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
A movie?

385
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Yes.

386
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
What kind of role did you play?

387
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
What kind of role?

388
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
What kind of role?

389
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
What scene?

390
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
The detective.

391
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
The detective from the Tokyo Tower?

392
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
He's dead.

393
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
This is...

394
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
The detective.

395
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I told him to spare me.

396
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I told him to spare me.

397
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
But the director said,

398
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,000
This is something only you can do.

399
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I want you to do it.

400
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
From where?

401
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
From the Tokyo Tower.

402
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
From where?

403
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
From where?

404
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
From the top.

405
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
What do you mean the top?

406
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
The top?

407
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
The highest point.

408
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
The highest point.

409
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
The highest point.

410
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
The highest point?

411
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
What do you mean the highest point?

412
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
The highest point.

413
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
The highest point?

414
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
It's hard to go up there.

415
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Yes.

416
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
What?

417
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I climbed up there on a crane.

418
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
A crane?

419
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Up there?

420
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
There's no crane like that.

421
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I was surprised when I went up there.

422
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
What was surprising?

423
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
It was very sharp.

424
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
What?

425
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I was sharp back then.

426
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
That doesn't matter.

427
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
What's that?

428
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I was holding a stick.

429
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
What?

430
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I was holding a stick.

431
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
How did I do it?

432
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
What kind of state were you waiting for?

433
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
For that stick?

434
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
You have to hold it like this

435
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
It's amazing

436
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
The wind is so strong

437
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
And then?

438
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
And then you go like this

439
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
You went backwards?

440
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
That was scary

441
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
No, I don't get it

442
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
That's a movie, right?

443
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
It's a movie

444
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
It's a detective

445
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
That detective

446
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Why did he climb all the way up

447
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
And fall down like that?

448
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Please watch the movie

449
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I don't know if it's on video

450
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
That detective

451
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Is it a suicide scene?

452
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
What?

453
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Is it a suicide scene?

454
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
What?

455
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
What is that?

456
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Is it a suicide scene?

457
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
What?

458
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Is it a suicide scene?

459
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
No, it's not

460
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Why did that detective have to jump?

461
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Tell me about it

462
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
You're so complicated

463
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
It's not funny at all

464
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
He found the culprit

465
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I don't get it

466
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
He was looking at the culprit from above

467
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
And he was like, that's it!

468
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
And then he fell down

469
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
What are you going to do?

470
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
You're going to die

471
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
But

472
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
It's a strange story

473
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
The more he changed his life

474
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
The more he was chasing the culprit

475
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I understand how you feel

476
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
There's no continuation to the story

477
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
He's already dead

478
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
The end

479
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
What a strange movie

480
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
What is that?

481
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Is that the end?

482
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
It's the end

483
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
There were only a few actors

484
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I was surprised

485
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
But you were okay

486
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Because it was a stunt

487
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
You were the stunt for that role, right?

488
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
That's right

489
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
You didn't put anything on

490
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I didn't put anything on

491
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
What happened?

492
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I just fell down

493
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
It hurt so much

494
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
That's not true

495
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
What do you mean it hurt so much?

496
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I fell from the top of the Tokyo Tower

497
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Have you ever been to the Tokyo Tower?

498
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
It's made of concrete

499
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I fell down there

500
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
It hurt so much

501
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
It hurt so much

502
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Where did you fall down from?

503
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
From the top of the Tokyo Tower

504
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
How did you fall down?

505
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I just fell down

506
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
You didn't even change your weapon

507
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
You just fell down

508
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
If you were that far away, you wouldn't be able to do this

509
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Your head is heavy

510
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
You wouldn't be able to do this

511
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
It wasn't like that

512
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Really

513
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I just fell down

514
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
It hurt so much

515
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
It hurts

516
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
The makeup artist came to me and said

517
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Are you okay?

518
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
It hurts

519
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Where does it hurt?

520
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Where does it hurt?

521
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
It hurts

522
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,000
In the end, I went to the sushi restaurant

523
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
In the end, I went to the sushi restaurant

524
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I heard that you haven't found a cure for water bugs yet

525
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I heard that you have a cure for water bugs at the convenience store

526
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I heard that you have a cure for water bugs at the convenience store

527
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
What should we do to cure it?

528
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I have a cure for it

529
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
You have a cure for it at the convenience store?

530
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I did it at the convenience store

531
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
A German professor told me

532
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
You are such a fool

533
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Really?

534
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Really?

535
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
What did he tell you to cure it with?

536
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
At the convenience store

537
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
At the convenience store

538
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
There is a safe

539
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
There is

540
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
You can put in 1 yen coins or 5 yen coins

541
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
At that place

542
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
At that place

543
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
At the foot

544
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:19,000
At the foot

545
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,000
The skin will go in

546
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
The skin will go in

547
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I see

548
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
I am a sexy man

549
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
I am a sexy man

550
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Since Marilyn Monroe's Monroe Walk

551
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Sexy walking has not been born in the world

552
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Please teach me the new sexy walk of the 21st century

553
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,000
But it may be true

554
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
What are you talking about?

555
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Speaking of which, that may have been the best

556
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Recently, there are some Japanese women who say that their proportions have improved

557
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Right?

558
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:11,000
But there are not many people who walk in such a sexy way

559
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
What do you mean?

560
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Like Marilyn Monroe

561
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Do you know how to walk in such a sexy way?

562
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I have never seen it

563
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Monroe Walk is just the way Monroe walks

564
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
It is not a special way of walking

565
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,000
But this is Monroe Walk

566
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Since then, it has not been born

567
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Please teach me the new sexy walk

568
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
All right

569
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Please teach me

570
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Oh, my disciple, take it

571
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
He is not here

572
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:08,000
It is a sexier way of walking than Monroe Walk

573
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
In the 21st century

574
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:15,000
To be honest, it may be hurtful for women to say this

575
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
But there are still some women who walk in such a sexy way

576
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Right?

577
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Right now, there are some women who walk in such a sexy way

578
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
There are some women who walk in such a sexy way

579
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Why do I get a phone call from the country and from the countryside?

580
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Oh, from the countryside? Oh, I was surprised

581
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I want to see my grandchild

582
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I want to hear a good story

583
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
You are the one who is being told that

584
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
They may come

585
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I get a bit nervous

586
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
I get a bit nervous

587
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
But I don't want to have a blind date

588
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I want to have a love affair

589
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
There are some people who are worried about it

590
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Among the guests today

591
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Oh, there are

592
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
They come out and I am one of them

593
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
It is a sexier way of walking

594
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
The way of walking is different?

595
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Yes

596
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Then, please tell me

597
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
What will happen if you do that?

598
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
What will happen if you do that?

599
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
There are two men and three women

600
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Just by walking like that?

601
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,000
There are two men and three women in a group of four

602
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
It is complicated

603
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
It is complicated

604
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
You are the only one

605
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:41,000
One of them is coming

606
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
What is it?

607
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Just walk

608
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Why are you leaving?

609
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:13,000
What is it?

610
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Just walk

611
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Why are you walking like this?

612
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Like this

613
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Well

614
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
I got a bit

615
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
I can't do this

616
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
I thought I could do this

617
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
I can't do this

618
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
I can't do this

619
00:23:40,000 --> 00:24:06,000
I can't do this
