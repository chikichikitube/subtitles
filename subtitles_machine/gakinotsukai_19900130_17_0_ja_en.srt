1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Where are you going today?

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I don't know where, but I'm going to cut my hand off from Nittere next April.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
This year, right?

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Yes, this year.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Today, I'm going to Yokohama.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I'm going to be 3rd, so I'm going to be Mineshitero.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I don't need this kind of thing.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Don't mess with me.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I'm not good at carrying things like that.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I'm sorry that I was here before.

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm not going to be fooled by this kind of thing.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Hey, don't you guys have an appointment?

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Why don't you do it with just one T-shirt?

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
It's snowing, so don't make a mess.

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Goodbye, rotten Gedo Taku.

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Well, if the guest is also a rotten Gedo, the staff is also a rotten Gedo.

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Here it is.

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Today's venue, Sōtetsu Honda Theater.

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Yes.

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Let's go in here.

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Bring this set to this small place.

22
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Look at the staff.

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
What are we going to do today?

24
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Today, we're going to do a skit.

25
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
It's a little nostalgic.

26
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm going to do something nostalgic.

27
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
It's a skit that used to be popular.

28
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Yes, yes, yes.

29
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
It's a skit from that time.

30
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I'd like to do it.

31
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
It's just the right feeling.

32
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
After that, I'll send you a lot of live broadcasts in three and a half hours.

33
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Please look forward to it until the end.

34
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:42,000
This program is brought to you by Sunluck and Oyama International Products.

35
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Sponsored by the sponsor you are watching.

36
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I've already won.

37
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:17,000
What?

38
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
What are you doing?

39
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Stop it.

40
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I've already won.

41
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
What?

42
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Who are you?

43
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
What are you doing?

44
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
What are you doing?

45
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Stop it.

46
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
It's too early to get excited.

47
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I've already won.

48
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Who are you?

49
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Stop it.

50
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Stop it.

51
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
What are you doing?

52
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
What are you doing?

53
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
What are you doing?

54
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Stop it.

55
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Who are you?

56
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Who are you?

57
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Stop it.

58
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Stop it.

59
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Die.

60
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:28,000
You shouldn't do such a bad thing.

61
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Die.

62
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
You are weak.

63
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I'm not afraid even if you look at me like that.

64
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Go away.

65
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I won't look at you.

66
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Thank you.

67
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
It was hard for you today.

68
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
What?

69
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Thank you for coming today.

70
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
It's snowing for the first time in four years.

71
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I've never seen that much snow in Osaka.

72
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I was surprised.

73
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
It's hard to find the place.

74
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Here?

75
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Are you all from Yokohama?

76
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I always come here by taxi.

77
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I don't know where it is.

78
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I don't think it's on the third floor.

79
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I was walking alone.

80
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I became a hamako in five minutes.

81
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Are you kidding me?

82
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
How can you get used to it so easily?

83
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Hamako?

84
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,000
When I came here by car, it snowed a lot.

85
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I stopped driving because it was snowing.

86
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,000
So I came here an hour earlier than usual.

87
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I was in the pachinko shop of the president.

88
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Don't do that.

89
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
It's embarrassing.

90
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Don't do embarrassing things.

91
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I came here as soon as I finished work.

92
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
No one noticed you were in the pachinko shop.

93
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
No one noticed me.

94
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
All the shop assistants were there.

95
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
They were from different departments.

96
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Departments?

97
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Some of them were from different departments.

98
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
It was snowing a lot.

99
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,000
There were about 80 ambulances.

100
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
For that?

101
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
For that.

102
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
There were injured people and people who fell down and had to go to the hospital.

103
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I saw it on the news.

104
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
It's embarrassing.

105
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
It's in the neighborhood.

106
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
It's all in the neighborhood.

107
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,000
There are old people who die every year.

108
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
It's cool.

109
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
But I can't stand it.

110
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
It's not good.

111
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
People know the end of their life.

112
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
God has decided it.

113
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Who said that?

114
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I did.

115
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Why?

116
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
It's decided.

117
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
It's not decided by others.

118
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I can't believe what I said.

119
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,000
If someone said it was written in a book, everyone would accept it.

120
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
It's all decided.

121
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Who said it?

122
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I didn't.

123
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Who said it?

124
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I didn't come here to see this.

125
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
It was decided when I was born.

126
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
It can't be.

127
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
You think so, don't you?

128
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Why do you say that?

129
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Why do you think so?

130
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I did research like that.

131
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Where?

132
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
When?

133
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I read the book.

134
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I know it.

135
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Is there such a book?

136
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Yes.

137
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I'm better than Tanba Tetsuro.

138
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
There is a spirit world.

139
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
There is no hole.

140
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
What is there?

141
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,000
When humans and animals die, they go into the egg bag.

142
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Are you stupid?

143
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Why do they die?

144
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Why do they go into the egg bag?

145
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I don't know.

146
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
This is a serious story.

147
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Wait a minute.

148
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
What kind of state is it to go into the egg?

149
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
It's a human body.

150
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
It becomes a soul and goes into the egg.

151
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
It goes into the egg in this way.

152
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
You were born as a human being.

153
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,000
If you die, you will be born as a dog.

154
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Then you go into the dog's egg.

155
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Then you will be born as a dog.

156
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:33,000
The dog will mate and then I will go into the egg.

157
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
That's how it goes around.

158
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Tanba Tetsuro is lying.

159
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I want to talk to Tanba Tetsuro.

160
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
About that.

161
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I will win.

162
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Animals say they feel sorry for animals.

163
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:55,000
If the lion eats the animal, it will be a wild kingdom.

164
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,000
If the lion eats the deer, it will be a great deer.

165
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
That's right.

166
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
The deer will eat the lion of the animal.

167
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
That's right.

168
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
It's a brave deer.

169
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:18,000
If you look at the wild kingdom, the lion runs and goes to the deer herd.

170
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
If my mother sees it, she will say,

171
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I feel sorry for the deer, run away.

172
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I feel sorry for anyone who sees it.

173
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I feel sorry for the human emotions.

174
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Who are you?

175
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Even if the deer is bitten by a lion, it doesn't hurt.

176
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
That's right.

177
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
That's what you think.

178
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
If you are bitten by a lion, it hurts.

179
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
The deer doesn't hurt just because you think it hurts.

180
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
That's not true.

181
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:56,000
If you are bitten by a lion, it hurts.

182
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
The deer is like that.

183
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Why doesn't it hurt?

184
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
It's an animal, so it doesn't hurt.

185
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
There is no feeling of pain.

186
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
That's not true.

187
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
If you hit a dog or a cat, it will hurt.

188
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
No one says it hurts.

189
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
That's what you think.

190
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
If you look at the face, you can see it.

191
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
That's not true.

192
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
They don't care about the face.

193
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
That's what you think.

194
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Are you laughing?

195
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Is that so?

196
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
When the lion bites the deer,

197
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Does the deer look like this?

198
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
That's what you think.

199
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
That's what you think.

200
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
If you are bitten by a lion, you run away.

201
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
There is no reason to run away.

202
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Why?

203
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
The deer is awake.

204
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Let's go.

205
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
What will happen?

206
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
The deer is awake.

207
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
That's not true.

208
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
If you are bitten by a lion, it hurts.

209
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
That's not true.

210
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
If the deer dies and becomes a human,

211
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
It will enter the human body.

212
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
That's why the deer is running around.

213
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
That's not true.

214
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I don't care.

215
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
When I got on the Shinkansen,

216
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
There was a man sitting behind me.

217
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:33,000
He was reading a book he wrote.

218
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
He was reading a book he wrote.

219
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I thought he was reading a book.

220
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I thought he was reading a book.

221
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I thought he was reading a book.

222
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I have a letter.

223
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Today is great.

224
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I have a letter.

225
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
What is great?

226
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
The content of the letter is great.

227
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
There are two people today.

228
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
This is great.

229
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Oh my god.

230
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Are you brothers?

231
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Are you brothers?

232
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Which one is your sister?

233
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
How many siblings do you have?

234
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
What are you guys?

235
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I'm scared.

236
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
How many siblings do you have?

237
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Really? Why?

238
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I have an aunt.

239
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
You have an aunt?

240
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Look at me.

241
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Really?

242
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I think I saw it.

243
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Dad.

244
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Dad.

245
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
You have an aunt.

246
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I don't know.

247
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,000
You look like a bad father.

248
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Thank you very much.

249
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
If you can wear this, please come out.

250
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I'm sorry.

251
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Let me introduce you.

252
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I have a request for you two.

253
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Please make me your disciple.

254
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
It's not a joke.

255
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
It's a lifelong request.

256
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
It's not a joke.

257
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I really ask you.

258
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I watch all your programs.

259
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I really ask you.

260
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I really ask you.

261
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I'm a sixth grader.

262
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
That's right.

263
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Disciple.

264
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
It's about time.

265
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Why?

266
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
It's been eight or nine years since I entered this world.

267
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
It's been eight or nine years since I entered this world.

268
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
It's been nine years.

269
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Disciple.

270
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I have nothing to do.

271
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I'm just a disciple.

272
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
That's right.

273
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Yes.

274
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I go buy juice.

275
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
You're a bad boy.

276
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I have nothing to ask.

277
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I go buy juice.

278
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I'm just a disciple.

279
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I'm just a disciple.

280
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I have nothing to teach you.

281
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
That's right.

282
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I can't teach you to talk like this.

283
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Well, you can think about it.

284
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Next?

285
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Please tell us each other's habits.

286
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
If there is anything you want to stop with that habit, please tell us.

287
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Habits! Habits!

288
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
What about me?

289
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:54,000
You have a habit of sleeping anywhere.

290
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
No, I don't.

291
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
This is not an exaggeration to say that you have a habit.

292
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
That's not true.

293
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
It doesn't matter where you can sleep.

294
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Well, I sleep too much anywhere.

295
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I sleep in the dressing room all the time.

296
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I can really fall into a deep sleep.

297
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I think that's amazing.

298
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Oh, really?

299
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
It's deep.

300
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I also snore and talk in the dressing room.

301
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Are you kidding me?

302
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I do.

303
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I sometimes sneeze in the dressing room.

304
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I can't do that.

305
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I also sneeze in the dressing room.

306
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:39,000
He is happy when he sleeps.

307
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
He usually sleeps like this.

308
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
But he is like this.

309
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,000
If you don't like it, don't sleep.

310
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
You are like that.

311
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
What?

312
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,000
You are snoring but your eyes are open.

313
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
It's disgusting.

314
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Your eyes are open.

315
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
He is like this.

316
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
He is sleeping.

317
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
This is true.

318
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Right?

319
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Don't you snore?

320
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I sometimes snore.

321
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
My eyes are open.

322
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Yes.

323
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
My eyes are completely open.

324
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
It's true.

325
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
It's scary.

326
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
It's the first time.

327
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
It's scary.

328
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
It's true.

329
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
When I sleep with a girl...

330
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
It's scary, isn't it?

331
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
It's scary, isn't it?

332
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Over there.

333
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Yes, sometimes.

334
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Even if I say, right?

335
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Yes.

336
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
It's true.

337
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I was told,

338
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
What?

339
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I couldn't say,

340
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I couldn't say,

341
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
but when I woke up in the morning,

342
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:42,000
my eyes were open.

343
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
That's true.

344
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Even if you didn't wake me up,

345
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I was scared.

346
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Yes.

347
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
My eyes are open.

348
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I thought my eyes were open.

349
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Yes.

350
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
At that time,

351
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I wanted to stare at you.

352
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Don't joke with me.

353
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
You're a fool.

354
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I was scared.

355
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
And you two were hot.

356
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
You're a fool.

357
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Don't joke with me.

358
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Yes, it's true.

359
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
What else?

360
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
There was one good thing.

361
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
What is it?

362
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I couldn't imitate you.

363
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
What are you talking about?

364
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
You can do it.

365
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
What?

366
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I have a hundred of them.

367
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
You have a hundred of them.

368
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
You have a hundred of them.

369
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
You have a hundred of them.

370
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
You have more than I do.

371
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I don't have a hundred of them.

372
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Everyone knows that I imitate.

373
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I don't know.

374
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I've never done it before.

375
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I've never tried to imitate.

376
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
It's easy to imitate.

377
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Teach me how to imitate.

378
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Did you teach me?

379
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Yes.

380
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Good.

381
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
How to do it.

382
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
What do you want to do?

383
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
What number do you want to do?

384
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Number 35.

385
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Number 35.

386
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
It's Lupin.

387
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Is it true?

388
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Is it true?

389
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
It's true.

390
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
It's true.

391
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
It's Lupin.

392
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Teach me.

393
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
This is...

394
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
How do you do it?

395
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
What?

396
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Do you do it with your mouth?

397
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Yes.

398
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
How do I say?

399
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
It's a wave.

400
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I've done it before.

401
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
It goes up and down and up and down again.

402
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,000
It's like this.

403
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I didn't put the energy into it.

404
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
You let out your hand.

405
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I let out my hand.

406
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
If you let out your hand, it goes up.

407
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I said, Lupin!

408
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Then, you can't laugh.

409
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I'm not laughing.

410
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
It goes up.

411
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
What do you do?

412
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I said, Lupin!

413
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Does it look like it?

414
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I let out my hand.

415
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
It looks like Lupin.

416
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I really wanted to imitate Lupin.

417
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
It's good.

418
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
It goes up.

419
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
FUJIKO-CHAN!

420
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
FUJIKO-CHAN!

421
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Oh my!

422
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
FUJIKO-CHAN!

423
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
FUJIKO-CHAN!

424
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Oh my! FUJIKO-CHAN!

425
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
You're funny!

426
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
You can't get money!

427
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Number two!

428
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
This is a gift from SAIJO.

429
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Really?

430
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Really!

431
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
What did you do?

432
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
This is a bit difficult.

433
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I have to put a lot of pressure on my throat.

434
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Really?

435
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Then try it.

436
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
It's frustrating!

437
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Are you watching?

438
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
That's right.

439
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
What is that?

440
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
That's what I'm saying.

441
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
It's frustrating.

442
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
What did you do?

443
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,000
This is a bit difficult.

444
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
It's good.

445
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Really?

446
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
It's frustrating.

447
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
It's frustrating.

448
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
It's frustrating.

449
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,000
It's frustrating.

450
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,000
FUJIKO-CHAN!

451
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Are you watching?

452
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
It's fine.

453
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
You do something!

454
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
What did you do?

455
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
What did you do?

456
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
What did you do?

457
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
What did you do?

458
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
What did you do?

459
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
It's fine.

460
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
It's fine.

461
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
It's fine.

462
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
It's a new one.

463
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,000
There are a lot of people who can only be seen in Osaka.

464
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
For example?

465
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Like NOSUKE from ASIAKAN.

466
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
You don't know him, right?

467
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
UME-SAN!

468
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Who is UME-SAN?

469
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
He is the best.

470
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
He is number one.

471
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
He is number one.

472
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
The first person I remembered was UME-SAN.

473
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
From here, I started to walk the royal road.

474
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I want to walk!

475
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
The royal road.

476
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
UME-SAN.

477
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
UME-SAN.

478
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Everyone, close your eyes.

479
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Don't draw UME-SAN on your head.

480
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Let's draw UME-SAN.

481
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Let's go.

482
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Let's draw.

483
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
HIIROSHI!

484
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
HIIROSHI!

485
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
What is this?

486
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
From the first time.

487
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Have you done everything?

488
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I've done everything.

489
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
What was the last thing you massaged?

490
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
The 108th one?

491
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
The 108th one means最近.

492
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Yes, yes.

493
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
I don't know this anymore.

494
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
What is it?

495
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
He is my relative.

496
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
What is it?

497
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
You are doing such a repertoire.

498
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Of course.

499
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
You can't do that with 1 million yen.

500
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Who is it now?

501
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Who is it now?

502
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
He is my relative.

503
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I was told.

504
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
UME-SAN, you can't do that.

505
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
What?

506
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
What do you want me to do?

507
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
What do you want me to do?

508
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
What are you talking about?

509
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
HANA-CHAN, what are you talking about?

510
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Why?

511
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
What do you want me to do?

512
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
You can't do it properly.

513
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
You can't do it properly.

514
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Don't say that to others.

515
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
HIIROSHI!

516
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
What?

517
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
You don't have anything.

518
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
That's not cool.

519
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
That's why I said HIIROSHI.

520
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I see.

521
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
HIIROSHI!

522
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
What is it?

523
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
I want to cry.

524
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:11,000
That's all for today. Thank you very much.

525
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
It's over.

526
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Yes, it's over.

527
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
What happened?

528
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
It was cold today.

529
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
It was cold, wasn't it?

530
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
We only had one tough day.

531
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
It was hard.

532
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
I thought we were going to retire.

533
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Next week.

534
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
What are you going to wear next week?

535
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
I'm going to wear an SM school uniform.

536
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Yes!

537
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
I want to knit.

538
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,000
That's why everyone wears glasses like this.

539
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
I want to knit.

540
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
It's not dirty.

541
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I don't know if the camera can take it well.

542
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
That's because I have a whip in one hand.

543
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
The image quality is good.

544
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
I'm going to knit.

545
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Let's let NITTAR drive.

546
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Our manager NITTAR.

547
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Let's let NITTAR drive.

548
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
I'm going to put it on Twitter.

549
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Next week, NITTAR ATSUO,

550
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Downtown's manager NITTAR ATSUO,

551
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
He's going to wear an SM school uniform.

552
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
We'll be on the same team.

553
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
When NITTAR ATSUO's downtown manager was decided,

554
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
The head office told him,

555
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
You're in trouble from now on.

556
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I know what that means.

557
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
That's what I'm going to do.

558
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
I hope you understand.

559
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
That's it.

560
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
That's it for today.

561
00:23:37,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Thank you for watching.
