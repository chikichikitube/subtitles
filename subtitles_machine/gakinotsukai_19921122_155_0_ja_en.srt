1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Next, the Suki-Kiraito Pioneeent!

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
You're a heavyweight, aren't you?

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Don't you feel like you're going to make an enemy?

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
You?

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
No, in many ways.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
It says Suki-Kiraito, and it's up to number 7.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
And there are seven for you.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Seven, right?

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
From A to G. And there are seven for me too.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
We'll put them on randomly.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
We'll stick them on like this.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
And among them, there's the famous talent.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
So it's not our will.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
It's not our will?

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:01:02,000
If you stick them on randomly, you'll end up hating them.

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
And now, the winner.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
What's the winner?

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I don't know what the winner is.

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Let's give him a round of applause.

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
What?

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I really wanted to do it myself.

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Seriously, seriously.

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
What?

24
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Seriously, seriously.

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
It's stuck.

26
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Let's see how much you hate them.

27
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Okay.

28
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Here I go.

29
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Why do you hate them?

30
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Because they're gross.

31
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
It's all the way up to here.

32
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
When I put my hand out like this,

33
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
it reminds me of Chinese food.

34
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Suki.

35
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:02,000
You like sweet things.

36
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
How do you like Suki?

37
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Do you think I'll do it?

38
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
A little bit.

39
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Are you stupid?

40
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Why do I hate them?

41
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
You're the one who hates them.

42
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
When I said it on TV,

43
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I thought it was a bit harsh.

44
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
You're a good person.

45
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I'm really a good person.

46
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Really?

47
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I'm just a person who says what I think clearly.

48
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I've never heard Oe Senri sing before.

49
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
He said,

50
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Oe, this sound is off.

51
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
It's like this.

52
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
It's a mess.

53
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
It's a mess.

54
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
In the meantime, Oe was really depressed.

55
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
What do you like?

56
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
It's a mess.

57
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Where?

58
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I've never even talked to you.

59
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:13,000
You're bullying animals.

60
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
You don't even like them.

61
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
It's amazing that you can say that.

62
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
What?

63
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I often say that there are no bad people in people who like animals.

64
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
It's just a story that I really like.

65
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I hate you.

66
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
What do you call it?

67
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
It's selfish.

68
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
You're more selfish than selfish.

69
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I'm talking about him.

70
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
It's selfish.

71
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
What do you call it?

72
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
It's a mess.

73
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
What do you call it?

74
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
As a human being,

75
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
He's already 29 years old.

76
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
What do you call it?

77
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Do you call it a distinction?

78
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Do you call it morality?

79
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Do you call it common sense?

80
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
It's empty.

81
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Then it's my turn.

82
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Takeda Tetsuya is the image of Mr. Kinpachi.

83
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I still have that image.

84
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Mr. Kinpachi and Takeda Tetsuya have a big gap.

85
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
What is that?

86
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
The real gap is big.

87
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:51,000
That's not a bad word.

88
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I'm going to change my hairstyle.

89
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Do you hate your hair?

90
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
It's not human.

91
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I'm going to change my hairstyle.

92
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
You have a wide width.

93
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Your hair is flowing nicely.

94
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
This part.

95
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
It's refreshing.

96
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
It's a grayish style.

97
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
It's fashionable to wear red.

98
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I see.

99
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Let's go.

100
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:53,000
What do you hate about this?

101
00:05:53,000 --> 00:06:01,000
You're bullying the cast.

102
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I don't know.

103
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I don't know if it's okay to write a weekly magazine.

104
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
But when I look at it from the outside, I think,

105
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
What kind of person is this person?

106
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I think so.

107
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
You don't like magazines, do you?

108
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I don't like magazines.

109
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I hate it in that sense.

110
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Let's go to the person you hate.

111
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I really hate this.

112
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
What are you saying?

113
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I've hated it since the era of high socks.

114
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I don't think it's the era of high socks.

115
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
That's a lie.

116
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
It's okay to die in the sun on the hill.

117
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,000
The lyrics don't matter.

118
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
It doesn't matter.

119
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
This person has been in the industry for more than 20 years.

120
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Don't take my hate.

121
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

122
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
How long have you been in the industry?

123
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

124
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I don't know if you're a doctor or something.

125
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
That's exactly right.

126
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:26,000
That's exactly right.

127
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,000
What I like most about him is his hairstyle.

128
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
What do you call it?

129
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
What do you call it?

130
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
It's like a movie theater.

131
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Do you think so?

132
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:46,000
But his Japanese is good.

133
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Ladies and gentlemen.

134
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Agnes, I'm sorry.

135
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Why are you so honest?

136
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I'm just kidding.

137
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Why are you so desperate?

138
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I just wanted you to laugh.

139
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I'm sorry.

140
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
What should we talk about?

141
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I bought an interesting story.

142
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Did you win?

143
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I bought an interesting story.

144
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Whose story is interesting?

145
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Daisuke Hanako's story.

146
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Daibou really loves Hanako.

147
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
He really loves her.

148
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
There are two new boys.

149
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
They're called Pinocchio.

150
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I've heard of them.

151
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I don't know much about them.

152
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:08,000
There's a boy named Chambara Torio.

153
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
He has other students.

154
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Pinocchio is one of them.

155
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Daisuke Hanako and Pinocchio are brothers.

156
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Their relationship is very bad.

157
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
But they're beautiful.

158
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Pinocchio and Daisuke Hanako went out to drink.

159
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Daibou went home.

160
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Only Hanako went out to drink with Pinocchio.

161
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Pinocchio and Hanako broke up at 12 o'clock.

162
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Hanako likes alcohol.

163
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Pinocchio went home.

164
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Hanako didn't come back.

165
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Why?

166
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I don't know.

167
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
If I'm not funny, I'll be bad.

168
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Daibou knows about Pinocchio.

169
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Of course, he's Pinocchio.

170
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:15,000
The next day, Daibou is like a super saiyan.

171
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
He's like a super saiyan.

172
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Next day, Pinocchio came to the school.

173
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
He said, good morning.

174
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,600
The other guys knew that Daibou was gone, so they said,

175
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,600
Run away Pinocchio!

176
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,000
It's like a character.

177
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,700
Why did you run away?

178
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:34,700
That's right.

179
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:35,600
Why did you run away?

180
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,500
I don't know.

181
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,800
If that's the case, then Daibou will do this,

182
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,000
and Pinocchio will do that.

183
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,900
Yes, yes, yes.

184
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:45,700
I think that's Hana-chan's trick.

185
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:46,700
She's mistaken.

186
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:47,200
Yes.

187
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,500
Then Hana-chan will grab his shoulder,

188
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,800
and do this!

189
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,200
What did you do to my Hana-chan?

190
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,000
And then,

191
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,500
she hit him like this.

192
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,600
Pinocchio's partner,

193
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,500
was about to leave,

194
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,600
and he was waiting at the stage.

195
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,200
Pinocchio's partner?

196
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,000
What happened?

197
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:06,600
What happened?

198
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,500
Pinocchio's partner?

199
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,400
He hit him.

200
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,200
He went up to the stage,

201
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,700
and when he looked up,

202
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:12,900
he was Super Saiyan.

203
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:17,400
Where did Pinocchio go?

204
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,500
Hey!

205
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:22,300
He was like a brother to him.

206
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:22,900
Daiseki!

207
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:25,500
What did you do to my partner?

208
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,800
He grabbed him like this.

209
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,400
Then Daiseki,

210
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,200
this guy,

211
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,800
scratched my Hana-chan.

212
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,100
He scratched her because she was sexy.

213
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:38,000
Then Pinocchio's partner,

214
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:45,600
will do that!

215
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,400
That's what they say.

216
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:52,100
I don't know where Hana-chan went after all.

217
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:54,600
I don't know either.

218
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,600
Daigo really loves Hana-chan.

219
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,400
He loves her.

220
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:05,500
It's a difficult place.

221
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,200
Ah,

222
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,700
you've become a jet ski guy again.

223
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:11,700
That's right.

224
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:19,400
You've never been across the sea, have you?

225
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,100
You haven't even been to the sea recently.

226
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:24,400
What are you doing?

227
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,900
Ah, I forgot about that movie.

228
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:30,000
Forget it!

229
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,900
Ah, but he's good at surfing.

230
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:36,600
Surfing.

231
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:39,600
I took him to the hospital a long time ago.

232
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,300
He can also dive.

233
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:42,500
Scuba?

234
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,100
What?

235
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:46,600
That was a light answer.

236
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,200
Scuba.

237
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:52,600
I've been around the world a lot,

238
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,300
and I've dived a lot.

239
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:55,900
Which sea was the best?

240
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,600
Where did you dive?

241
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,500
I think it was...

242
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,900
the west coast.

243
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:06,000
The west coast?

244
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,300
Nairu River.

245
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:12,200
Wait a minute.

246
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,600
You took me to Nairu River.

247
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,000
Nairu River.

248
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,800
Do you think it's Nairu River?

249
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,200
I don't think so.

250
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,200
You took me to Nairu River.

251
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,400
I think so.

252
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,500
That's no good.

253
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,000
You're kidding.

254
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,200
Which was the best?

255
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,500
You know,

256
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:33,200
I've dived a lot in the sea.

257
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:38,300
The most beautiful thing was...

258
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:41,200
the Japan Sea.

259
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:47,800
The Japan Sea was the most beautiful.

260
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:50,600
I've been to New York.

261
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,700
I've been to Egypt.

262
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:54,000
Egypt?

263
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
You've been to Egypt?

264
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,200
I'm sorry, I was too early.

265
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,600
We're not talking about scuba diving.

266
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:06,000
I thought we were talking about scuba diving.

267
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,800
Show me how to do it.

268
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:09,900
The way to dive?

269
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:11,800
Show me the way to dive.

270
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:15,000
There's an oxygen bomb there.

271
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,400
In the middle of the ship.

272
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,000
The oxygen bomb is around there.

273
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,200
What?

274
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,000
You can't use it?

275
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,700
I'll use it.

276
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:26,800
I'll use it.

277
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,600
You can't use it.

278
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,200
I'll use it.

279
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,300
It's scuba diving.

280
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:32,200
It's scuba diving.

281
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,100
It's not scuba diving.

282
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:35,900
You can use the oxygen bomb like this.

283
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:38,600
Like this.

284
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,200
Like this?

285
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,000
Yes.

286
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
And then?

287
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,200
And then you can dive.

288
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,600
What?

289
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,500
You can dive like this?

290
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,500
You can dive like this?

291
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:50,100
There are people who say that.

292
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:53,800
I've never seen it.

293
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,700
Interesting.

294
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:58,800
Show me some signs.

295
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,400
When you dive.

296
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,800
What do you mean by a sign that it's dangerous?

297
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,700
For example, a shark is coming.

298
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:07,800
I can see it from here.

299
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:08,900
I have to tell it.

300
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:09,800
A shark?

301
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,300
I have to tell it.

302
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:13,200
That means a shark is coming from the other side.

303
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:13,800
Yes.

304
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,200
I have to tell it.

305
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:16,800
What do you do?

306
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,500
I look at it like this.

307
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,700
I can't tell its face.

308
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:24,600
I can't tell its face.

309
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,600
I can't tell its face.

310
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,400
Now everyone says it's easy to tell.

311
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:31,100
I can't tell its face.

312
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,900
I can't tell its face.

313
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:34,400
It's hard to tell.

314
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,900
You were too nervous.

315
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:38,000
Too nervous.

316
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,200
I'm smiling.

317
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,900
I think it's a shark.

318
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:47,500
You think so?

319
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,600
I can't tell its face.

320
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,800
I have to tell it.

321
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,000
There's a sign.

322
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,500
I can't tell its face.

323
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,100
It's a little far away.

324
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:56,000
It's a little far away.

325
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,300
I have to tell it.

326
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:58,900
Where is the shark?

327
00:15:58,900 --> 00:15:59,300
What?

328
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:00,100
Where is the shark?

329
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,400
Here.

330
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,500
The shark is coming.

331
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,900
It's swimming.

332
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,300
It's swimming.

333
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:12,400
I have to tell it.

334
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:16,500
Who is it?

335
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:20,300
It's that guy.

336
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:25,300
He said no.

337
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:27,500
He said no.

338
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:31,100
Come here.

339
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:35,300
Your face is red.

340
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:38,800
Why did you say no?

341
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,600
Why did you say no?

342
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,900
My partner.

343
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:44,500
Do you have a partner?

344
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,900
Are you aiming for an entertainer?

345
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:49,200
I have a lot of friends.

346
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,300
We know that you've decided.

347
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,200
I'm wearing a jacket with a hood.

348
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:57,300
A jacket with a hood?

349
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:00,700
We don't usually wear this.

350
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:05,600
The friends from earlier because we went together linked to force.

351
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,400
So, I've been forced to do it.

352
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,900
Why have you been forced to do it?

353
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:11,000
How did you manage it?

354
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
You're getting more and more rich.

355
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,400
You were also forced to do it, so I Words go out.

356
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,200
It can't be helped.

357
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:22,100
And then I thought you were golden.

358
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:26,900
They're already juniors.

359
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:31,900
That was Tsukumi Ota.

360
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:39,900
When a dog stumbles, it clings to human legs and shakes its hips.

361
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:43,900
What kind of psychological state is that?

362
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,900
What is the best way to calm it down?

363
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:48,900
Like this.

364
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:50,900
It's amazing.

365
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:54,900
If you leave it like that, it will stick here.

366
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,900
It comes out like this.

367
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:00,900
Ah, it comes out like this, white thing.

368
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:04,900
If you take that and put it somewhere, it will be something.

369
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:09,900
I think it will be fun if more things are done like that.

370
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:17,900
Like this, it sticks like this, and if you put this on the morning face, it will be morning face.

371
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:28,900
It would be funny if it was like that.

372
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:31,900
It would be funny.

373
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:38,900
But if they were the same animals, they wouldn't be able to do anything well.

374
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,900
What do you mean by anything?

375
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:47,900
They wouldn't be able to mate an elephant and a dog.

376
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:52,900
There would be a lot of animals.

377
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:56,900
But if they mate with a big animal, they would be able to take over the body.

378
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,900
That's not true.

379
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:04,900
If a male dog mates with a female elephant, it would be born from a female elephant.

380
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:14,900
But if a female elephant mates with a male dog, it would be born from a female elephant.

381
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:23,900
If a female dog mates with a male elephant, it would be born from a female elephant.

382
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,900
That's not true.

383
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:26,900
Why?

384
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,900
It would be born from a male elephant.

385
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:34,900
But if a female dog mates with a male elephant, it would be born from a female dog.

386
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:37,900
What do you mean by anything?

387
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:39,900
I'm saying the same thing.

388
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,900
It would be born from a male dog.

389
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:48,900
But if a female dog mates with a male dog, it would be born from a female dog.

390
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:49,900
What?

391
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:54,900
It would be born from a female cat.

392
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:55,900
What are you talking about?

393
00:19:55,900 --> 00:20:04,900
If a female dog mates with a male elephant, it would be born from a female dog.

394
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:06,900
It would be born from a female dog.

395
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:07,900
That's right.

396
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:08,900
That's enough.

397
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:09,900
That's right.

398
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:10,900
I'm done.

399
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:17,900
There are people who wear hoodies, but I've never seen people wearing hoodies.

400
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:20,900
When do you wear hoodies?

401
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:27,900
Wait a minute. The reason why I'm telling you this is because I don't recognize it.

402
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:28,900
What?

403
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:29,900
The hoodies you wear.

404
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:30,900
Why?

405
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:33,900
That's absolutely unnecessary.

406
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:36,900
I wear it when it's cold.

407
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:41,900
I'm asking if you can survive the cold when you wear it.

408
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:44,900
It's warm. I'm wearing it all. It's warm.

409
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:46,900
It covers the visible part.

410
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:47,900
That's right.

411
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:50,900
It's warmer than not wearing it.

412
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:52,900
That's right.

413
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:55,900
What are you talking about?

414
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,900
I'm talking about a female dog.

415
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:58,900
What?

416
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:01,900
What are you talking about?

417
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:05,900
Do you know what a female dog looks like?

418
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:15,900
Tell me about the female dog you drew on your head.

419
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:16,900
Tell me.

420
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,900
What are you talking about?

421
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:21,900
What's the size of a female dog?

422
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:22,900
What?

423
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:23,900
What's the size of a female dog?

424
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,900
It's about this big.

425
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:28,900
That's a female dog.

426
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:32,900
There's a difference between a male dog and a female dog.

427
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:35,900
I drew a female dog.

428
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:37,900
What about ears?

429
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:38,900
What?

430
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:39,900
What about ears?

431
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,900
It's about this big.

432
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:46,900
It's about the size of a female dog.

433
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:49,900
This is a human figure.

434
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:52,900
What are you talking about?

435
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:56,900
It's about the size of a female dog.

436
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:59,900
It's about the size of a female dog.

437
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:02,900
What's wrong with the nose?

438
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:03,900
What's wrong with the nose?

439
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:04,900
The nose is wet.

440
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:07,900
The nose is wet.

441
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:11,900
This is a dog.
