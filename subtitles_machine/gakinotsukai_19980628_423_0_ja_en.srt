00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Last week's broadcast

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I happened to watch your broadcast last week

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
You talked a lot last week

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
You talked for almost an hour

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
But you didn't have 10 minutes for the broadcast

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:25,000
So, this week's Gaki no Tsukai is very interesting, but I can't broadcast it

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I will show you a lot of unreleased talk

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Gaki no Tsukai, the best unreleased talk show

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
This program is provided by the sponsor you are watching

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
First of all, from this unreleased talk, there is an incident in Matsuo's room

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I have something I can't forgive

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
There was a time when I moved

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
It's not a good place

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
It's my first time to welcome summer

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I had a bad feeling when I moved

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:21,000
As summer approached, I watched Bokiburi

17
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
It's not a good place

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
What is it? Is it money?

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
No, it's a building

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
It's expensive

21
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
It's expensive, but it's about 200,000 yen

22
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
It's amazing if it's 200,000 yen

23
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
It can't be 200,000 yen

24
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I'm listening

25
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I understand

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Let's talk about the house

27
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Which one is amazing?

28
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I want you to listen

29
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
You live alone

30
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
You live alone

31
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
You don't live with your family

32
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
You live alone

33
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Let me explain

34
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I was shocked when I saw a cockroach

35
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Was it a big cockroach?

36
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Yes, it was

37
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I saw a few cockroaches

38
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
They were gone

39
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I looked at the kitchen

40
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
It was huge

41
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I had killed it before

42
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
It ran away under the refrigerator

43
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I couldn't kill it

44
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I don't live alone

45
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I understand

46
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
But I can't communicate with it

47
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I wanted to live alone

48
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
You killed it

49
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I couldn't kill it

50
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I saw a cockroach

51
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I didn't like it

52
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I didn't like it

53
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I did it for that

54
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I did my best

55
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I lived in a place like this

56
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Why did I see a cockroach?

57
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
It's strange

58
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I did it for that

59
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
It's hard

60
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
There is another house in the kitchen

61
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
It's your house

62
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
It's your house

63
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
This space is your house

64
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I spend money in his house every month

65
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I don't know if it's good or bad

66
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
But I spend money in his house

67
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
You have money so you can move

68
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Is that so?

69
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
What are you talking about?

70
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I really don't like it

71
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I'll move the refrigerator

72
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
It will move

73
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
It will move

74
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
What are you talking about?

75
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I'm more sensitive to cockroaches than normal people

76
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Everyone is

77
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
When I was a kid, cockroaches were amazing

78
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
My parents

79
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
The floor was moving

80
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
It was terrible

81
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I put a water pillow on the pillar

82
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
All the cockroaches were hiding behind the water pillow

83
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
There is no mistake that the cockroaches live here

84
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
We gathered all the newspapers

85
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
All my family

86
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,000
My father said, let's move the water pillow

87
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
We moved the water pillow

88
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:31,000
All the cockroaches were hiding behind the water pillow

89
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I was a good kid

90
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
All my family was crying

91
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I was crying

92
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I wanted to say goodbye to the cockroaches

93
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
So I did my best

94
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
But there are still cockroaches

95
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
It's scary, isn't it?

96
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
It's okay

97
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
You haven't seen it since then, have you?

98
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
It was two or three days ago

99
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
It's amazing

100
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
At night

101
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I was rapping

102
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
It was moving

103
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
It was moving

104
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
It was moving

105
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I have a great appetite

106
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
You know a lot

107
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
You were a good kid

108
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,000
My family had a lot of cockroaches and cicadas

109
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I'm sorry I didn't say it

110
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
There was a cat, it wasn't a cat

111
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
It was a cicada

112
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I said it was a cicada

113
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
It was a cat

114
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
It wasn't a cat, it was a cicada

115
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Throw it away

116
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
In summer, I said it was a cicada

117
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
It was a cicada and I was wearing a collar

118
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
It was a black one

119
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
My brother was surprised

120
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
His face was like this

121
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
He said it was a cicada

122
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
It was a cicada

123
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
It was a cicada

124
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Because all the cicadas eat here

125
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,600
All of my family members were from here.

126
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,340
It was amazing.

127
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:10,160
So even if I went to the pool or the beach with my family,

128
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,160
they wouldn't recognize me even if I was looking at them from behind.

129
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,160
Oh, it's my dad.

130
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,880
Oh, it's my big brother.

131
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,400
I've never made a mistake.

132
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,400
When I looked at them, they were all eating.

133
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,400
What a poor family.

134
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,680
What a poor family.

135
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,680
I don't have any drinking friends.

136
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,680
I don't have any drinking friends.

137
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,680
I'm sure you're okay.

138
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,680
I can't forgive the bugs in my house.

139
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,680
You might think, why are you here?

140
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,680
I don't know.

141
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,680
There are spiders here.

142
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,680
You shouldn't kill spiders.

143
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,680
They're all over the place.

144
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,680
They're all over the place.

145
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,680
I'm taking care of the spiders.

146
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,680
I'm taking care of the spiders.

147
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,680
Let them go!

148
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,680
I'm taking care of the spiders.

149
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,680
I don't want to kill them.

150
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,680
You don't want to kill the spiders?

151
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,680
Where's the time?

152
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,680
Where are the morning people?

153
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,680
I don't know!

154
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:14,680
You can come back and kill the spiders.

155
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:18,680
But the man in the bath is there.

156
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,680
I'll take the spiders away.

157
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,680
I went swimming once.

158
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:26,680
I got a spider when the water was too hot.

159
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:35,680
He was trying not to get caught, but he fell, and he was spinning in the bath tub where the hot water was flowing.

160
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,680
I said, no!

161
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,680
Why did you use that?

162
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,680
Because I wanted to kill him.

163
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,680
You shouldn't have let him go.

164
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,680
I shouldn't have let him go.

165
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,680
But he was spinning.

166
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,680
You shouldn't have let him go.

167
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,680
So I hit him on the other side.

168
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,680
Why?

169
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,680
And he was still in the bath.

170
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,680
He was still coming this way.

171
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,680
Why was he trying to die?

172
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,680
Because I wanted to kill him.

173
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,680
It's okay.

174
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,680
But I'm moving.

175
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,680
You're moving?

176
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,680
How much money do you have?

177
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,680
I have a lot of money.

178
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,680
You're so nice.

179
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,680
It's okay.

180
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,680
If it's like this, I'll open it.

181
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:27,680
The animal lover Matsumoto is taking pictures of a stupid dog.

182
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,680
I want you to tell me about animals.

183
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,680
I heard that lazy people don't get off the tree until they die.

184
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,680
But if you get off the tree, what will happen?

185
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,680
What will happen if you get off the tree?

186
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:42,680
I'm sure you've never seen a lazy person get off the tree, right?

187
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,680
I think I'm the only one who's seen it.

188
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,680
I saw it when I went over there.

189
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:50,680
Where?

190
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,680
When I went to Europe.

191
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,680
Europe?

192
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,680
A little further from Europe.

193
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,680
I saw it completely.

194
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,680
That's funny.

195
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,680
You saw it when you got off the tree?

196
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:05,680
I saw it when I got off the tree.

197
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,680
Do you know what happened?

198
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,680
I know.

199
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,680
I think I thought no one was watching.

200
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:16,680
When people are watching, they care about their character.

201
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,680
So they never get off the tree.

202
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:19,680
That's right.

203
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,680
Most animals are conscious because people are watching.

204
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:25,680
I'm a cat, so I have to be a cat.

205
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,680
I do this and that.

206
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,680
When people don't get off the tree, they're already dead.

207
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,680
Your face is just funny.

208
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,680
Yes, that's true.

209
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:35,680
You're a lazy person.

210
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:40,680
I saw a lazy person getting off the tree.

211
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,680
What are you doing?

212
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,680
I was getting off the tree.

213
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,680
Yes.

214
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,680
When I got off the tree, I looked around.

215
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,680
You looked around.

216
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,680
How long have I been doing this?

217
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,680
I got off the tree.

218
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,680
I was looking at the tree like this.

219
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,680
What are you doing?

220
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:12,680
I was looking at the tree like this.

221
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:13,680
I see.

222
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,680
I was hitting the tree.

223
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,680
That's about it.

224
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,680
It was really fun to see it live.

225
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:35,680
It's been a long time since I've laughed so hard.

226
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,680
I'm glad.

227
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:45,680
I went to the countdown TV the other day.

228
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,680
At that time, I and you...

229
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:55,680
I knew that the staff who had never worked before were scared.

230
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,680
That's not true.

231
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,680
There are five pipe seats.

232
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:03,680
Five is the number of members.

233
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:08,680
There was a soft sofa next to the pipe chair.

234
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,680
I didn't know that.

235
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,680
What does that mean?

236
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,680
The other members told me to sit in the pipe chair.

237
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:21,680
I thought I would go crazy if I had seven pipe chairs.

238
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:25,680
This is the end of the broadcast.

239
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,680
Actually, there's a talk after this.

240
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:31,680
I have to get rid of this image.

241
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,680
So don't make such a face.

242
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,680
That's right.

243
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:39,680
Let's stop it.

244
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:46,680
Even if it rains, when I get out of the car and go to the studio,

245
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:51,680
I'm only three meters away from the car, but I'm hit by an umbrella.

246
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,680
I'm hit by an umbrella.

247
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,680
I'm hit by an umbrella.

248
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,680
You will be hit.

249
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,680
Really?

250
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:01,680
Can't you do that?

251
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,680
I'm sick while doing this.

252
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:11,680
Who sticks an umbrella like this?

253
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,680
Most people do it.

254
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,680
I always tell them to stop.

255
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:21,680
I always tell them to hold it if they want to stick an umbrella.

256
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:25,680
I don't want to talk about it anymore.

257
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,680
If I try to take it again, I'll be scared.

258
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:34,680
I don't like it when people on the other side pay attention to me.

259
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:35,680
I see.

260
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,680
It's amazing when I put on a microphone.

261
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:41,680
I've been told many times that I'm sorry.

262
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:45,680
There's nothing to be sorry about.

263
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,680
I'm really sorry.

264
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,680
It's true.

265
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,680
I've been told many times that I'm sorry.

266
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:55,680
But I have a little bit of a knife in me.

267
00:12:58,680 --> 00:12:59,680
Yes.

268
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,680
I'm sorry to say this, but I have a knife in me.

269
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,680
I'm sorry to say this, but I have a knife in me.

270
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:11,680
The other day, I talked about Tsurube's show.

271
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:15,680
I don't have to say it.

272
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:19,680
I'm being treated like that.

273
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,680
I'm being treated like I'm trying to make a good image.

274
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:23,680
That's annoying.

275
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,680
That's annoying.

276
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:25,680
I don't care.

277
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,680
I see.

278
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,680
Which side are you on?

279
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,680
I'm against it.

280
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:43,680
I don't want you to come here.

281
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,680
You should fight with yourself.

282
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,680
That's right.

283
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:57,680
I'll go.

284
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,680
Thank you very much.

285
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:17,680
I think her parents are watching TV, too.

286
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,680
I think they'll call me and ask,

287
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:25,680
Why are you on the show?

288
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,680
I don't know how to explain it.

289
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,680
I didn't do anything.

290
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,680
It's a flow.

291
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:37,680
You'll understand when you watch it.

292
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,680
I don't know her parents.

293
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,680
That's right.

294
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:45,680
The other day, there was a party at Itao's house.

295
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,680
What did her family think?

296
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,680
They were shocked.

297
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:51,680
That's right.

298
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,680
We're crazy, aren't we?

299
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:56,680
We talk about silly things.

300
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:59,680
We talk about silly things.

301
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,680
I don't like that.

302
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:01,680
I don't like that.

303
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:06,680
I don't know what it is, but Itao's wife has been taking care of her father.

304
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,680
I don't know.

305
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,680
I don't like that kind of clothes.

306
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:14,680
She wants to be sexy.

307
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,680
I don't like that.

308
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,680
I don't like her father.

309
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:23,680
I'm going to change my hair color.

310
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,680
I'll go back and see what happens next.

311
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,680
I don't like it.

312
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,680
I went to karaoke and changed my clothes.

313
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,680
I don't like it.

314
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,680
I don't like it.

315
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:39,680
Thank you for today.

316
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,680
I'll take this.

317
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:51,680
When the ticket was split in half at the academy and Cannes,

318
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:56,680
I asked Mr. Matsumoto who decided the prize by putting the ticket in the end.

319
00:15:56,680 --> 00:16:01,680
The Hollywood version of Godzilla is a completely different thing from the Japanese Godzilla.

320
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:06,680
What kind of Godzilla would you like to see in the Matsumoto version?

321
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:10,680
I was asked a big question.

322
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,680
Is Godzilla completely different?

323
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,680
The face is completely different.

324
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,680
Godzilla is very aggressive.

325
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,680
Godzilla?

326
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,680
You've seen most of the video, haven't you?

327
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,680
Godzilla is very aggressive.

328
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,680
I want to see it.

329
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,680
I want to see the gorilla.

330
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:35,680
If you're going to shoot this time,

331
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,680
I'll be the director.

332
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,680
What kind of Godzilla would you like to see?

333
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:43,680
I imitated Tanaka Kakuen.

334
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,680
I just said, well.

335
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,680
I want to convey it.

336
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:52,680
I make movies while communicating.

337
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:57,680
It's hard to imitate someone you don't know.

338
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,680
But you want to use a person with a name, right?

339
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:03,680
If you think so, I'll ask you to do Mothra.

340
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,680
As you can see from the Hollywood version of Godzilla,

341
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,680
It doesn't matter.

342
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,680
If you don't reverse the previous one, it doesn't make sense.

343
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:15,680
If you're going to do Mothra, you're Mothra.

344
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,680
You don't have to do anything.

345
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,680
What do you mean?

346
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,680
You don't have to do anything.

347
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,680
Well, I'm...

348
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,680
No, no, no.

349
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,680
You're wearing something.

350
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,680
No, no, no.

351
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,680
I'm wearing my own clothes.

352
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,680
No, no, no.

353
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,680
Wait a minute.

354
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,680
What?

355
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,680
Say Mothra.

356
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,680
I'll do it like this.

357
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,680
No, I'm...

358
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,680
I'm saying Mothra.

359
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,680
I don't do anything.

360
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:50,680
No, no, no. Wait a minute.

361
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,680
It's not big.

362
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,680
Just like this?

363
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,680
It's Mothra.

364
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,680
Mothra 3.

365
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:07,680
If everyone says Mothra,

366
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,680
It's Mothra.

367
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,680
You're Mothra.

368
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:11,680
I'll do it normally.

369
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,680
I see.

370
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,680
How about this?

371
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,680
It's okay.

372
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:18,680
Let's say I'm your version of Mothra.

373
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,680
Yes.

374
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,680
What about Godzilla?

375
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,680
That's a real Godzilla.

376
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,680
That's...

377
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,680
That's a little weird, isn't it?

378
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,680
Why?

379
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,680
I'm Mothra.

380
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,680
I'm saying Mothra.

381
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,680
Godzilla like this...

382
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,680
It's a big monster.

383
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,680
Godzilla vs. Mothra, right?

384
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:45,680
I'm saying Mothra.

385
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:50,680
Godzilla doesn't know Mothra.

386
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,680
That's why the shell is here.

387
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,680
It's okay if it's a big monster.

388
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,680
It's on the screen.

389
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,680
It's about the same as Godzilla.

390
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,680
There's a cut scene.

391
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,680
It's okay.

392
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:07,680
You'll take a picture of the same thing, right?

393
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,680
I'll take it.

394
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:12,680
For example, if it's an X-ray, people will say,

395
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,680
I'm Mothra or Godzilla.

396
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,680
I'm just walking around.

397
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,680
I'm not being told anything.

398
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:19,680
Look at Godzilla.

399
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,680
The person who runs away comes like this.

400
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,680
You're like this.

401
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:30,680
But I'm scared, so I don't run away.

402
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:31,680
That's Mothra.

403
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,680
Godzilla is like this.

404
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,680
But I can't do anything.

405
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,680
How interesting.

406
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:41,680
You've had a lot of women turn their backs on you.

407
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,680
Yes.

408
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:47,680
You've had a lot of women turn their backs on you.

409
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:51,680
How did you get them to turn their backs on you?

410
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,680
This is amazing.

411
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,680
If this is true,

412
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:04,680
everyone is turning their backs on you.

413
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:09,680
You're just not aware of it.

414
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,680
Tell me how you do it.

415
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:14,680
You go like this.

416
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,680
You came from far away.

417
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:23,680
You get off the train and get off in front of Hachikoa.

418
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,680
You go like this.

419
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:28,680
This is Asakusa.

420
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,680
I understand that.

421
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,680
The way is like this.

422
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,680
You go like this.

423
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,680
I'm sorry.

424
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:48,680
Don't bite when I say this.

425
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:53,680
But I'm turning my back on you.

426
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,680
I see.

427
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:58,680
You're turning your back on me for a reason.

428
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:01,680
But that's what everyone says.

429
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:04,680
Hachikoa isn't like Asakusa.

430
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,680
I'm not turning my back on you.

431
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,680
Really?

432
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:10,680
If I were you, I'd be more stupid.

433
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,680
You're funny.

434
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:16,680
You're more stupid than I am.

435
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:19,680
I'm not like Asakusa in Shibuya.

436
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:23,680
When I'm alone at home, I'm really stupid.

437
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:27,680
When I was alone at home, I walked like this.

438
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,680
I'm totally free.

439
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,680
No one laughs.

440
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,680
No one laughs.

441
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,680
I came here again.

442
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,680
It was very interesting.

443
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:49,680
Let's make a song together.

444
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:56,680
Fujiwara is amazing.

445
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:59,680
That's true.

446
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:03,680
He was working in our apartment.

447
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,680
He was noisy and hard to sleep.

448
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:08,680
But that doesn't matter to Fujiwara.

449
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:13,680
It's a normal conversation.

450
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:17,680
Fujiwara was noisy today, too.

451
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:20,680
It doesn't matter to Fujiwara.

452
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,680
It's a normal conversation.

453
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:25,680
I'm sorry.

454
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,680
I'm sorry.

455
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:31,680
I'm sorry.

456
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,680
This is the end of the broadcast.

457
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:36,680
After this, there will be unexpected developments.

458
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:39,680
I don't want to be treated like that.

459
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:42,680
I want Fujiwara to call me Machan.

460
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:45,680
That's not true.

461
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,680
If Fujiwara says that, I can't do it.

462
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:50,680
I can't do it.

463
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,680
That's okay.

464
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:55,680
After this, I can't be called Machan.

465
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,680
I don't care at all.

466
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,680
I don't care at all.

467
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:03,680
I want to be kicked in the ass.

468
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:07,680
This is the end of the broadcast.

469
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:12,680
I don't want to be treated like that.

470
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:15,680
You're biting me.

471
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:20,680
Machan, you're tired.

472
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,680
If you kick me, I'll kick you.

473
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:25,680
I wanted you to kick me.

474
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:29,680
Machan, you're tired.

475
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:32,680
I'm sorry.

476
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:36,680
Kick me now.

477
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:39,680
I want to be kicked in the ass.

478
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:46,680
I'll come to see you again.

479
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:51,680
If I have a chance like this again, I would like to come.

480
00:23:51,680 --> 00:24:00,680
Thank you very much.
