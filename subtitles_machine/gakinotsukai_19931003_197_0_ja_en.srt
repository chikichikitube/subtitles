1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
It's itchy!

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
In the first episode of Gaki no Tsukai Arahen, Chikichiki!

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000

Today is Gaki no Tsukai staff comedy show!

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
It's just like the title!

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
No one will understand, right?

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
But we will do our best!

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
First is the first person!

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Please!

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
What are you doing?

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Come here!

14
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
What are you doing?

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Where are you going?

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Where are you going?

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Where are you going?

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
What's your name?

19
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I'm from Saitama prefecture. I'm the producer, Suga.

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
What? Was that Hikaru Genki?

21
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
What are you doing?

22
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Gaki no Tsukai staff comedy show!

23
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I want to be a flower.

24
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
You come to me secretly.

25
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
You pick me up and hold me in your hands.

26
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I also want to be a red grape.

27
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I want to be sweet from your mouth.

28
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
What are you talking about?

29
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
It has nothing to do with you!

30
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
It has nothing to do with a bird!

31
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Next is this person!

32
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Where are you from?

33
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I'm from Kyoto. I'm Yamasaki.

34
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
From Kyoto?

35
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Yamasaki-san, did you come from Kyoto?

36
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Yes!

37
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Why are you saying it again?

38
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Yamasaki-san, I'm looking forward to working with you.

39
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I will defeat the bear!

40
00:02:50,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Kuno, come on!

41
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Ah! It hurts! It hurts! It hurts!

42
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Yamasaki-san, what was that?

43
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I just removed my shoulder.

44
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Yamasaki-san!

45
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Escalator!

46
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Thank you very much.

47
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Yamasaki-san!

48
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
It was good!

49
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
It was good!

50
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Thank you very much!

51
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Next is Umeda-san.

52
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

53
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I don't know who you are!

54
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I will imitate the site director.

55
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
The site director?

56
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Hey!

57
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Next is this person!

58
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I'm from Nara. I'm Tsutsumimoto.

59
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I'm in Hamada-san's dressing room.

60
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
You're in my dressing room?

61
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I'm sleepy.

62
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Good morning.

63
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
You have a big chest.

64
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
What are you talking about?

65
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Hey!

66
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
You're in my dressing room!

67
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Momi! Momi! Momi!

68
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
It's quite safe. Do it once.

69
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
What are you talking about?

70
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Next is this person!

71
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
You're in my dressing room!

72
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Go home!

73
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Next is this person!

74
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Good morning.

75
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I'm from Shiga. I'm Noriasu.

76
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
From Shiga?

77
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I like spicy food.

78
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Is that so?

79
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Even if you lick this, you can smile a lot.

80
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I see.

81
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Please lick it.

82
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I don't want to lick it.

83
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I don't understand.

84
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Thank you very much.

85
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Wait!

86
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Next is this person!

87
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I'm Ayatori.

88
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I see.

89
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Hoki.

90
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Thank you very much.

91
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Next is this person!

92
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I'm going to tear off the manga.

93
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I might not be able to tear it off.

94
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
What are you talking about?

95
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Sueki-san, the camera is filming you.

96
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Sueki-san, the camera is filming you.

97
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
One, two...

98
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Sueki-san, that's good.

99
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Next is this person!

100
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Good morning.

101
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Good morning.

102
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I'm from Shiga.

103
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I'm Adachi.

104
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Today, I'm going to try a super magic trick.

105
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Is that so?

106
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Can you tie me up?

107
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Yes.

108
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
You can tie me up like this.

109
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Yes.

110
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Are you really okay, Adachi-san?

111
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Is this okay?

112
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Adachi-san, please.

113
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Here I go!

114
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Adachi-san!

115
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Sueki-san!

116
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
What are you doing?

117
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Sueki-san!

118
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Sueki-san!

119
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Go home!

120
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Next person, please!

121
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
What's your name?

122
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I'm from Amagasaki. I'm Takasu.

123
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I'm from Amagasaki. I'm Takasu.

124
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I'm from Nara. I'm Okamoto.

125
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
What are you going to do today?

126
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Acrobat.

127
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Acrobat?

128
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
You've been doing this for a long time?

129
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
About 10 years.

130
00:08:50,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Then, both of you, please.

131
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
You've been doing this for a long time?

132
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
About 10 years.

133
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
You've been doing this for a long time?

134
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
You've been doing this for a long time?

135
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
This is the last person.

136
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
This is the last person.

137
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
This is the last person.

138
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:58,000
This is the last person.

139
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Today, at the opening...

140
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Today, at the opening...

141
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Everyone enjoyed it very much.

142
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Everyone enjoyed it very much.

143
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
You didn't have the energy to do it?

144
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I didn't have the energy to do it.

145
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
You didn't have the energy to do it?

146
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I think...

147
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I think...

148
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
You're still here?

149
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
You can predict the future, right?

150
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
This is one of your talents.

151
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
You should have told me when we first met.

152
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I've been thinking about a lot of things.

153
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
You didn't reply.

154
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
You didn't tell me anything.

155
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I've been thinking about what I'm going to do next year and the year after that.

156
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Somehow.

157
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I can't see it right now.

158
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
That means...

159
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I want to see it.

160
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I don't know if I'll be able to break it next year.

161
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I heard you're dead.

162
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Do you think I'm dead?

163
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I did it.

164
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I really can't see it.

165
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I'm dead.

166
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I'm dead.

167
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I'm being killed.

168
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I think you're crazy.

169
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Who?

170
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
The guy with long hair.

171
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
The guy with long hair.

172
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Bring me a knife.

173
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Mr. Katsuki!

174
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
You really...

175
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Don't say things like that!

176
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:46,000
If you say things like that, I really think the guy with long hair is me.

177
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
And then there's going to be something funny again.

178
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I'm going to make it funny again.

179
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
You're going to color it.

180
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I'm going to make it funny again.

181
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Last time, I was able to make it funny and funny.

182
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
But this time, I'm going to make it funny and funny.

183
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
No one can do that.

184
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
No one can do that.

185
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Please be careful.

186
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
My fans are really crazy.

187
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I wonder why.

188
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I'm a little scared.

189
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I see.

190
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
There are people who use me.

191
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Are you stupid?

192
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I'm not stupid. I think that's what they think.

193
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
If you think that way, you shouldn't say such a thing.

194
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
You shouldn't say such a thing.

195
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:41,000
The guy who thinks he's a professor is sick because of the professor.

196
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I thought it was over last week, but I still want to say it.

197
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,000
If what you're saying is right, that's what it is.

198
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Why is she saying that?

199
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,000
She thinks she's a professor, but she's sick.

200
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
She's saying that.

201
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I see.

202
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Right?

203
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I see.

204
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
You don't have to open your mouth.

205
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
You're just crazy.

206
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I am.

207
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
But there are a lot of people like that around me.

208
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I wonder why.

209
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I'm really worried about this, too.

210
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,000
If it's a little off, it's about what you say and do.

211
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
We have something in common.

212
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
If it's my feeling, she'll understand.

213
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
That's true.

214
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I saw something like a fairy the other day.

215
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
You're saying that, too.

216
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
When you go home, there's a fairy next to the pot.

217
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
That's what you say.

218
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000
When I saw it, I thought, wow, she's here.

219
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
And finally, if it's a match, she'll believe it.

220
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
She'll believe it.

221
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
That's it.

222
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
That's definitely it.

223
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I've seen a lot of fairies, too.

224
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
That's the problem.

225
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Why?

226
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
There's no way I've seen it.

227
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
No, no, no, I've seen it.

228
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I've seen it, but what I'm seeing and what she's seeing is probably different.

229
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
It's a different kind of thing.

230
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
If you say that, she'll think again.

231
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Why?

232
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
What kind of fairy are you?

233
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I've seen a lot of them, so what kind of fairy are you?

234
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
If you say one thing, she'll say, I've seen a lot of them.

235
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
When I opened the fridge, she was there.

236
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
That's what I'm saying.

237
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Hey, hey, I'm home.

238
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I didn't open it.

239
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
She was there.

240
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
What kind of fairy are you?

241
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
What kind of fairy are you?

242
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
If you say that on TV, she'll say, it's about me.

243
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Why?

244
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
If it's about that, I want you to come.

245
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I want to see it.

246
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I've been saying there are fairies in many places.

247
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
That's why I don't like it if you just say what you saw in the fridge.

248
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
What kind of fairy are you?

249
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
What kind of clothes are you wearing?

250
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:08,000
What kind of clothes are you wearing?

251
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I'm a fairy who doesn't wear clothes.

252
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
You're naked.

253
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I'm naked.

254
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
The one I saw the other day.

255
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
What about your tongue?

256
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
My tongue is like a horse.

257
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
That's not a fairy.

258
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
That's not a fairy.

259
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
You're holding it like this.

260
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
It's a fairy.

261
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
It's like a horse.

262
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
That's why I was sleeping.

263
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
That's why I was sleeping.

264
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Hey, wait.

265
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Hurry up and say something like that.

266
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Didn't you open the fridge when you got home?

267
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Were you sleeping?

268
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I was sleeping.

269
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Didn't you wake up?

270
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
You were sleeping at night.

271
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I was sleeping at home at night.

272
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I want to make that sound.

273
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
That's right.

274
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Why?

275
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
What is this sound?

276
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I saw a lot of things.

277
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
There's no mistake in the fridge.

278
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I can hear it from the inside.

279
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I can hear it from the inside.

280
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I opened the fridge.

281
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Then I heard a sound like this.

282
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Wait a minute, everyone.

283
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
It's okay.

284
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I heard a sound like this.

285
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I was running.

286
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Maybe it's because it's a fridge.

287
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I heard a sound like this.

288
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
It's because it's cold.

289
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
It's because it's cold.

290
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,000
You can leave it alone.

291
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I opened the fridge.

292
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
It's a fairy.

293
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
It has a kind face.

294
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I opened the fridge.

295
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I opened the fridge.

296
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Why?

297
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
What are you looking at?

298
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Which one?

299
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
What are you looking at?

300
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I was surprised.

301
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
You won't open it again, will you?

302
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Of course I'll open it again.

303
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Did you open it?

304
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Did you see a scary thing?

305
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I opened it.

306
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
You opened it.

307
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I opened it.

308
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Why do humans wave their hands when they walk?

309
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Are they waving?

310
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
They're not conscious.

311
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:28,000
What happens when humans walk?

312
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
It's not that strange, is it?

313
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
But it's hard to walk.

314
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
There's a reason.

315
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:39,000
There must be a reason.

316
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
What kind of reason?

317
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,000
What kind of reason?

318
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Are you thinking about it now?

319
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
No, I'm not thinking about it.

320
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Just say it.

321
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Why do humans wave their hands?

322
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Of course.

323
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Why do humans wave their hands?

324
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Why do humans wave their hands?

325
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Of course.

326
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Why do humans wave their hands?

327
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Why do humans wave their hands?

328
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Don't say that!

329
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
You're a human.

330
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
No, no.

331
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Don't say something you don't like.

332
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
If you say that, I don't like it.

333
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
You should understand.

334
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I don't understand what you're saying.

335
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I don't understand what you're saying.

336
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Why do you wave your hands?

337
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Because I'm waving my hand naturally.

338
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,000
What do you mean by walking?

339
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
What do you mean?

340
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I'm waving my hands at you.

341
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
You should say that too.

342
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
No, no.

343
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I don't understand.

344
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Say it.

345
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I don't understand, so I'm saying it again.

346
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
What do you mean?

347
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
What do you mean by walking?

348
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
What do you mean by walking?

349
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Wave your hands.

350
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
No, no.

351
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Wave your hands.

352
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I don't understand.

353
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Wave your hands.

354
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I'm asking you. What do you mean?

355
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I'm asking you. What do you mean by walking?

356
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I'm asking you.

357
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
That's just what you wanted to say.

358
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I'm asking you. What do you mean by you don't understand?

359
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I understand.

360
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:06,000
When Japan didn't have the government...

361
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
When Toyotomi Hideyoshi was still Kinoshita Tokichiro...

362
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
That's what I'm thinking.

363
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
That's what you're thinking.

364
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:21,000
At that time, we were still walking like this.

365
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
It's strange. It's hard to walk.

366
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
That's what everyone said.

367
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
What do you think?

368
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
What do you think?

369
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Come on, everyone. Let's talk.

370
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Aren't you going to walk? Come on, everyone.

371
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Everyone was walking like this.

372
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I understand that.

373
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
At that time, only one person said,

374
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Hey, what?

375
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Why are you so fast?

376
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
You guys are fast.

377
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Why are you so fast?

378
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Yuta?

379
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Yuta.

380
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Really?

381
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Why am I so fast?

382
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Why is everyone so fast?

383
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Why is everyone so fast?

384
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
This is the recording of the children's machine.

385
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Is that so?

386
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
This is a set.

387
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
What are you doing?

388
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Where did you come from?

389
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
I came from Hyogo Prefecture.

390
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Hyogo Prefecture?

391
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
What is your name?

392
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
My name is Matsumoto.

393
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Matsumoto?

394
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
I run a bar called Sanpatsu Yahoo Izakaya.

395
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
What?

396
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
What are you going to do today?

397
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
I'm going to do a one-person skit.

398
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
One person skit? That's great.

399
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
I have something to tell you.

400
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
No, no, no.

401
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Please take a look at it.

402
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Matsumoto, please.

403
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Today is my first date with him.

404
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
But will he really come?

405
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
I'm worried.

406
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
This is the meeting place with him.

407
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
It's in front of Shinjuku Arutama.

408
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
He's late.

409
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
When will he come?

410
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Will he come?

411
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
I found his white Camaro.

412
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Dear.

413
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
He's coming, he's coming.

414
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
This is his apartment.

415
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:52,000
He's coming, he's coming.
