1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hello.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
What are you doing here?

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
It's really cold.

4
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Today is the first time I came to Shinjuku.

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Look at this.

6
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
This is a book store.

7
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
It's being sold very well.

8
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Really?

9
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
The person who was wearing the clothes is also...

10
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
No, no, no.

11
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
It's the person who was wearing the clothes.

12
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I see.

13
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Take a look at this.

14
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Last New Car.

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
The story of the sea in the month of the 15th.

16
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The cameraman's hands are shaking.

17
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
It's amazing.

18
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
It's the first time I've been here.

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
What are you doing?

20
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Doesn't this look a bit like Hamada?

21
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Look at this.

22
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
There's a store all the time.

23
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
The cameraman is amazing.

24
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Look over there.

25
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
What?

26
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Boys Massage Plaza.

27
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Oh, oh, oh.

28
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
If you listen to the story earlier,

29
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
It's a male version of Souplan.

30
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
When you go there, there are beautiful boys' pictures.

31
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
You can choose this.

32
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Masato-kun, I brought you today.

33
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I brought it.

34
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I brought it.

35
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Thank you very much.

36
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Thank you very much.

37
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Go.

38
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Yeah.

39
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I want you to put it on again.

40
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
But the book store is the most surprising.

41
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
That's how...

42
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Now, now.

43
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Now, now.

44
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
It's like this.

45
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Really?

46
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
It's definitely dangerous.

47
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I finally got away from that creepy, scary place.

48
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Now.

49
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
This is the Bifran Theater.

50
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
This is today's venue.

51
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Yes.

52
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
This program is Ooyama International Products.

53
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Toyosui-san and.

54
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Sponsored by the sponsor you are watching.

55
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I'm surprised you came out suddenly.

56
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
There's usually a question.

57
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
It's a little weird.

58
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
You opened the curtain yourself.

59
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
It's unusual.

60
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Yeah.

61
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
But let's do our best for 30 minutes today.

62
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Is this the fourth time today?

63
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
That's right.

64
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I'm going to do my best on the comedy show.

65
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
It's not a good show in the world.

66
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
There's no show.

67
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
There's no show.

68
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
There's no show.

69
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
There's a lot of dark news lately.

70
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
It's all about really bad cases.

71
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Yes, yes.

72
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Recently, there was an incident where I could laugh.

73
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Inoki was added.

74
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Stupid.

75
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I can't laugh.

76
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
It seems that he held back his tears and talked for the rest of the time.

77
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
That's right.

78
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
It's scary.

79
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I want that power.

80
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
That's true.

81
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
There's no funny show on TV these days.

82
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Oh.

83
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I hate Sazae-san in the anime.

84
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
That's a little stupid.

85
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
You're the most funny man in Japan.

86
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
But it's just one pattern.

87
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Next week, Katsuo and Hanazawa-san will be done.

88
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Stupid.

89
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I can't watch it.

90
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
You did a good job like a child.

91
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:38,000
It would have been hard if Nakajima hadn't come out.

92
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
What kind of way does Nakajima come out suddenly?

93
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
He only plays baseball every day.

94
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I can't stop thinking about manga.

95
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Is that so?

96
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
It's cute.

97
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
When we were kids, we used to watch BEM.

98
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
That was interesting.

99
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Three people come out.

100
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
BEM, BEM, BEM.

101
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Yes, yes.

102
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
A family or someone I don't know.

103
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
They've been traveling all the time.

104
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
It's BEM.

105
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
BEM, BEM, BEM.

106
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
The child's voice.

107
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Yes, yes.

108
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
He becomes friends with a local child.

109
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
He's very friendly.

110
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Yes, he becomes friends.

111
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
When an incident happens, BEM transforms in front of his friend.

112
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
He's a monster.

113
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
When he transforms, his head looks like a butt.

114
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
And his body looks like Nika-Poka.

115
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
He puts his butt in here.

116
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Yes, yes.

117
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
He goes wild.

118
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Then he goes back to the child.

119
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
He's a scary guy.

120
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Yes, he's a scary guy.

121
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Then he goes back to the child.

122
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Then he goes back to the child.

123
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Then he says to the child,

124
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I'm sorry.

125
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I lied to you.

126
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Yes.

127
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I'm not a human.

128
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I can see that.

129
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
You've been a butt all this time.

130
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
He's joking.

131
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
He's joking even more with BEM.

132
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
BEM?

133
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
BEM?

134
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
BEM?

135
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
BEM?

136
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
BEM?

137
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
BEM?

138
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
BEM?

139
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
BEM?

140
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
BEM?

141
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
BEM?

142
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
BEM?

143
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
BEM?

144
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
BEM?

145
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
BEM?

146
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
lesothia

147
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
lesothia

148
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
lesothia

149
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I'm not a human being.

150
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
You know you are.

151
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
You're inside the butt.

152
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Yes.

153
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
You think you're a human being,

154
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
but you're not.

155
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
BEM?

156
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
BEM?

157
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
BEM?

158
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
BEM?

159
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
BEM?

160
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
BEM?

161
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
BEM?

162
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
BEM?

163
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
BEM?

164
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
BEM?

165
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
BEM?

166
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
BEM?

167
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
BEM?

168
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
BEM?

169
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
BEM?

170
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
BEM?

171
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
You're wearing tights and you're so skinny!

172
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I was so angry.

173
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
You know, there are a lot of machines.

174
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Like the neck-gel-ge, the brain-gel-ge, the yago-gel-ge.

175
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
And there are a lot of other machines that can be eliminated.

176
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
The most pitiful one was the neck-gel-ge.

177
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
When the neck-gel-ge came out, the title was pitiful.

178
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
The machine neck-gel-ge peeked out of the window.

179
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
It's not a big deal.

180
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I don't think it's a big deal to get hit by a Barum-1 all the time.

181
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
It's just peeking.

182
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
The Barum-1's song.

183
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
It's a joke.

184
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
You're even talking about the song?

185
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
The song is a joke.

186
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
There are a lot of songs in the world, but it's a rare song that doesn't have that much content.

187
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
The super-human Barum-1.

188
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
It's not a big deal.

189
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:25,000
It's like the engine sound of a Barum-1 car.

190
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I don't know the meaning of this.

191
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
You're running fast.

192
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:39,000
The machine neck-gel-ge.

193
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I'm sorry about that.

194
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
You're running fast.

195
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I don't know.

196
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
When I was a kid, I thought it was fun to be fooled like that.

197
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
When I was a kid, I thought it was fun to be fooled like that.

198
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I don't know anything because I'm a kid.

199
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
You asked your parents something you didn't know.

200
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
When I was a kid, I wondered how babies were born.

201
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I can't help it.

202
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
You should ask your parents.

203
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Parents should not destroy children's dreams.

204
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Listen to me.

205
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I'm not going to tell you.

206
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
A rooster flew in from the north sky.

207
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
If you do it with your mother, you'll be born.

208
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
You're lying.

209
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
If you do it with your mother, you'll be born.

210
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
It's midnight.

211
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I don't think it's going to happen.

212
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
What's wrong with you?

213
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Your mother and the rooster went into a love hotel after a meal.

214
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I'm going to be born?

215
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Yes.

216
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
After that, your mother was combing her hair in front of the three-faced bird.

217
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,000
She said, when can I see you?

218
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
What kind of world is that?

219
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
A white rooster?

220
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
It's a blue rooster.

221
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Everyone has a dream when they're little.

222
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
That's true.

223
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
There's a lot of things.

224
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
That's right.

225
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I want to be a baseball player.

226
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
There are many baseball boys.

227
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
There are many, but it's too much.

228
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I'm a baseball player, but I'm a professional baseball player.

229
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I don't like playing baseball.

230
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I'm just throwing a ball.

231
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
There are a lot of people who want to do it.

232
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
It's the same for professional baseball, but it's amazing that it doesn't go up to one.

233
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Especially in national baseball.

234
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
It's because the ball is wide.

235
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
There are a lot of players who quit in the middle.

236
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Coach, I'm going to quit baseball.

237
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
All right, stop it.

238
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Wait, hey!

239
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Hey!

240
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
That's not it.

241
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I quit baseball.

242
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
All right, stop it.

243
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
It's a race.

244
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
If it's the coach, I won't stop it.

245
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I quit baseball.

246
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
What are you talking about?

247
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
All right, stop it.

248
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
What are you talking about?

249
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I quit baseball.

250
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:36,000
What are you talking about?

251
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
What are you doing?

252
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
What is this?

253
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
What are you doing?

254
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,000
That's why you have to be more aggressive.

255
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I can't do that.

256
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
What's that?

257
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Gak!

258
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Hahaha!

259
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Where does it come from?

260
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
You're going to do it.

261
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I'll do it.

262
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Gak!

263
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
What did you say?

264
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Coach, I'm going to quit baseball.

265
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Gak!

266
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
What are you doing?

267
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
This is the name of the guy.

268
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Convince him.

269
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
What?

270
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Convince him.

271
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
What's wrong with the engine?

272
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Stop it.

273
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Then, my father's pyjamas...

274
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I told you to stop!

275
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Why should I stop at your place and wear my father's pyjamas?

276
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I told you to stop!

277
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I didn't tell you to stop at my house!

278
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
That's why I'm persuading you.

279
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Tell me!

280
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Huh? Tell me!

281
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I don't get it.

282
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Hey, what are you talking about?

283
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Hey, you!

284
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I see.

285
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
You're the supervisor, aren't you?

286
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
What are you talking about?

287
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Look at that. What's that?

288
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
That's...

289
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
These are my pyjamas I've been wearing for the past three years,

290
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
whether it's raining or windy.

291
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
If you take them off, they'll get wet.

292
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
That's not the problem!

293
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Wait!

294
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
It doesn't matter if you take them off!

295
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I'm telling you to stop!

296
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Let's go!

297
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Stop properly!

298
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
What?

299
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I got it.

300
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
There's a lot of ways to stop.

301
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
What are you talking about?

302
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Huh?

303
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
What are you going to do about this?

304
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
It's sad and painful.

305
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
It happens to anyone.

306
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
In that case, take off your shoes.

307
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Here?

308
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Take off your shoes!

309
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
No, I quit.

310
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Take off your shoes!

311
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Take off your shoes!

312
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Take off your shoes!

313
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I want to quit baseball, so...

314
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Take off your shoes!

315
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Take off your shoes!

316
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
You're forcing yourself.

317
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
What do you mean, take off your shoes?

318
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Take off your shoes!

319
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Take off your shoes!

320
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Take off your shoes!

321
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
You're forcing yourself.

322
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
What do you mean, take off your shoes?

323
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Huh?

324
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Okay, now you can...

325
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
What are you talking about?

326
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I don't care who takes them off!

327
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Who?

328
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I don't care who takes them off!

329
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Huh?

330
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
There's a way!

331
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
If you watch TV, you can persuade them!

332
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
There is.

333
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
It's like a youth drama.

334
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Yeah.

335
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Okay.

336
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Hamada, what are you saying?

337
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I'm not saying anything.

338
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Look at the sun.

339
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
That's right.

340
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I'm telling you to do that.

341
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
What are you saying?

342
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Look at the sun.

343
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
That's right.

344
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
What?

345
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Hey, say it louder.

346
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Hamada!

347
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Yes!

348
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Look at the sun.

349
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Yes!

350
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Look at it better.

351
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Okay.

352
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
My head hurt.

353
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
It's been a while since I heard this.

354
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
It's been a while.

355
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
How long have you been doing this?

356
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
About 10 minutes?

357
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
You haven't done it for 10 minutes?

358
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Well, before I went to baseball,

359
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I did it for 5 minutes.

360
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
What?

361
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
What are you doing?

362
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I'm cleaning the mic.

363
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Oh, really?

364
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
That's weird.

365
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I didn't hear you at all.

366
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I was surprised.

367
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Hey, are you going to spill it on the staff?

368
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Say it.

369
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I'm going to do it.

370
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Hey, we didn't know that either.

371
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
It came out suddenly from the side.

372
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
This is the staff's thing, right?

373
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Someone.

374
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
They say they're on TV.

375
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
What?

376
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
It doesn't make sense.

377
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Well, this...

378
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Well, it did rain last week.

379
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
The assistant,

380
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I said,

381
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
the guy who came to the country,

382
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
and it really came out.

383
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I was deceived.

384
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I've been sitting with the makeup artist for a long time.

385
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Oh, really?

386
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I'm a makeup artist.

387
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I'm a makeup artist with a very exotic face.

388
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Let's go with this.

389
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
This person is

390
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
This person is amazing.

391
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
He's from Matsudo.

392
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Kamizawa Misako.

393
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
23 years old.

394
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Do you remember?

395
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Thank you.

396
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Please put in about three people.

397
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
What does that mean?

398
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I don't think it's a mean thing.

399
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Please put in about three people.

400
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I like Hama-chan.

401
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
That's what it is.

402
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
What kind of comment is that?

403
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
What is that?

404
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
That's good.

405
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I like the cute lower lip of Hitomi Tsuburana.

406
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I love it.

407
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Let's play together next time.

408
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
This is also

409
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Hamada's

410
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
this harsh comment.

411
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I don't know if this is right.

412
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Why?

413
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I want you to soften it a little more.

414
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
The other day, when the show was on air,

415
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
towards Mr. Koutaro Satomi,

416
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I'm sorry.

417
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I'm sorry to Mr. Koutaro Satomi of the country.

418
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
That's not it.

419
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
No.

420
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I'm nervous when I'm next to you.

421
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Why?

422
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Stop it.

423
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I want you to be more like an amateur.

424
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Oh, me?

425
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I want you to be a little more professional.

426
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
When Mr. Morio Kazama came from the other side,

427
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
he said to me,

428
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
There's a reason for the Super Cup.

429
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
That's right.

430
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Let's hear the reason.

431
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Stop it.

432
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Please.

433
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Mr. Koutaro Satomi.

434
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Stop it.

435
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
When Mr. Koutaro Satomi was on the other side of the show,

436
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
he couldn't make it to the final.

437
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
The other people on the other show

438
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
were left with about four sets of finals.

439
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
They said they'd cheer for the winner.

440
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
We went to the 800th night.

441
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
We cheered for the show.

442
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Koutaro satomi made a mistake three times in a row.

443
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Koutaro satomi.

444
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
He made a mistake.

445
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
He was on the other side of the show.

446
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
It was a fast-forward quiz.

447
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
It's good to press the button.

448
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
When Koutaro satomi was reading the question,

449
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
he was like this.

450
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Then he was like this from the side.

451
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
When I was reading the question,

452
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I put my hand on the button.

453
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
He was like this.

454
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Koutaro satomi was scared.

455
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
He was like this.

456
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
He was in a hurry.

457
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I had to press the button.

458
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
When I pressed the button,

459
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
he was like this.

460
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I didn't understand.

461
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Then he was like this.

462
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Stop it.

463
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I want you to think about it.

464
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I'll ask Mr. Kanagawa later.

465
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Please be more gentle with him.

466
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I was told that

467
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
he was a very good actor.

468
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
He often did a good job.

469
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
He hit the head of an amateur.

470
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
He was very good.

471
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
He hit the head of an amateur.

472
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
He didn't do it in a painful way.

473
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
He said something I didn't understand.

474
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
It's not common for an amateur to say that.

475
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I didn't do it.

476
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I didn't do it.

477
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
He is very good at

478
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
the Osaka TV program.

479
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
He is very good.

480
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
He was angry at the Osaka TV program.

481
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I wanted to do it to Matsumoto.

482
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
But he was scared.

483
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I was scared.

484
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I was scared.

485
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
He hit my neck.

486
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
He was angry.

487
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
He was angry even if I didn't do it.

488
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
He hit my neck.

489
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
He was angry.

490
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
He hit my neck.

491
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
He hit my neck.

492
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
He was angry.

493
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
He hit my head.

494
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I don't care.

495
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I can't do that if I was angry at the Osaka TV program.

496
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I'm very angry.

497
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Wait a minute.

498
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
There are many people who get angry.

499
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I'm angry because I'm angry

500
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
because I'm angry.

501
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
It's okay to be angry.

502
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
But you can't be angry at the Osaka TV program.

503
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
There are people who get angry at the Osaka TV program.

504
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:56,000
There is a place called Minestrone in front of the entrance.

505
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I don't know if you can say it or not.

506
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Minestrone.

507
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Minestrone?

508
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
There is a hot soup.

509
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I want to eat it.

510
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I want to eat it.

511
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I want to eat it.

512
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I want to eat it.

513
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,000
When they came in, they hit me.

514
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Minestrone hit my hand.

515
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
It's hot.

516
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
This is not good if it doesn't happen.

517
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
It's hot.

518
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:37,000
It's hot even in the middle of the airport.

519
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Minestrone's melted onion was on the pan.

520
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Look, it's hot! Half of it is hot!

521
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,000
And the feeling of an Italian who made the Minestrone!

522
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
What are you talking about?

523
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
What are you talking about?

524
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I was also surprised by that.

525
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
There are a lot of them in Harada.

526
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
There aren't many in Tokyo.

527
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I've been to Tokyo many times.

528
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Really?

529
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I've been on the train.

530
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I know that there are a lot of them.

531
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
What are they doing?

532
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
When I got off at the station,

533
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I wanted to leave the station as soon as possible.

534
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,000
There were a lot of people.

535
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
One of them hit me.

536
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
He said,

537
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
What the hell is this?

538
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
What the hell is this?

539
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I looked at him and said,

540
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
You're a really bad guy.

541
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I remember.

542
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I remember.

543
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
I remember.

544
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
When I made my debut.

545
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Don't tell me to get out of the way.

546
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
When I made my debut,

547
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I was riding a car with him in Osaka.

548
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
When I started to appear on TV,

549
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I didn't know if 100 people would notice me or not.

550
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I was driving in the middle lane.

551
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
When I stopped at the traffic light,

552
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
a kind-looking man who looked like a salaryman

553
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
looked at me and smiled at me.

554
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
He pointed at my face.

555
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,000
He was smiling at me.

556
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
He was looking at me with a salaryman's eyes.

557
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I was looking at him 3 times.

558
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
I was looking at him 5 times.

559
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I was looking at him 4 times.

560
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Are you a Kabuki?

561
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Are you a Kabuki?

562
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I really don't want to do that.

563
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:41,000
I want to be more warm-hearted like Kin-chan.

564
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
What would you do if you were angry at me?

565
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
I was angry the other day.

566
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
I was in Osaka.

567
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I was in a hurry.

568
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
I was fooled by a fool.

569
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
That's angry.

570
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,000
I have to put up with it.

571
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
I have something to tell you.

572
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
What is it?

573
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I don't want to talk about downtown on TV.

574
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I don't want to talk about downtown on TV.

575
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
I released a record.

576
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,000
I see.

577
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
You idiot.

578
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,000
You released a 5-song CD before.

579
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I did.

580
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
In October...

581
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Stop it.

582
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
If I was asked if I had a record,

583
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
if I was asked if I had a record,

584
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
I would say,

585
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
I don't have one.

586
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
I don't have a good record.

587
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
It's over.

588
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
It's over.

589
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
As you said,

590
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
I want to hear this kind of story.

591
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
I think it's okay to ask questions.

592
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
That's right.

593
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
It's my first time.

594
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
I heard this happened.

595
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Please tell me in detail.

596
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
That's good.

597
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
A girl appeared today.

598
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I was surprised.

599
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
That's amazing.

600
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
I was really surprised.

601
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
That's right.

602
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
The other day,

603
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
you didn't say the age limit.

604
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
That's right.

605
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
What is the age limit?

606
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
From what age to what age?

607
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Yes.

608
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
What do you do?

609
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Isn't this live?

610
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Yes.

611
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I don't care about the age.

612
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
That's not good.

613
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
What are you?

614
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
How old are you?

615
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
What is your strike zone?

616
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,000
What kind of strike zone is this?

617
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
I'm the assistant of the program.

618
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
The strike zone is about 15 years old.

619
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Is that so?

620
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
It's not that.

621
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
What kind of strike zone is this?

622
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
I'm over 18 years old.

623
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Over 18 years old.

624
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
20 years old.

625
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Well...

626
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
8 years old?

627
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
I think so.

628
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Are you over 8 years old?

629
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
I don't think you're over 18 years old.

630
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
There's a change here.

631
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I don't know much about people over 18 years old.

632
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
I don't care if you know or not.

633
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
I'm the assistant of the program.

634
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
That's right.

635
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Let's say you're 18 years old.

636
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
That's not good.

637
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Let's say you're 30 years old.

638
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
I don't care if I'm 30 years old.

639
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Let's say you're over 18 years old.

640
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
I'm the assistant of the program.

641
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
From 18 years old to 30 years old.

642
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
30 years old.

643
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
That's a lot.

644
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
From 18 years old to 30 years old.

645
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
That's a lot.

646
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
From 18 years old to 30 years old.

647
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Let's say you're over 45 years old.

648
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Let's say you're over 50 years old.

649
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
I'll introduce you next week.

650
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Thank you.

651
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Thank you.
