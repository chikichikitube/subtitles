1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
In the 1st episode of Gaki no Tsukaya, we have the staff of Chikishiki Beauty Otose, Kudoki Tekugasse!

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Today, we have the staff of Kudoki Tekugasse.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I see.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
He's from the industry, so he should be very good at seducing women.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
And he likes women.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
He likes women.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
He's from the industry.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
That's right. So today, I wonder what the men on TV will say.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I see. I've never seen a woman like this before.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
It's like a model.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I see.

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
That's what I wanted to show in the opening.

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I see.

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
In that sense, the people sitting over there are the staff.

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
They're sleeping lions.

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
They're sleeping lions.

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
But Mr. Matsumoto, the person on the far left is sleeping.

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
That's right.

19
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
The staff of Kudoki Tekugasse, Kudoki Tekugasse.

20
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Ouch.

21
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
This program is brought to you by the following sponsors.

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
First, we meet at the hook.

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
We meet.

24
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
We meet and we try to get her to come over for a cup of tea.

25
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
We take her out for a drink.

26
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
We take her out for a drink.

27
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
And then from here...

28
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The last one is this way.

29
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
We have to take her to our room.

30
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
There's a bed.

31
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
That's right.

32
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
There's nothing in the room.

33
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
But I think there are two steps.

34
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I see.

35
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I took her to my room.

36
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
It's a problem until she comes here.

37
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
It's probably impossible for her to come here suddenly.

38
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
That's right.

39
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
This is what you usually do.

40
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
It's okay if you do it.

41
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
It doesn't matter if you don't do it.

42
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Mr. Matsumoto.

43
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Yes.

44
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Top batter.

45
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
That's right.

46
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I was thinking about who to choose.

47
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
This is Mr. Yamazaki.

48
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I see.

49
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
This is Mr. Yamazaki.

50
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I think it's best to teach her.

51
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I see.

52
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Let's go to the top batter, Mr. Yamazaki.

53
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Ready.

54
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
What are you doing?

55
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Do you know me?

56
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I don't know you.

57
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I don't know you.

58
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
It's dirty.

59
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Do you know Downtown?

60
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Downtown.

61
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Haven't you seen that kid?

62
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Haven't you seen him?

63
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I've seen him, but I don't know him.

64
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
He was cheering.

65
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
That's me.

66
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Is that so?

67
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Don't you want to go for a drink?

68
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
A little.

69
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Just a little.

70
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Just a little.

71
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Just a little.

72
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Come here.

73
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Come here.

74
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
You're beautiful.

75
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Don't look at me like that.

76
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I'm not looking at you.

77
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I'm not looking at you.

78
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Don't look at me.

79
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I'm going home.

80
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I'm not worried about you.

81
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Why?

82
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I'm not worried about you.

83
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I'm not worried about you.

84
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I don't need to worry about you.

85
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I'm serious.

86
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
It's polite.

87
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
It's not polite.

88
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I'm serious.

89
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I'm not worried about you.

90
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I'm serious.

91
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Really?

92
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I'm serious.

93
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Just a little.

94
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Just a little.

95
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Let's play a game of cards.

96
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
If you take this card...

97
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I don't want to.

98
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
What?

99
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I don't want to.

100
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
You're going to say something weird.

101
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I'm not going to say anything weird.

102
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Your eyes are like that.

103
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I don't want to.

104
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I don't want to.

105
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
You don't have to do anything.

106
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
You don't have to do anything.

107
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Go over there.

108
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I'm drunk.

109
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I'm not drunk.

110
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Suddenly.

111
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Just a little.

112
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I'm not going to say anything.

113
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I'm not going to say anything.

114
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I'm not going to say anything.

115
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I'm going home.

116
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Why?

117
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
This is the worst.

118
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
This is the worst.

119
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
This is the worst.

120
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
This is the worst.

121
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I'm going to do it.

122
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
This is the worst.

123
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
This is a big deal

124
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
No.2 batter

125
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Next is Otomo

126
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Otomo

127
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
What?

128
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I don't know

129
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Have you met him before?

130
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
No

131
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
You've met him before

132
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Have you met him before?

133
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
No

134
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Can I ask you something?

135
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
What?

136
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I don't know

137
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Can I ask you something?

138
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
What?

139
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Can I ask you something?

140
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
He's laughing

141
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Sit down

142
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I'm here

143
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Can I ask you something?

144
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
What are you doing?

145
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I have something to do

146
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I'm waiting

147
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I have something to show you

148
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
It's a bad thing

149
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I have something to show you

150
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
It's not a bad thing

151
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I have something to show you

152
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I'm just drinking

153
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I have something like this

154
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Are you playing alone?

155
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I don't play alone

156
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Are you not holding it?

157
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I'm not holding it

158
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Do you want to do it?

159
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Show me your hand

160
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Can I see your hand?

161
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Can I see it?

162
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Yes

163
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Can I see your hand?

164
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Yes

165
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Wait

166
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
He's laughing

167
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
He's laughing

168
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
He's laughing a lot

169
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
How is it?

170
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
It's an adult mood

171
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I think it has more tempo

172
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Yes

173
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
It has more appeal

174
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
In that sense

175
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
It's a good thing

176
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Good morning

177
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
What are you saying?

178
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
What are you saying?

179
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Oscar

180
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
No

181
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
This is a special edition

182
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
No

183
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I can't go to the industry

184
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I can't go to the industry

185
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Are you a model?

186
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Just a little

187
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Right?

188
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Yes

189
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
There is a special edition

190
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Sit down

191
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Let's play rock-paper-scissors

192
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
What is it?

193
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
What is it?

194
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Let's play rock-paper-scissors

195
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I don't want to do it

196
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Let's play a game

197
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I don't like games

198
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Let's play rock-paper-scissors

199
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Hamada

200
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Are you two friends?

201
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I raised them

202
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I'll be your assistant

203
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Go to my room

204
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Why?

205
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Look at the calendar

206
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I forgot the date

207
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Let's go

208
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Thank you

209
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Let's go

210
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Why are you going home?

211
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I don't know

212
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
What is this?

213
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I'm going to smoke

214
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
You smell good

215
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
No

216
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I don't smell good

217
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I don't smell good

218
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I don't think so

219
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I'm just looking for a model

220
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I'm just an agent of the model

221
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
What is your occupation?

222
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I'm a model

223
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Really?

224
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I'd like to talk to you about the contract

225
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,000
and join the actors' world

226
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
OK

227
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Do you like it?

228
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Let's talk about it in the bar

229
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Who's coming?

230
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
What is your name?

231
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Lucy

232
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Where are you from?

233
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I'm from Thailand

234
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
That's cool

235
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Do you like it?

236
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
It's not always cold

237
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
The last one

238
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I'd like to talk to you about the contract

239
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
and join the actors' world

240
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
He said

241
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Let's go

242
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Hello

243
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Hello

244
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Nice to meet you

245
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Nice to meet you

246
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Where do you come from?

247
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I come from Ireland

248
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Are you lonely?

249
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Let's drink together

250
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
OK

251
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Just a small drink

252
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Who are you talking to?

253
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
What would you like to drink?

254
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I'll have lemonade

255
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Lemonade?

256
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Is it your country?

257
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Yes

258
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I like America

259
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
and Japan

260
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Are you a Japanese boy?

261
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I have a boyfriend

262
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
You have a boyfriend?

263
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Your English is very good

264
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Very good

265
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Thank you very much

266
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Are you a student?

267
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Yes, I'm a student

268
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
My home is near

269
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Really?

270
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Let's drink together

271
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
OK

272
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Just a short drink

273
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Please

274
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Please

275
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Please

276
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Thank you

277
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
You can sit there

278
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Finish, stop

279
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
You can get somebody else to do this

280
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
What?

281
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Heibo-san is angry

282
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
He's the worst

283
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
He's so cool

284
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
He's angry even though he can speak

285
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Ladies and gentlemen

286
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Why?

287
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I'm so sweaty

288
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
It's hot

289
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
It's hot

290
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I don't want to be sweaty

291
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Women can be sweaty

292
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
But this man...

293
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
He's good at it

294
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
There are a lot of women

295
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I don't know about women

296
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
But men are good at

297
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:23,000
the tightness of their thighs

298
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
This is...

299
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
And it's itchy

300
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
It's itchy

301
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
It's itchy when you roll

302
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
But you're a trunks

303
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
That's why it's itchy

304
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
What?

305
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
What?

306
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
You have a lot of hair

307
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I don't have enough hair

308
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
So it's itchy

309
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I think trunks are itchy

310
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Right?

311
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
There are a lot of people like this

312
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
It's itchy

313
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
You can't do this

314
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I remember that

315
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Trunks are itchy

316
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
You can't do this

317
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
So it's itchy

318
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
It's itchy

319
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Are you an old man?

320
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
It's not itchy

321
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
It's itchy sometimes

322
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
You can't control your body

323
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I can do it

324
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
No

325
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
When I was wearing a jersey

326
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I was doing this

327
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I thought I was finished

328
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
But when I relaxed

329
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
My body went down

330
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
And my trunks were like this

331
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
You don't have trunks

332
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
You don't have trunks

333
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
But when my trunks went up, it was itchy

334
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
It's like Yakuzan

335
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Do you know that?

336
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
No

337
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
When I was washing my face

338
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
There was a person who was doing it

339
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I was doing it

340
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
It was over

341
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:20,000
He was like this

342
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I was like, that's enough

343
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
It's not over

344
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Then he went back

345
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
It's a cataract

346
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
What is that?

347
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
There is a cataract in a cat

348
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
It's a cataract

349
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
It hurts

350
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
That's why I try to shake it

351
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
You can't shake it that much

352
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I can't shake it that much

353
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
How should I say it

354
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
There are people like me

355
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
What are you talking about?

356
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
There are times when I do it

357
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
What kind of times?

358
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
When I'm pooping

359
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
When I'm pooping

360
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
No one is there

361
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
If someone comes in

362
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I don't know why I'm holding my breath

363
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I know that

364
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Why am I a lowly person?

365
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Everyone is like that

366
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Why are you hiding?

367
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
If I do it now, I can do it in one go

368
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
If I do it now, I can do it in one go

369
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I can't even use the toilet paper

370
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I can't even use the toilet paper

371
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I really hate that

372
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
When I'm alone

373
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I'm like this

374
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I'm like this

375
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
When I'm alone

376
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I'm like this

377
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I'm like this

378
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I'm like this

379
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I know that

380
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,000
But sometimes I'm like a man in the sea

381
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I fall in love

382
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
A man falls in love with a man

383
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I want to go out and wait

384
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
In charge ofidol

385
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
In charge ofidol

386
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
To become a children

387
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:15,000
To become a children

388
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
What do we learn?

389
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I have a little face

390
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I have a little face

391
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Help me

392
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Narrow it

393
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Narrow it

394
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I was thinking of a different Hamada-san.

395
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
When I said, Oh, I got it!

396
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I was like, Oh, I got it!

397
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
That's right, that's right.

398
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I was thinking of a different Hamada-san.

399
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
That's right, that's right.

400
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Even if you say it, 24 hours have passed.

401
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Ah, that's right.

402
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Are you still looking for a letter?

403
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I heard that a lot of people came.

404
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Really?

405
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I heard that a lot of people came.

406
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I heard that only those who have done it before choose.

407
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Oh, really?

408
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
What should I do?

409
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I'm fine with saying that, but...

410
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
In a sense, it may be harder than a ostrich.

411
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Well, it's a different nature.

412
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
And it's like ostriches.

413
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,000
If the camera chases you for 24 hours and tells you to do your best.

414
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
That's worth it.

415
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
It's worth it.

416
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I'm not doing it for anyone.

417
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I won't tell you to do your best.

418
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I won't send you a fax.

419
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I won't send you a fax.

420
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
What should I do?

421
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Who are you asking?

422
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Let's say you fall down.

423
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
What would you do?

424
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I'll do it like this.

425
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
It's really hard.

426
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I can do an impersonation show even if you fall down.

427
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
It's really hard.

428
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I'm really good at Senma Sao.

429
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Is that a croquette?

430
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Is Senma Sao doing a croquette?

431
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
No, I'm Senma Sao.

432
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
It's a croquette.

433
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I've been doing impersonations for a long time.

434
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:02,000
It's an automatic vending machine at a cashier.

435
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
It's like an automatic vending machine.

436
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
It's like a vending machine.

437
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
It's like a vending machine.

438
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
It's like a vending machine.

439
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
It's really similar.

440
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
What about my money?

441
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:20,000
What are you doing?

442
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
What is the small window on the corner of the toilet door?

443
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
What does it mean?

444
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Where is it?

445
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
It used to be like this.

446
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Wasn't it around here?

447
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:48,000
It's not attached to the ventilation.

448
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
It's for ventilation.

449
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
It stinks.

450
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
It's not for ventilation?

451
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
It's not for ventilation.

452
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
But I need it.

453
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I don't know.

454
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
You don't know?

455
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I don't know.

456
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Why is it attached?

457
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I want you to tell me.

458
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I can tell you.

459
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
At night,

460
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,000
everyone in the house is sleeping,

461
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
so if I don't open the window,

462
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
the poop that was playing outside...

463
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Is that really true?

464
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Yes, it's true.

465
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
What?

466
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Yes, it's true.

467
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Why are you talking about old people?

468
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Are you talking about old people?

469
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Don't tell me you bought it.

470
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Don't make a fool out of me.

471
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Everyone thinks so.

472
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Let's study one by one like this.

473
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
You can't reach my world yet, can you?

474
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Well, yes.

475
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
One by one.

476
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
That's true.

477
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Is that so?

478
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Yes, I'll study it.

479
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
In the survey,

480
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
which one do you think is the sexiest?

481
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
When I saw the survey,

482
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Matsumoto-san was in the first place.

483
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,000
How can I be sexy?

484
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
You should have told me.

485
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
How can I be sexy?

486
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Well,

487
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
the audience who came here last year,

488
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,000
85% of them are my fans.

489
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Well,

490
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:32,000
I think most of the fans will notice it.

491
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I don't want to say this because most of the fans noticed it.

492
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
I'm talking to you like this,

493
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
and I'm thinking you're concentrating on this.

494
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
But it's time to emphasize the urn.

495
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
It happened, didn't it?

496
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
It happened before.

497
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
It didn't happen.

498
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Wait a minute, I don't have a head right now.

499
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I think the people around here noticed.

500
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
This is the first time you've done this.

501
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Happy birthday to you.

502
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Happy birthday to you.

503
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Happy birthday, Yamada-chan.

504
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Happy birthday to you.

505
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
I'm in a bath right now.

506
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
I hope I don't get in your way.

507
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Thank you very much.

508
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:41,000
