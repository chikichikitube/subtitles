1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The next day

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Father!

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Father!

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Father!

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Father!

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Father!

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Father!

8
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Why?

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Why?

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
In the first episode of Daki no Tsukai,

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Machan got hurt!

12
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Right?

13
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Every time.

14
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Machan had a hard time before, but this time he got hit in the face during a TV shoot and his face got swollen.

15
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
He couldn't show his face in front of everyone.

16
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:01,000
So I'm going to show you a chiki-chiki video.

17
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:08,000
First of all, let me show you the opening of the chiki-chiki race.

18
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Until then, I went to the venue and walked around the nearby road.

19
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
This is the first chiki-chiki race with a title.

20
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:32,000
This is the first chiki-chiki race with a title.

21
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
This is the opening of the chiki-chiki race.

22
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Today, I'm working on the machine.

23
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Mr. Matsumoto, please show me.

24
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
How are you doing?

25
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Are you sweating?

26
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Chiki-chiki is a gentleman's sport in the United States.

27
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Mr. Matsumoto, please show me.

28
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Mr. Matsumoto, please show me.

29
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Mr. Matsumoto, please show me.

30
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Mr. Matsumoto, please show me.

31
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
What are you doing?

32
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Mr. Matsumoto, please show me.

33
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Mr. Matsumoto, please show me.

34
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Mr. Matsumoto, please show me.

35
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I can't reach it.

36
00:03:52,000 --> 00:04:02,000
It's really hard.

37
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Who is this person?

38
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I'm sorry.

39
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Mr. Matsumoto, please show me.

40
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
We can't speak English.

41
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I want to speak, but I can't.

42
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I'm your Geos.

43
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
A lesson to speak.

44
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Geos of conversation.

45
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Oh, no.

46
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
It wasn't in. Bright.

47
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I'll put it in now. Bright.

48
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Light and bright for coffee.

49
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
It's light and light.

50
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Isn't it?

51
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
A good international phone.

52
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
0061

53
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
In addition, we have a good discount service.

54
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
For example, Merit 10

55
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
It's a 9.5% discount.

56
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
An international phone.

57
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
0061

58
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Attractive 10-color color pochette

59
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Today color group pochette

60
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
From the colorful Honda Primo

61
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Did you get hit again?

62
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
The 13th time.

63
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
It's been a long time.

64
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
The authentic taste of the north.

65
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Well, that's right.

66
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Cool figure.

67
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I've seen a manly figure.

68
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Now, let's continue.

69
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Let's buy a lot of Chiki Chiki.

70
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
We went to various stores separately.

71
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I'm going to buy something for less than 100,000 yen.

72
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I did it.

73
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
When?

74
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
90 years.

75
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I don't remember.

76
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Is it okay?

77
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Take this 10,000 yen.

78
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Buy 10kg of things.

79
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Buy 10kg of things.

80
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
10,000 yen.

81
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I wonder if there's a 10kg woman.

82
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
That's not what it means.

83
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
How many kilograms is this?

84
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
It's a house.

85
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
What are you talking about?

86
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
It's funny.

87
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
But...

88
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
It's a house.

89
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
How many kilograms is your father?

90
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
First of all, please give me one.

91
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
What did you buy?

92
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Hey.

93
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
What is this?

94
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Do you have a receipt?

95
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I don't have it.

96
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I don't know.

97
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Why?

98
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I don't get receipts on Japanese TV.

99
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I bought it myself.

100
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I really like it.

101
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Stop it.

102
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
That's a bullet.

103
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
What is it?

104
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
What is it?

105
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Cat sand.

106
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
It's a stuffed animal.

107
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I don't need it.

108
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Stop it.

109
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Stop it.

110
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
It won't move.

111
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
The reason why I was late.

112
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
This guy suddenly jumped out.

113
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
It's like a Japanese bridge.

114
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,000
It's hard to catch a Japanese bridge.

115
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I can't catch a Japanese bridge.

116
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
It's true.

117
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Let's measure it.

118
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
How much is it?

119
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
It feels good.

120
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
It's 7.5.

121
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
It's 9.5.

122
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
It's a snack.

123
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
It's a dryer.

124
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I don't need it.

125
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Will it move?

126
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I don't know.

127
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Put it on.

128
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Hey.

129
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Don't step on it.

130
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
It's 10 kilograms.

131
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
10 kilograms.

132
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Hey.

133
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
It's not moving.

134
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Hey.

135
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
What?

136
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
It's 6 kilograms.

137
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Let's go.

138
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Okay.

139
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Hey.

140
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
It's over.

141
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
It's over.

142
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
It's gone.

143
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
It's gone.

144
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
It's gone.

145
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
It's gone.

146
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
It's 10 kilograms.

147
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
It's true.

148
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I'm glad there were only two.

149
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
It's a face of a joke.

150
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Hey.

151
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I won.

152
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:26,000
It says 5 kilograms.

153
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Next.

154
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I don't like my body.

155
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
What is this?

156
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
You don't like your body?

157
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Look at it.

158
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
It's blue.

159
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I don't like my body.

160
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
It will run around the shopping street.

161
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
You run away.

162
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Hey.

163
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
You are very fast.

164
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
You run away.

165
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I know you don't like it.

166
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I'll chase you.

167
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Go.

168
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Hey.

169
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
What are you doing?

170
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:08,000
This is very cool.

171
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Where are you now?

172
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I'm here.

173
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Hey.

174
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I'm here.

175
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
You are a fool.

176
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I don't like my body.

177
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:54,000
It's going down.

178
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Where is the guy in a strange costume?

179
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Hey.

180
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Hurry up.

181
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Hurry up.

182
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:24,000
You are very fast.

183
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:36,000
You run away.

184
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I don't like my body.

185
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Wait.

186
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Where are you now?

187
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I don't like my body.

188
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I don't like my body.

189
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Hey.

190
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Where are you now?

191
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I don't like my body.

192
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:53,000
My sons are very bad.

193
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I'll go.

194
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I'll go.

195
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Hey.

196
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Hey.

197
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I think I prepared dinner.

198
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
What are you going to eat tonight?

199
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I'm going to eat a hamburger.

200
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Don't be shy.

201
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Hey.

202
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Hey.

203
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Hey.

204
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
What did you eat tonight?

205
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I'm going to eat a hamburger.

206
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Don't be shy.

207
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Don't be shy.

208
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
What are you going to eat tonight?

209
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I think I prepared dinner.

210
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
What are you going to eat tonight?

211
00:12:49,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I'm going to eat a hamburger.

212
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I'm going to eat a hamburger.

213
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I think you can make me a snack.

214
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
What is that?

215
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Snack?

216
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
My recent snack is this.

217
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I put a page on it.

218
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Do you know why I put it here?

219
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I hate boring stories.

220
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Don't be silly.

221
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Don't you think so?

222
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Next work.

223
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Let's shoot a movie.

224
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,200
What is it, Oto-san?

225
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:37,700
What?

226
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:41,200
What is it? What is your favorite word?

227
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:44,300
Well, I love the Giant Army, so...

228
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:48,000
Like Nakashima-senshi said, the Giant Army will never die.

229
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:48,500
Right?

230
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,500
Did you just say that?

231
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,200
What do you mean, right?

232
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,600
Yoshio!

233
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,400
What is it, Oto-sama?

234
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,500
What is it? Yoshio, what is your favorite word?

235
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:07,500
Well, I'm a genius, so when a genius forgets, it comes back.

236
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,500
Like this, it's not a big deal, though.

237
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,500
Thank you very much.

238
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,500
It's good that it was quick.

239
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,500
Waruo!

240
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,000
What is it?

241
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:19,800
What is it?

242
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:20,500
Waruo.

243
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,500
What is it, Tabitabi?

244
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,500
Tabitabi?

245
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
What is it? What is your favorite word?

246
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:25,500
Huh?

247
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,000
What is your favorite word?

248
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,500
It's not that.

249
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:31,500
Well, it's not that, but it's a favorite word.

250
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,500
Kamishihougatame.

251
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
That's a good one.

252
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,000
It's a favorite word.

253
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,500
It's a four-letter word.

254
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
A four-letter word?

255
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:45,000
Like, gaden, gaden-insui.

256
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,500
It's a four-letter word like that.

257
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,000
Daisuke Hanako.

258
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,500
Now, the next one.

259
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,000
What is it?

260
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,500
What is your favorite word?

261
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,500
Now, the next one is,

262
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,500
Grandfather and Grandmother Hide-and-seek.

263
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,500
Mr. Tokujirou Namikoshi and his aunt Komori

264
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:06,500
are the guests of Grandfather and Grandmother.

265
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,500
They've come all the way here,

266
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:11,500
and they've hidden themselves in a horrible place.

267
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,500
It's like this show, though.

268
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,500
They don't really treat the guests well.

269
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,500
Okay, Hanako.

270
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,500
I've set everything up for you guys.

271
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:21,000
Okay.

272
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
First of all, you don't know this.

273
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:23,500
Really?

274
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:26,500
Even though I've been a veteran detective for 50 years,

275
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:29,500
I've never been able to follow this path.

276
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,500
Really?

277
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,000
Yes.

278
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,500
Now, let's go.

279
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,500
If you get it, you'll get it right away.

280
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,500
I don't think he's found yet.

281
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:48,500
There are people like this at the station sometimes.

282
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:51,500
Grandfather and Grandmother Hide-and-seek.

283
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,500
He doesn't want to do it.

284
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,500
This guy.

285
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,500
I get it.

286
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,500
I'm sorry.

287
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,500
I'm sorry.

288
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,500
Do you want me to do it?

289
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,500
Well, he likes it, so leave it alone.

290
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:14,500
But I couldn't stop him from going this way.

291
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,500
This is really funny.

292
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,500
It's Konori's grandmother.

293
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,500
Grandmother.

294
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,500
What?

295
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:28,500
I wonder what he does when he wakes up in the morning.

296
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:32,500
It can't be a male toilet, can it?

297
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:35,500
It can't be a male toilet, can it?

298
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,500
What are you doing?

299
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,500
What are you doing?

300
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,500
What are you doing?

301
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:49,500
Grandmother, it's like you've got a pattern.

302
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,500
Grandmother.

303
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,500
Grandmother is a celebrity.

304
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:58,500
Grandmother, it's like you've got a pattern.

305
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:01,500
Grandmother, it's like you've got a pattern.

306
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,500
Here we are.

307
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:05,500
It's called Chiki Chiki Nozohime.

308
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:08,500
This is a song that you two like.

309
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:12,500
It's 10 songs each.

310
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,500
Nozohime did it.

311
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,500
It's funny.

312
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:24,500
Masumoto-kun is very enthusiastic about GALANTE.

313
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,500
Let's take a look.

314
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:31,500
First of all, Mr. Yoshida.

315
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:38,500
And the performer is Mr. Ryodo Yokomori.

316
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:46,500
I'm sorry, but I'm crazy about you.

317
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:50,500
GALANTE, GALANTE.

318
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,500
It's funny.

319
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:58,500
I'm crazy about you.

320
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:10,500
You left without saying a word.

321
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:17,500
I'm laughing at the past.

322
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:24,500
I wish I could hate you.

323
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:27,500
I like you after all.

324
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,500
Yoshida.

325
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,500
I was confident.

326
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,500
I put in too much emotion.

327
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:40,500
What's wrong with you?

328
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:45,500
You didn't become your own.

329
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,500
The impersonation went ahead.

330
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,500
I see.

331
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,500
That's good.

332
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,500
I see.

333
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:54,500
Who is it? Who is it? Who is it?

334
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:58,500
The shadow of the night beyond the sky.

335
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:04,500
The gacha man with white wings.

336
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:16,500
The gacha man with white wings.

337
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,500
I'll sing until the end.

338
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:26,500
You're a man, aren't you?

339
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:31,500
You have to live strong.

340
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:40,500
Don't worry about me.

341
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:44,500
I'm praying.

342
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,500
Yoshida.

343
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,500
I can't do it by myself.

344
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:53,500
It's the first time I've heard it.

345
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,500
I don't want to be masturbated.

346
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:58,500
Did you know we were recording?

347
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:01,500
Really?

348
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:05,500
I think this is new to everyone.

349
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:10,500
We're going to visit the Yamazaki family.

350
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,500
It was hard at the time.

351
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,500
Hello.

352
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:24,500
Hello.

353
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,500
I heard you moved.

354
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:29,500
I brought you a cake as a souvenir.

355
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,500
Thank you.

356
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:32,500
Let's eat.

357
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:38,500
I'm worried about the direction of the house you moved to.

358
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:39,500
That's right.

359
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:44,500
In the real world, I'm calling the most famous person.

360
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,500
Please come in.

361
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,500
Teacher.

362
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,500
This is the room I moved to.

363
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,500
This is terrible.

364
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,500
What?

365
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:55,500
You can't do this.

366
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,500
Everyone's on it.

367
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:00,500
I told you not to do it.

368
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:03,500
This is bad.

369
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,500
You can't do this.

370
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,500
Everyone can't do this?

371
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:09,500
I told you not to do it.

372
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:12,500
There's an attachment to your body.

373
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:13,500
Don't do it.

374
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,500
Listen to me.

375
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:35,500
Thank you very much.

376
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,500
Thank you very much.

377
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,500
Good luck.

378
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:45,500
Thank you very much.

379
00:21:45,500 --> 00:22:11,500
Let's go to the doctor's office.

380
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,500
Thank you very much.

381
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:38,500
Thank you very much.

382
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:39,500
Thank you very much.

383
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,500
Please come again.

384
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:44,500
We'll go home together.

385
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:47,500
I'll come again next week.

386
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:51,500
I'll be back in three weeks.

387
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,500
How was it?

388
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:56,500
As I said last time,

389
00:22:56,500 --> 00:23:00,500
I think there are many people who saw it after the time changed.

390
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:03,500
If you haven't seen it before,

391
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:07,500
I'm sure you've seen it.

392
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:11,500
Masumoto will appear with a beautiful face.

393
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,500
Thank you very much for tonight.

394
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:38,500
Goodbye until this time tomorrow.
