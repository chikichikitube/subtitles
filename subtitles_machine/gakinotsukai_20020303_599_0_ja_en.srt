1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Next, Matsumoto Yamasaki vs. Kokoriko.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The budget is 1000 yen.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
The Gekuman Cooking Contest!

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
As the title says, today we are a team.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
We are divided into two teams.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Cooking Contest.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
The title is 1000 yen.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
1000 yen!

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
The budget is 1000 yen.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Now, we will be having a competition in this shopping district.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
And at the end, you cook for me.

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
And I eat.

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
And you say, it's good!

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
It's good!

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I'll eat this one too!

16
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I'll be in trouble if I keep warming up.

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Oh, really?

18
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I'll be like, let's do this, let's do this.

19
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
That's fine anytime.

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It's not like a school.

21
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'll be like, should I go crazy?

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'll be like, go crazy.

23
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
You won't lose, right?

24
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'll never lose.

25
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
This is omurice.

26
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Oh.

27
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Omurice.

28
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I can't say anything anymore.

29
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I already said it.

30
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
You're an idiot.

31
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I can't say anything.

32
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I can't say anything.

33
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I can't say anything.

34
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
This program was provided by the sponsors you see.

35
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I'm weak.

36
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I can't say anything.

37
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I can't say anything.

38
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Then, let's go.

39
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Alright.

40
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Let's go.

41
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Let's go.

42
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Well, I can't say anything about this omurice.

43
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I don't know if I'll go home or not.

44
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'll keep it a secret.

45
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Just the two of us.

46
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Look, look.

47
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
There's no way he's hungry.

48
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
That's because of the ingredients.

49
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I see, I see.

50
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
What's wrong?

51
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
What's wrong?

52
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
What's wrong?

53
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I'm sorry.

54
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
What?

55
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I'm sorry.

56
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
What's wrong?

57
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
What's wrong?

58
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
What's wrong?

59
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I have a stomachache.

60
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
A stomachache?

61
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
What?

62
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
You have a stomachache?

63
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Are you okay?

64
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I don't know what's going on.

65
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I'm sorry.

66
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I have a stomachache.

67
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
That's right.

68
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Really?

69
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Can you wait a bit?

70
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I'll take you.

71
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Are you sure?

72
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I can't do it if you don't do that.

73
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
What's with you?

74
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
You looked fine earlier.

75
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Please give me a little time. I'll do something.

76
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
What?

77
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Yes, I'll do something.

78
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
What?

79
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Tanaka is fine too.

80
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Really?

81
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Let's continue.

82
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Where do we start?

83
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Let's start from where we left off.

84
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
So, we're going to start with the first team.

85
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
What are you going to make?

86
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I'm going to make rice omelette.

87
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Rice omelette is the best.

88
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I'll decide what I want to make.

89
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
What about Tanaka?

90
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
We haven't decided yet.

91
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
What is it?

92
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Can I ask you to do something?

93
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I'm going to buy some soup.

94
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
You're going to buy soup?

95
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
What is this?

96
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
What is this?

97
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I bought it!

98
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
The team that bought it first bought tofu!

99
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I see.

100
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
What about the team that bought it last?

101
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
We definitely need this.

102
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
What? What? What?

103
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Chicken.

104
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Ah, chicken!

105
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
That's right.

106
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
We have something to buy too.

107
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Really?

108
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I'll take it.

109
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Then, the Kogoriko team too.

110
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
85 yen.

111
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
It's cheap.

112
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
The chicken is really cheap.

113
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
You're really good.

114
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
You're from a normal team.

115
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Stop it.

116
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I'll go look for a pork team.

117
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I've been looking for it for a long time.

118
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
It's really cheap.

119
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
The Kogoriko team.

120
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
There it is.

121
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
The cheapest one?

122
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
The cheapest one.

123
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
It's not like the taste of the stomach.

124
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
It's different.

125
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Did you find the Â¥114?

126
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
This is fine.

127
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Ok, I found it. Â¥114 is cheap.

128
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
It's like a hidden taste.

129
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
It's a big voice.

130
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
It's good.

131
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
It's good.

132
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
It's a hidden taste.

133
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Really? Hidden taste?

134
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I'll go with the sweet one.

135
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Okay, I'll go with the sweet one.

136
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
What should we do?

137
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
There's a cheap one.

138
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
But we don't need you.

139
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
No, it's fine.

140
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
It's me.

141
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Hey, Yama-chan.

142
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Here it is.

143
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
What's wrong?

144
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
What's wrong?

145
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Here it is.

146
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
What is it?

147
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I can't move.

148
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
What?

149
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I did it.

150
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I'm surprised.

151
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
You want it?

152
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Really?

153
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Really, really, really.

154
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
It's still a wine.

155
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:37,500
I'm sorry.

156
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,000
You are not good at it.

157
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I was bad at it.

158
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
You were bad at it.

159
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
You hurt a little in the previous match.

160
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I have a habit of it.

161
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Really?

162
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
It hurts?

163
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
It hurts.

164
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I can't move.

165
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I'm sorry.

166
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I'm sorry, Samu-san.

167
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Zaki-san, are you okay?

168
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I bought wine.

169
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I'm sorry.

170
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I'm sorry.

171
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Sorry.

172
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Are you okay?

173
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I'm sorry.

174
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I'm sorry.

175
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I'm sorry.

176
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
What?

177
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I'm sorry.

178
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Zaki-san, are you okay?

179
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Like the other day?

180
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
No, no, no.

181
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Excuse me, wait.

182
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

183
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Take him away.

184
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Hey, hey, hey.

185
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Hurry up and come here.

186
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Zaki-san.

187
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Zaki-san, are you okay?

188
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Zaki-san.

189
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Soga-chan, what are you going to do?

190
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I'm in trouble.

191
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Please give me a little time. I'll do something.

192
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Really?

193
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Yes. Please wait a moment.

194
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Let's go.

195
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Yamazaki! Yamazaki!

196
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Please wait a moment.

197
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Yamazaki, it's okay.

198
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Let's go.

199
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
You're being filmed by the product, right?

200
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
The 3 of us.

201
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Is it okay?

202
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
You're using the hidden camera properly?

203
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Yes, I'm using the hidden camera.

204
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I did it!

205
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Our team...

206
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I want to buy it at the drugstore.

207
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Really?

208
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Let's go to Yaoya next time.

209
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Yaoya, yes.

210
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
What was it?

211
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Yaoya...

212
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Ah, there it is.

213
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Then I'll go there.

214
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Let's go.

215
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Welcome!

216
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Ah, I see.

217
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I haven't eaten yet.

218
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Yes, yes, yes.

219
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
What did you eat?

220
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Ah, onion and...

221
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
What?

222
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Masuo-san.

223
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I'll go there.

224
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Onion and...

225
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Yes.

226
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I'll go there.

227
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Onion, onion.

228
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Ah...

229
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I feel sick.

230
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Are you okay?

231
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I feel sick.

232
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Are you okay?

233
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Yes.

234
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Are you okay?

235
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Are you okay?

236
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
What?

237
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I'm fine.

238
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I'm fine.

239
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
It's hard.

240
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
It's a break-up.

241
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Please give me a little time. I'll do something.

242
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I'll do something.

243
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I'll buy eggs.

244
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Tanaka, Tanaka, Tanaka, Tanaka.

245
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Right, right, right, right.

246
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Ah, there it is.

247
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
It's an egg.

248
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I don't need a teacher like you.

249
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Ah, I don't need one.

250
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
This is Yamanagi Achiya.

251
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Ah, sorry.

252
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Then, I'll go with this.

253
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Ah, sorry.

254
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Onion and egg.

255
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Sorry.

256
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Hamada.

257
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Hamada.

258
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Already, that one.

259
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Yes.

260
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Already, that one.

261
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Yes.

262
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Already, I'm almost done.

263
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Already, here.

264
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Yes.

265
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Ah, really.

266
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
It's about time.

267
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Hurry up.

268
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Yes.

269
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Oh, good morning.

270
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Good morning.

271
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
What's up?

272
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I'm here.

273
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
You're here.

274
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Yamazaki?

275
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Yamazaki.

276
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Oh, excuse me.

277
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Excuse me.

278
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
You should have bought more.

279
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Oh, really, you're so rude.

280
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Are you paying properly?

281
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Yes, I am.

282
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
How much do you have?

283
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Do you have enough?

284
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Yes, I do.

285
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I have about 250 yen left.

286
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I have.

287
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Oh, excuse me.

288
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Oh.

289
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I've bought everything.

290
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Really?

291
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
What do you want?

292
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
It's over.

293
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
What?

294
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I'm fine with omurice.

295
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Are you sure?

296
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Yes.

297
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Are you sure?

298
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Yes.

299
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Then both teams are fine.

300
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Then go back to the studio.

301
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Yes.

302
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
The game of rock-paper-scissors.

303
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Yes.

304
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Are you sure?

305
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Are you sure?

306
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
You need to get more fired up.

307
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I'm Tanaka.

308
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Get fired up.

309
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Don't say that now.

310
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
The game of rock-paper-scissors.

311
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Let's go.

312
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Yes.

313
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Hey.

314
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Sorry, sorry.

315
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Hamada-san will get angry.

316
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Sorry, Hamada-san.

317
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
So, the Ryo team is here.

318
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Today, we will be making the omurice.

319
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
We have already said it.

320
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
The omurice is ready.

321
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Are you ready?

322
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Yes, I'm ready.

323
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Are you ready?

324
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Yes, I'm ready.

325
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Hamada-san hasn't said it yet, but we will be making it.

326
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
We'll eat it after it's done.

327
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Please judge.

328
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I'll eat it.

329
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Please.

330
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
What's wrong?

331
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Your face...

332
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Your face is not good.

333
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Your eyes are not good?

334
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
A little.

335
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
You don't seem to be calm.

336
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
You're not confident as usual?

337
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I'm not confident.

338
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
You're not confident as usual?

339
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Yes.

340
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Then, let's start the cooking competition.

341
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
DETSURI COOKING!

342
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Then, Yamada-san.

343
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I'll cut the meat.

344
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:24,000
You are basically a person who eats things.

345
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Yamazaki.

346
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Yes, I'm sorry.

347
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Why are you sorry?

348
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
What's wrong with you?

349
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
No, I'm sorry.

350
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Ouch!

351
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Ouch!

352
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
What's wrong, Endo?

353
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Are you okay, Endo?

354
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Hey, Sugachan.

355
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Sugachan, Endo, can you go to the bathroom?

356
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Sugachan, can you go to the bathroom?

357
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Let's go.

358
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Let's go to the bathroom.

359
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Sugachan, please.

360
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Are you okay?

361
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Are you okay?

362
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Are you okay, Endo?

363
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Sorry.

364
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
What's wrong, Sugai-chan?

365
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Then, give me a little time.

366
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Alright.

367
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
How's the performance?

368
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
It's fine.

369
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I've changed.

370
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I've changed.

371
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
You've changed?

372
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I've changed.

373
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Really?

374
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
You're good at cooking.

375
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Really?

376
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I've changed.

377
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Really?

378
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Your tension has dropped, hasn't it?

379
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Huh?

380
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Your tension has dropped, hasn't it?

381
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
My tension is low.

382
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Tension up more.

383
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
What's wrong, Endo?

384
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Your finger hurts?

385
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
That's a little different.

386
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
That's a little different.

387
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
You need to get more excited.

388
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
More, Endo.

389
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I want to cheer for you.

390
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Yes.

391
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
You understand?

392
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Yes.

393
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
You still have to watch the enemy's moves.

394
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I'm sorry.

395
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Endo, this is too much.

396
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Endo, Endo.

397
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Hey, it's done!

398
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Matsumoto!

399
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
What's wrong?

400
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Matsumoto, are you okay?

401
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Are you okay?

402
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
What's wrong, Matsumoto?

403
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Are you okay?

404
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Matsumoto, are you okay?

405
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

406
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Are you okay?

407
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

408
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Hey, Sugashira!

409
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Yes, yes, yes.

410
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Hey, you're here again.

411
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I'm sorry.

412
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I'm sorry, Sugashira.

413
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Are you okay?

414
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Matsumoto, are you really okay?

415
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I'm okay.

416
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Everything but my heart hurts.

417
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Everything but your heart hurts?

418
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Everything but my heart hurts.

419
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Everyone, come here.

420
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Hey, Mr. Okada, please end this.

421
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Are you okay?

422
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
What?

423
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I'm sorry.

424
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Why did you ask me if I'm okay?

425
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I'm okay.

426
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Please give me some time. I'll do something.

427
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Is Matsumoto okay?

428
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I'm worried.

429
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Matsumoto!

430
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Matsumoto, are you okay?

431
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I'm worried.

432
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Are you okay?

433
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I'm worried.

434
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Matsumoto.

435
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I'll do it properly.

436
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Yes, yes, yes. I'm sorry.

437
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Matsumoto!

438
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
You're suddenly getting a beard.

439
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Matsumoto is big.

440
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I've gotten a little bigger.

441
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I'm sorry.

442
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I'm sorry.

443
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I'm done!

444
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
The end is okay, right?

445
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Okay, okay.

446
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I'll roll it up.

447
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I'll put this on.

448
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Please put it on my face.

449
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I can't move.

450
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Matsumoto, do it more.

451
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Do it more.

452
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Do it more.

453
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I'm sorry.

454
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Matsumoto, what are you doing today?

455
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Now, the dish is ready.

456
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I'm going to eat it.

457
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I'm going to eat it.

458
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
It's delicious.

459
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
It's delicious, Yamazaki!

460
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Hamada, this is really good.

461
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Eat it.

462
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
It's definitely good.

463
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Look, it's really good.

464
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Yes, yes, yes.

465
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Excuse me.

466
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
This is really good.

467
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Really good.

468
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
This is really good.

469
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
This is really good.

470
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
This is really good.

471
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
This is really good.

472
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
This is really good.

473
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
D.R.

474
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
D.R.

475
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
D.R.

476
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I failed.

477
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Good evening.

478
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
This is a sad story, isn't it?

479
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
You didn't do anything on TV, and you're still laughing.

480
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
That's a lousy story, isn't it?

481
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
You can't laugh about that.

482
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
No, no, really, you can't laugh about that.

483
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
That's true.

484
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Well, well, well, how was it?

485
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Recently?

486
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
There are things that you've shown your face to, but...

487
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I don't show my face at all.

488
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
You don't show at all?

489
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Yes, yes.

490
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Oh, really? That's not funny.

491
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
What is?

492
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I'm not, either.

493
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Really, there's nothing.

494
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
It's not funny.

495
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
You'll crash when you get home.

496
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I'll never crash.

497
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Why do you say that?

498
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I can avoid it.

499
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:17,000
You may think it's a joke, but I'm probably the best driver in the world.

500
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Do you know what a possible driving is?

501
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
What?

502
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
A possible driving.

503
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Everyone, please remember this.

504
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
It's a secret.

505
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I don't care.

506
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Let's keep the word, maybe, in our mind.

507
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
What?

508
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Let's put it on a sheet.

509
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Let's put it on a drive.

510
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Let's save it on a radiator.

511
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Save it on a radiator?

512
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Maybe!

513
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Shut up!

514
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I knew it.

515
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:54,000
If you say something like this, you might get hit.

516
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
You know,

517
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
you can't push it at the police station.

518
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:57,500
Yes.

519
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,800
It's possible that they'll come.

520
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,000
Yes, it's possible.

521
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,200
Everyone knows that. Everyone who has a license knows that.

522
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,500
But everyone's possibility is quite high.

523
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:07,500
The society is very generous.

524
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,200
What?

525
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:12,300
Well then, well then, well then.

526
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:13,000
Get on.

527
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,100
I don't want to be ignored.

528
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,600
Get on.

529
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,600
Then what kind of possibility are you thinking about?

530
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,400
Hey.

531
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,300
What?

532
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:23,500
Hey.

533
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:27,000
Is there any way to know if someone will suddenly appear from the side?

534
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Say it properly with the word, maybe.

535
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
There is no such thing as maybe.

536
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
There are many elderly people.

537
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,500
They may appear from the side.

538
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:40,000
Say it more, maybe.

539
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Say it faster!

540
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:48,000
There may be elderly people appearing from the side!

541
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,500
That is the problem.

542
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,500
Why?

543
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:53,500
What is that? It may be the elderly.

544
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,500
Is it okay to end it at that point?

545
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:58,500
It may be the old man.

546
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:01,500
It may be the old lady.

547
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,500
It may be the old lady.

548
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,500
People are people.

549
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:09,500
What is the way you drive the old lady?

550
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,500
It may be the old lady.

551
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:14,500
Of course, it may be all of me.

552
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,500
It may be possible to get a wiper.

553
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,500
What did you do?

554
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:21,500
This is not a security problem.

555
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,500
Let's make it a pattern.

556
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,500
Right? This is a signal.

557
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:28,500
You should think about the signal.

558
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:31,500
It may not be limited to three colors.

559
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,500
You can see it.

560
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:36,500
But there is the fourth color of the heart.

561
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:39,500
This is amazing.

562
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:42,500
What do you mean by the fourth color of the heart?

563
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,500
What?

564
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:53,500
I think that the gorilla came now.

565
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:59,500
I think that the gorilla came now.

566
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:02,500
I always think about the gorilla.

567
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,500
OK.

568
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:07,500
There is another reason for the possibility.

569
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,500
There is a jinx.

570
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:12,500
If you think that there may be something like this, it will not be so.

571
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,500
Do you understand?

572
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:17,500
For that reason, by thinking ahead,

573
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:20,500
It will be made to be nothing.

574
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,500
That's right.

575
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:26,500
Everyone, think about the possibility a little more.

576
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:29,500
Everyone who is riding a car is thinking and driving.

577
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,500
It's okay.

578
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:33,500
What's with that annoying feeling?

579
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:36,500
Everyone wants to go to Kyoshu.

580
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,500
I know that.

581
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:42,500
I don't know if you know, but if you do it like that,

582
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,500
Right?

583
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:47,500
There's still a chance.

584
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,500
Maybe.

585
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,500
Next week, next week.

586
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,500
Ah, that's right.

587
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:59,500
I'm just saying that I'll continue.

588
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:02,500
But, there is next week.

589
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:05,500
So, if you make me look so weak.

590
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:09,500
If this week I am so weak, what will happen next week?

591
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:14,500
A question for Mr. Matsumoto.

592
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:22,500
Please tell us the correct reaction when you received the Macadamia nuts as a souvenir from your friend in Hawaii.

593
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:28,500
This will be the situation where I will receive something from now on.

594
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,500
I'm angry!

595
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,500
Academia Nuts

596
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,500
But you are right.

597
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:38,500
I'm not good at it.

598
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,500
I have a problem.

599
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:46,500
I need a reaction to improve the relationship.

600
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,500
I need it.

601
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,500
I'm a comedian.

602
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,500
I'm a comedian.

603
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,500
Who is a comedian?

604
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,500
I'm not alone.

605
00:18:55,500 --> 00:19:08,500
When you get something, you feel nervous, right?

606
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:12,500
In the end, it's not just the laugh, but also the emotion.

607
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,500
It's the tension and the feeling.

608
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:20,500
When you tear the bag, you feel the tension.

609
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:23,500
Whatever you do here, it probably won't work.

610
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:24,500
I see.

611
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,500
The opponent thinks, let me cry here.

612
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:31,500
But when you open it up, it closes once.

613
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,500
Ehhhhhhhhh!

614
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,500
It's a mess.

615
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,500
But you can use this.

616
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:48,500
The longer this period is, the longer it is.

617
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:53,500
But if you don't know the story, there might be some people who just say it.

618
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:56,500
I'm totally fine with 5 minutes.

619
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:59,500
That mark.

620
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:03,500
After opening and closing, after opening and closing, 5 minutes.

621
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,500
It doesn't have to be longer.

622
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:11,500
After closing, Yu-san will get a gift from the previous owner.

623
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,500
I don't know.

624
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,500
I don't know.

625
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,500
That's right.

626
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:22,500
See, in the past, that kid was always saying something.

627
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:26,500
This is a question for Mr. Matsumoto, who has been through many rough times.

628
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:31,500
I heard that even if you meet a bear in the mountains and pretend to be dead, you will eventually be attacked.

629
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:32,500
Is that so?

630
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:35,500
Ah, yes. That's the wrong answer.

631
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:40,500
If you meet a bear in the mountains, what kind of acting will help you?

632
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:48,500
Ah, I think that you will meet bears 7 or 8 times in the future.

633
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:51,500
I don't know.

634
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,500
It's the easiest.

635
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:55,500
You can do it right away.

636
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,500
It's a lot of trouble.

637
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:58,500
What?

638
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:02,500
I'm saying it's a lot of trouble.

639
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:03,500
No, no.

640
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,500
People who are not good at it say,

641
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,500
Ah, that's the way.

642
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:07,500
It's easy.

643
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,500
Then, please play the bear.

644
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,500
What?

645
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,500
Please play the bear.

646
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,500
Ah, then I'll play the bear.

647
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,500
Where?

648
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,500
On the mountain road, right?

649
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:21,500
It's Hakkoda-san.

650
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:22,500
Yes, it's Hakkoda-san.

651
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,500
Yes, yes.

652
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:24,500
And then?

653
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:30,500
Ah, so it's Hakkoda-san.

654
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:21,540
No, there's a

655
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,500
No, there's a

656
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,500
There is, there is definitely a reason for that.

657
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:38,500
First, things that cannot be drawn.

658
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:41,500
Aaaaaaaaaaaah!

659
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:44,500
You're fast!

660
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:47,500
It's going to end soon!

661
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:51,500
You're really close!

662
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:56,500
You really scared me a little.

663
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:59,500
Please, give me a sign.

664
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:00,500
What?

665
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:01,500
Should I appear like this?

666
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:02,500
Yes, yes.

667
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:07,500
Yes, yes. When I do the four legs, I'm like a kotatsu.

668
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:13,500
Is that okay?

669
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:16,500
Ah, it's so bright here.

670
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,500
The air is so good.

671
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,500
Okay, let's have lunch.

672
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:29,500
Okay.

673
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:32,500
Oh, it's a sandwich.

674
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:35,500
I love sandwiches.

675
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,500
I have to watch it for a long time.

676
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:50,500
Well, then, can you say something like, wow?

677
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:51,500
OK.

678
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:54,500
I love sandwiches!

679
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:08,500
You know, your bear is weird.

680
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,500
It's a final blow.

681
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:13,500
It's definitely trying to kill me.

682
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:17,500
I can't run away even if I'm on a train.

683
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:20,500
Because it's aiming at me.

684
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,500
It's fine if you're just acting.

685
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,500
You're the one who did it!

686
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,500
It's a problem.

687
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,500
So, it's like a party.

688
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:32,500
That means, VS vs.

689
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:35,500
It means that it's no good if it's VS.

690
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,500
So, it's no good if it's like this.

691
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,500
See, it's VS.

692
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:40,500
So, it's no good if it's like this.

693
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:43,500
You can see V and S like this.

694
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:46,500
See, it's ready go!

695
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,500
You can't win if it's like this.

696
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,300
That's why it's no good.

697
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:51,800
So when the bear goes,

698
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,400
BAM!

699
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,400
BAM!

700
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:04,500
The bear becomes a pair.

701
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,400
But I don't know...

702
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,100
No one remembers.

703
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:11,100
BAM!

704
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:15,400
I'll go get some water.

705
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:19,400
