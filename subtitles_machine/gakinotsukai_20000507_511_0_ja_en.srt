1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
From now on, we will begin the 3rd trial of Onuma Akihiro, the Dogechi trial.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Prosecutors and judges, please come forward.

3
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Next, the defendant, Onuma Akihiro, please come forward.

4
00:00:41,000 --> 00:01:01,000
The defendant, Onuma Akihiro, is 37 years old. He is the famous director of Gaki no Tsukai. In the last 2 trials, he was found guilty of the Dogechi crime. But now, he has no reason to regret his actions. He will be judged in the trial.

5
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:14,000
And tonight, the truth about Onuma Akihiro will be revealed.

6
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
This program is brought to you by these sponsors.

7
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Kenji Hamada, please give us the evidence.

8
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:49,000
This is a ski location broadcasted in February this year. It was a project meeting for the next week after this recording.

9
00:01:49,000 --> 00:02:04,000
After the meeting at the hotel, they decided to eat first.

10
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:19,000
When they started to eat, one of them, the author, Suzuki Onuma came to them.

11
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Why are you eating it? It's mine, right?

12
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I ordered it, too. How can you say that?

13
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
What's wrong, Onuma?

14
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:44,000
It's nothing. I just wanted to make sure.

15
00:02:44,000 --> 00:03:00,000
After a few minutes, Onuma went back to his room and started to eat.

16
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:09,000
But the room was heavy.

17
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Sorry to keep you waiting.

18
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Napolitan was brought to his room.

19
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:22,000
At the same time, Onuma got up and started to eat.

20
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Obviously, he was not satisfied with the atmosphere of the place.

21
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Onuma, why are you eating it now?

22
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I realized that Suzuki ate it by mistake.

23
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
It's a big deal, Onuma.

24
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I can't forgive you. You have to do this properly.

25
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,000
After that, the atmosphere of the meeting became even heavier.

26
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:02,000
After a moment of silence, the sound of Onuma eating napolitan was heard in the room.

27
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I'd like to make a confession about the incident.

28
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:17,000
As you all know, it was a black zone.

29
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I was eating it, but I couldn't eat it.

30
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Onuma was angry.

31
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I thought he was arguing about the story.

32
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I thought it was a good thing that the director and the writer quarreled.

33
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I thought Onuma had grown up, so I asked him.

34
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Suzuki ate my napolitan.

35
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:53,000
In the end, the waitress took my napolitan to Suzuki's room.

36
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,000
That was the reason.

37
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I'm sorry to say this, but the napolitan didn't have any color.

38
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Actually, the napolitan was redder than the napolitan.

39
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
The napolitan was redder than the napolitan.

40
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:19,000
The napolitan was redder than the napolitan.

41
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Do you have any objections?

42
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I was in charge of the ski project.

43
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I've been busy since morning.

44
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
You haven't eaten yet.

45
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Everyone's finally going to eat, and I'm going to be able to eat.

46
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I asked the other directors to eat with me.

47
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I asked for three or four people.

48
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
You asked for it.

49
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,000
As far as I could see, Suzuki didn't ask for it.

50
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Let's hear it.

51
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
You didn't ask for it, but Suzuki ate it.

52
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
It's easy to say this.

53
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,000
The writer comes to the set in the afternoon.

54
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I'm in the middle of the day.

55
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
It's not like I haven't eaten at all.

56
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
You're hungry, you're hungry.

57
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
It's completely different.

58
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
But anyone can eat it.

59
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I said it out loud.

60
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I said I asked for it first.

61
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I thought I was mistaken, so I went to check the desk.

62
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Onuma was a little ahead of me.

63
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Onuma was a little ahead of you?

64
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
You went to the desk?

65
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I went there to make it clear.

66
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Normally, if something like that happened, I'd give it to you first.

67
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Suzuki is really...

68
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
He's angry.

69
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
He's angry.

70
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
There may be people who turned on the TV right now.

71
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
What are you talking about?

72
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
This is all about Napolitan.

73
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Onuma didn't think about the meeting at all.

74
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
How was it?

75
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Since Napolitan came, you've only been thinking about Napolitan.

76
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:20,000
That's true.

77
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I knew that Onuma was a little ahead of me, but I was a little surprised this time.

78
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I've been in the TV industry for about 25 years, but this is my first time.

79
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:41,000
It all started after a certain program was recorded.

80
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Onuma, do you want to eat something?

81
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Are you serious?

82
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
At that time, I was living in a hotel in Odaiba.

83
00:07:53,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I invited Onuma, who lived in Odaiba, and decided to go to a fancy Italian restaurant on the way home.

84
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Eventually, the car arrived at the restaurant.

85
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Then, at the entrance of the parking lot, a woman in a red coat was painting.

86
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,000
And the woman approached the two people who got off the car.

87
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I'm always grateful to you. I'm Onuma's wife.

88
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I'm sorry I can't treat you to dinner tonight.

89
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:35,000
As soon as Onuma found out that he was being treated, he stole a little space between the two of them and called his wife.

90
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
He called her to the restaurant.

91
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
You look like you're taking it for granted.

92
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
This foie gras is delicious.

93
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
You should eat it, too. Don't hold back.

94
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:52,000
One after another, the Onuma couple ordered food.

95
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
This is an Italian wine from 1992.

96
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
It's a little sour, but it's okay.

97
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I was surprised that he brought his wife here before I knew it.

98
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
But I couldn't help it.

99
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
He served me a pretty good wine.

100
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
It cost about 40,000 yen at the restaurant.

101
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Then, Onuma started tasting it.

102
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:20,000
When I saw him say something like this, I was getting angry.

103
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
If you say that, it's your money.

104
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
After the meal, the three of them left the restaurant.

105
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Then, Onuma said,

106
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Mr. Iwatashi is staying at Pacific Meridian right now.

107
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
That's amazing. That's a great hotel.

108
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

109
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
That's right, Mr. Iwatashi.

110
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Please show me your room before you go home.

111
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
It's nice, isn't it?

112
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
It's not like you're going to lose money.

113
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
In the end, Onuma pushed them away.

114
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Iwatashi invited them to the hotel room.

115
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Wow, what a nice night view.

116
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Hey, come over here. The bathroom is big, too.

117
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
In a very rich room, Onuma and his wife were having a great time.

118
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,000
And they found something.

119
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:20,000
That's the high-class wine Iwatashi had bought.

120
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I'd like to have a good wine while looking at this view.

121
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Oh, really? Then I'll have a drink.

122
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Just like that, the three of them started drinking wine.

123
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
However, an hour later,

124
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Onuma and his wife found Iwatashi, the owner of the room, and they were in a good mood.

125
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
It's a really nice night.

126
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Yeah, I'm glad you came.

127
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I'd like to say something.

128
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:05,000
If it's for Onuma, I want you to become a millionaire as soon as possible.

129
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I want you to wake up.

130
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
That's a bit of a surprise.

131
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Did you hear what he said?

132
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
The reason why I'm here is because there's a story about the day after tomorrow.

133
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:25,000
After this, the two of them sleep in the double bed of Mr. Iwatashi.

134
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Mr. Iwatashi sleeps on the sofa until morning.

135
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Really?

136
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
When Mr. Iwatashi woke up, the two of them weren't there.

137
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,000
They didn't have bathrobes or slippers.

138
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
That's scary!

139
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Really?

140
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
That's amazing.

141
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
This is an unprecedented event.

142
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
This is very special.

143
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
You don't have any reaction to this, do you?

144
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I was invited by Mr. Iwatashi.

145
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
You wanted to go eat, didn't you?

146
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
No one told you to call your wife?

147
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,000
No, but I like Italian food.

148
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I want to beat you up!

149
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Did your wife come out when you called her?

150
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
She came out right away.

151
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:20,000
She was here a while ago.

152
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
The food was delicious.

153
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I went to the hotel where Mr. Iwatashi stayed.

154
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,000
That's strange.

155
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Why didn't you stay?

156
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I wanted to get drunk.

157
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
What do you mean by that?

158
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
What?

159
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
The bathrobes disappeared after you woke up.

160
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
What do you mean?

161
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I stayed the night, so I thought it was the same condition.

162
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I don't get it.

163
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I thought it was the same condition.

164
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I think he's playing the piano.

165
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I don't think he's laughing.

166
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
He's playing the piano.

167
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
If I were him, I'd watch the music fair.

168
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
In October last year,

169
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Ryuusen, a high-ranking writer,

170
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
held a wedding at a first-class hotel in Tokyo.

171
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
The event was held at the venue.

172
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Onuma was dressed as a taxi driver.

173
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,000
He was in a hurry.

174
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Oh, dear.

175
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I spent all my money on the wedding.

176
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,000
A wedding that costs tens of thousands of yen

177
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,000
is nothing but trouble for Onuma.

178
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Eventually, the ceremony began.

179
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
The ceremony continued,

180
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
and the guests continued to greet each other.

181
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Meanwhile, Onuma's eyes were fixed on the food.

182
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
And the host said,

183
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I'm going to eat now.

184
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Let's eat.

185
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Onuma rushed to the kitchen.

186
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:48,000
And he found a dish that looked like someone else was eating it.

187
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Hey, where's the beef?

188
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
You're the only one who's eating sushi.

189
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Why didn't you tell me, you bastard?

190
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Obviously, Onuma looked strange.

191
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Then Eddie said,

192
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Onuma, this meat sauce is delicious, too.

193
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Meat sauce?

194
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Are you stupid?

195
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
You can't make money with meat sauce.

196
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I'm paying for it.

197
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:24,000
In the end, Onuma didn't care about the bride.

198
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,000
The ceremony was just an eating show.

199
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Onuma's New Year's Eve

200
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:42,000
It was already New Year's Eve.

201
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000
The incident happened after the recording.

202
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Onuma was very satisfied with the recording of the day.

203
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I'm going home.

204
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
At that time, when he looked at the table,

205
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Crab and shrimp were folded.

206
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I found it.

207
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Onuma started to find it.

208
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,000
He went around the tables and started to collect them.

209
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Then Nakai noticed Onuma.

210
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:26,000
That's for the cameramen who haven't eaten yet at work.

211
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Please forgive me.

212
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Onuma was surprised by what he heard.

213
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
But the next moment...

214
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Hey, Yosuke.

215
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Onuma caught the camera chief.

216
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Can I have one of the folded ones?

217
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
But some people haven't eaten yet.

218
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Can I have one of the folded ones?

219
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Can I have one of the folded ones?

220
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Onuma went home with a smile on his face.

221
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
What about the witness?

222
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I was with Nakai at the New Year's party.

223
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I was sad.

224
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I was 30 years old at that time.

225
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I was sad.

226
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I was at the scene.

227
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I've been working as a cameraman for many years.

228
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I know how many cameramen there are.

229
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,000
There were more than that.

230
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Can you look at the back of the camera?

231
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Can you look at the camera?

232
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I'd like to talk to you.

233
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I'd like to ask you a question.

234
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,000
What is this?

235
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
10,000 yen?

236
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
What is it?

237
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
I tried to put it in at first.

238
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,000
But when I saw it, it said it was a divorce.

239
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
What do you mean?

240
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
This guy is amazing.

241
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,000
You don't feel like congratulating the two of them, do you?

242
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
It's not just a Viking.

243
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I don't think there's a reason to hold back.

244
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:40,000
In the past, Matsumoto did a live show.

245
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,000
He said he'd pay me after he saw the money.

246
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I asked him how much I should put in.

247
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
He said it was about 10,000 yen.

248
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I asked him how much he was going to put in.

249
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
He said he'd put in 10,000 yen.

250
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Why do you have to put in that much?

251
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:09,000
10,000 yen

252
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I'm surprised, too.

253
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:17,000
The 100,000 yen crisis curry that was broadcast last week.

254
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,000
There was an incident here, too.

255
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:26,000
That was right after the recording.

256
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Thank you for your hard work.

257
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Yamazaki's breathing was really funny.

258
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:39,000
The cast and staff were very satisfied.

259
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Now we're going to shoot the curry package.

260
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Everyone, please go back to the living room.

261
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
As you can see on the screen,

262
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
To make it easier to see the correct answer,

263
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,000
You need to record the package individually.

264
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
For the sake of the package recording,

265
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
The set is getting ready.

266
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:04,000
The cast and staff are going to the waiting room for the talk recording.

267
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
A man who watches the situation.

268
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I didn't know.

269
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Get out of here. Get out of here.

270
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:21,000
And the moment the cast and staff left the studio.

271
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,000
It's delicious.

272
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Oonuma is eating the rest of the curry in the studio.

273
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:38,000
It's not a problem to say that his will to eat has completely relieved the tension in the studio.

274
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
It's just about time.

275
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
We didn't know what happened after that.

276
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Please confirm.

277
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Please explain what happened after that.

278
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
There was a rumor about this before.

279
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Especially during the Kiki series.

280
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:00,000
There was a rumor that something was going on.

281
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
At that time, I was in charge of the broadcast station.

282
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I got a call from the AD.

283
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I was able to jump in.

284
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I took a picture.

285
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,000
What do you mean you were able to jump in?

286
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
I got a call from the AD.

287
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
I was able to jump in.

288
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I was able to jump in.

289
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
I was able to jump in.

290
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
I was able to jump in.

291
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I'm scared, but everyone is scared.

292
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,000
I'm scared, but everyone is scared.

293
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
The script was finally captured.

294
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Oonuma's true form.

295
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Oonuma's true form.

296
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
You are eating as much as you want.

297
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:21,000
This guy is terrible.

298
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:32,000
You are eating as much as you want.

299
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:39,000
People often eat delicious food at restaurants.

300
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:44,000
I didn't eat much during the recording.

301
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:50,000
What would you do if you jumped in during the recording?

302
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
I ate a lot of rice.

303
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
I ate a lot of rice.

304
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Did you eat rice before that?

305
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
I ate rice before that.

306
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,000
I bought a lot of rice.

307
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:10,000
I bought a lot of rice.

308
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:15,000
I bought a lot of rice.

309
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:20,000
The verdict was finally given.

310
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:25,000
The verdict was finally given.

311
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,000
The verdict was finally given.

312
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:34,000
The verdict was finally given.

313
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:39,000
The verdict was finally given.

314
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:48,000
The verdict was finally given.

315
00:23:48,000 --> 00:24:05,000
The verdict was finally given.

316
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:13,000
The verdict was finally given.

317
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:18,000
This program was brought to you by these sponsors.
