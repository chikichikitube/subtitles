1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Tokyo Pier is fun.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,300
What happened to the cherry blossoms?

3
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:04,900
They fell.

4
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:05,700
Did they?

5
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:08,000
It rained a lot.

6
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:08,700
Yeah.

7
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:13,500
Why do cherry blossoms fall when it rains?

8
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,500
You hate them, don't you?

9
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,600
Are you criticizing cherry blossoms?

10
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,400
No, I'm not.

11
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:22,800
I want them to bloom more.

12
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,400
I want them to be warmer.

13
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,800
They'll fall.

14
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,600
Thank you.

15
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:30,800
I have a favor to ask.

16
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:31,400
Yes.

17
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:36,200
My wife wants to see the opening.

18
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:36,800
Oh, really?

19
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,400
I'm sorry.

20
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,200
I just want to say hello.

21
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,700
Oh, I see.

22
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:44,000
Kanae.

23
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Kanae?

24
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,200
Kanae.

25
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,000
She's the wife of Mr. Tsubasa.

26
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Hello.

27
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,400
Thank you for always taking care of me.

28
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,800
I used to be an idol singer.

29
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:59,800
I had a break, but I forced her to get married and retire.

30
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:02,500
Yes.

31
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:06,400
Today, I'll give you some sashimi.

32
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,200
I'll give you some sashimi.

33
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,200
Can I have some chocolate?

34
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,200
Here you go.

35
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,500
Wow, that's gross.

36
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:18,200
I worked hard to make it.

37
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,800
Is your wife still alive?

38
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,800
No, she's dead.

39
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:22,400
It stinks.

40
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,300
No, no.

41
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:26,200
Can I have some?

42
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,600
It's my favorite dish.

43
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,000
That's gross.

44
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I put green onions on it.

45
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,200
It's good.

46
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,400
Try it.

47
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,500
I can't eat it.

48
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:40,400
I'll give it to you later.

49
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,800
I'll give it to you later.

50
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,800
I'll give it to you later.

51
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:51,000
What's wrong?

52
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,600
Kanae.

53
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,000
What's wrong?

54
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,600
Are you mad?

55
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,400
I'll give it to you later.

56
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,600
I'll give it to you later.

57
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,800
It's delicious.

58
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:03,600
Let's go over there.

59
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,200
Please eat this.

60
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,600
Let's go, Kanae.

61
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,400
Thank you.

62
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,600
Kanae, come here.

63
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,000
What are you doing?

64
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:23,600
I'm wrestling.

65
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:28,400
This program is brought to you by these sponsors.

66
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:41,000
It's time for the world's most beautiful and exciting heatless kiss battle.

67
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,600
Let's play three games.

68
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,600
Let's play three games.

69
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:49,200
We'll win each other's games.

70
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,600
The world's most beautiful and exciting heatless kiss battle.

71
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,200
Thank you.

72
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,400
That's a good idea.

73
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:58,400
We don't need money.

74
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,800
We've already made a lot of money.

75
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:09,600
We don't need money.

76
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,400
It doesn't matter to the viewers.

77
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:21,200
By the way, today is the first time that our producer and his wife have come to our program.

78
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,000
It's going to be a hot game.

79
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,200
Let's start the game.

80
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:35,000
The first game is the world's most beautiful and exciting heatless kiss battle.

81
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,800
It's easy.

82
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,600
I brought a box.

83
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,600
There are five phones in the box.

84
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:45,000
You can choose one by one.

85
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,600
Which phone will be the first to arrive?

86
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:54,000
It's time to kiss.

87
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,200
It's like an ademon.

88
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,600
It's time to kiss.

89
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:02,000
The first one is from the UK.

90
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:14,800
Nice to meet you.

91
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,600
Wait, wait, wait.

92
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,800
What is it?

93
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:25,000
Hey, wife.

94
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,400
You don't have a nose.

95
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:33,000
Hey, wife.

96
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,600
What is it?

97
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,600
What is this?

98
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,400
I'm a Japanese beauty, too.

99
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,000
No, I'm sorry.

100
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,200
Am I not good enough?

101
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,000
Who brought you here?

102
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,400
I don't know who.

103
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:53,800
You have to bring someone better than me.

104
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:57,400
Kanae, Kanae, what's wrong?

105
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,800
What?

106
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,000
Please.

107
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
We're in the middle of the show.

108
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,200
Hey.

109
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,600
Wait, wait, wait.

110
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,200
That's not good.

111
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,400
Let me recommend you.

112
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,600
What's wrong?

113
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:18,600
Do you want to play that role?

114
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:22,800
Can I go to Kanae?

115
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,600
The project has changed.

116
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:30,200
I'm a Japanese beauty, so I don't care.

117
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:33,400
I don't care if you come out.

118
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:39,400
You can be the world's most beautiful woman.

119
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:43,400
I'm a Japanese beauty, so I don't care.

120
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,200
Just this time.

121
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,400
I'm sorry.

122
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,400
I'm sorry.

123
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,000
AD, can I sit here?

124
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,400
I'm counting on you.

125
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,000
Well, then...

126
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,600
Are you going to pull out your phone?

127
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,000
Well, then...

128
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,400
The person who gets the call can be a beautiful woman.

129
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:11,000
I'm counting on you.

130
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,800
Go ahead.

131
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,400
The order is the same.

132
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,000
I'm counting on you.

133
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,600
I'm really counting on you.

134
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,800
I'm counting on you.

135
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,400
I'm really counting on you.

136
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:31,200
I'm really counting on you.

137
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,600
I'm really counting on you.

138
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,200
Don't call me.

139
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:37,200
Don't call me.

140
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,400
I'm really counting on you.

141
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:43,200
I'm going to call a beautiful woman.

142
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,000
I'm going to call a beautiful woman.

143
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,400
Are you all okay?

144
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,600
Yes.

145
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:50,200
I'm standing up.

146
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,000
Raise your head a little bit.

147
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,400
It's the same, isn't it?

148
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,400
The winner is...

149
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:02,600
Matsumoto Hikoshi!

150
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,600
Congratulations!

151
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,800
I was scared for a second.

152
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,000
That's too bad.

153
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,600
I'm glad I won.

154
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,800
I'll take this.

155
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,000
Thank you.

156
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Well, then...

157
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,500
It's a kiss with a beautiful woman.

158
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,600
Go ahead.

159
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:28,800
When I said I needed you.

160
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:34,800
You said you would always stay.

161
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:40,200
It wasn't me who changed it for you.

162
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:47,200
And now you've gone away.

163
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:52,200
It's a kiss with a beautiful woman.

164
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,400
It's over!

165
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:59,000
Wait a minute.

166
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,600
I feel like my soul has been taken away.

167
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,200
Congratulations.

168
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:07,000
Wait a minute.

169
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,800
What is this?

170
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,200
I'm counting on you.

171
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,200
I'm really counting on you.

172
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,000
I'm really counting on you.

173
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,800
Where are you going next?

174
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,200
Get out of here.

175
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:20,600
Let's get this over with.

176
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:28,800
Next up is the love machine!

177
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,000
It's easy.

178
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,800
There are five machines.

179
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,400
Choose one you like.

180
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:40,600
There's one that doesn't have electricity flowing through it.

181
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,200
It's a kiss with a beautiful woman.

182
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:49,800
There's one that doesn't have electricity flowing through it.

183
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,200
The one that will kiss the winner is...

184
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,400
The Russian!

185
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,800
I'm really into Russia.

186
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,000
Please come out.

187
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,600
Russia.

188
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,800
Go home.

189
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,600
Why are you here?

190
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,200
Go home.

191
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,600
Excuse me.

192
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,300
Okita.

193
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,300
Kanae.

194
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,400
What?

195
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,200
What are you doing?

196
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,200
What?

197
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,600
What are you doing?

198
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,800
Why?

199
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,200
Why are you doing this when I'm here?

200
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,200
Why?

201
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,800
No, no, no.

202
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,800
I don't like this.

203
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:29,200
I don't like it unless it's more beautiful than me.

204
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,200
It's beautiful, isn't it?

205
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,400
It's beautiful, isn't it?

206
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,600
Yes, yes, yes.

207
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,200
Kanae.

208
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,200
What's wrong?

209
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:35,600
Kanae.

210
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,200
I'm sorry.

211
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,000
He's the president, so he doesn't need it.

212
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,800
I promised him only once.

213
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:46,200
Do you want to do it again?

214
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,200
He's an idol singer.

215
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,400
Don't be a pro-wrestler.

216
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,200
No, no, no.

217
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,400
He's an idol singer.

218
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:59,000
He has a little pride as an idol.

219
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,400
Kanae.

220
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,400
What is it?

221
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,600
There's nothing.

222
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,000
There's nothing.

223
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Kanae.

224
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,800
You're a senior in the entertainment world.

225
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,800
No, no, no.

226
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,800
It's only three times.

227
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:17,800
If you put this in, it'll be a disaster for both of you.

228
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,800
It's over.

229
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,800
Just this time.

230
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,800
Yes.

231
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,800
Really.

232
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,800
Let's make it the last time.

233
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,800
Yes.

234
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:26,800
What?

235
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,800
Kanae.

236
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:31,800
I have something like that.

237
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,800
No, no, no.

238
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,800
Just one more time.

239
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,800
Just one more time.

240
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,800
Let's make it the last time.

241
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,800
Let's choose one.

242
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,800
Yes.

243
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,800
I'll go here.

244
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,800
I'll go here.

245
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,800
Do you want to go?

246
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,800
Can I go here?

247
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,800
I'll go in the middle.

248
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,800
I don't know.

249
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,800
If you wear this, you're safe.

250
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,800
If you don't wear it, the electricity won't flow.

251
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,800
If you wear it, you're safe.

252
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,800
If you wear it, you're out.

253
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,800
You can't kiss.

254
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,800
If you wear it, you can't kiss.

255
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:06,800
If you wear it, you can't kiss.

256
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,800
I'm scared.

257
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,800
I'm scared.

258
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,800
I'm scared, but I want you to wear it.

259
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:16,800
Let's switch on the vision.

260
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,800
Please.

261
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,800
It hurts.

262
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:24,800
It hurts.

263
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,800
You're kidding.

264
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:34,800
Everyone is wearing it.

265
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,800
I'm not wearing it.

266
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:37,800
Everyone is wearing it.

267
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:38,800
It's not true.

268
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:39,800
I'm not wearing it.

269
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:40,800
Take your shoes off.

270
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,800
I'm not wearing it.

271
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:42,800
It's a lie.

272
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,800
Everyone is wearing it.

273
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:44,800
It's a lie.

274
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,800
Don't lie to me.

275
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:46,800
No, I'm not wearing it.

276
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,800
Who is it?

277
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,800
Who?

278
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:50,800
I'm not wearing it.

279
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:51,800
Who's lying?

280
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:52,800
I'm not wearing it.

281
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,800
I'm not wearing it.

282
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:54,800
I'm not wearing it.

283
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,800
It's a lie.

284
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,800
Who is this?

285
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,800
Look, look.

286
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,800
You're right.

287
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,800
Who is it?

288
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:00,800
I'm not wearing it...

289
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,800
I'm not wearing it.

290
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,800
There are a ton of suspects.

291
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,800
You lie to me.

292
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,800
You're Yamasaki, right?

293
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:06,800
No, no, no!

294
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,800
It's you!

295
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:08,800
It's you!

296
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,800
You're the one who came!

297
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:11,800
You're lying!

298
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,800
You're lying!

299
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,800
You're lying!

300
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,800
You're not wearing anything, so you're the real one!

301
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:18,800
It's true!

302
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,800
You're not wearing anything at all!

303
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,800
What?

304
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,800
You're lying!

305
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,800
The winner is...

306
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,800
Yamasaki Yosaku!

307
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,800
Congratulations!

308
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,800
Congratulations!

309
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,800
Congratulations!

310
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,800
I'm happy.

311
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,800
Because I can kiss a beautiful woman.

312
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,800
It's not a big deal.

313
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,800
I'm grateful.

314
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:48,800
It's a kiss with a beautiful woman!

315
00:12:48,800 --> 00:13:03,800
Please!

316
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,800
Your face is full.

317
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:30,800
It's a kiss with a beautiful woman!

318
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:45,800
It's a kiss with a beautiful woman!

319
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:51,800
It's as long as a Japanese movie.

320
00:13:51,800 --> 00:14:00,800
The last one is a lucky card for a beautiful woman and a pittanko!

321
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:05,800
There are cards from 1 to 6.

322
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,800
Please choose one.

323
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:13,800
A beautiful woman will appear and do this.

324
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:17,800
If you have the same number of cards, it's a pittanko!

325
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,800
It's a kiss with a beautiful woman!

326
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,800
Where is the next beautiful woman?

327
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,800
The last beautiful woman is...

328
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:24,800
She's from Russia!

329
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,800
It's a beautiful woman from America!

330
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,800
I was surprised!

331
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:36,800
That's...

332
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:37,800
What?

333
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,800
There's no nose.

334
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:40,800
That's strange.

335
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:41,800
It's a beautiful woman from America.

336
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:42,800
Mr. Suga.

337
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:43,800
Yes?

338
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,800
What do you mean?

339
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,800
Please take it off.

340
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:46,800
I won't.

341
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:47,800
Really.

342
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,800
Take it off.

343
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,800
It's beautiful.

344
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:53,800
What do you mean?

345
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,800
It's cute.

346
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:56,800
It's not cute.

347
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,800
It's from America, right?

348
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:58,800
It's from America.

349
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:06,800
It's like a playmate.

350
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,800
You don't have to run away.

351
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:11,800
It's from America, right?

352
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:12,800
It's from America.

353
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:13,800
Playmate.

354
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:14,800
Cowgirl.

355
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,800
Is this America?

356
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,800
It's the last match.

357
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,800
I'll do it according to the rules.

358
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:23,800
Please.

359
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:26,800
The rules haven't changed much, have they?

360
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,800
It's a kiss with a beautiful woman, right?

361
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,800
Isn't there anyone from America?

362
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,800
Isn't there anyone?

363
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,800
Did you return it?

364
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:34,800
I returned it.

365
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:35,800
What do you mean?

366
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,800
I'm here.

367
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:38,800
Cowgirl.

368
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:39,800
Hey.

369
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,800
Why are you asking?

370
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,800
I returned it.

371
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:44,800
I'm an idol.

372
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,800
It's too much.

373
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:50,800
This is not a place to resist.

374
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,800
Why?

375
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,800
This is the producer's request.

376
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,800
Why?

377
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:04,800
Let's do it according to the rules.

378
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,800
We've been crying, haven't we?

379
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,800
It's okay to look at the screen.

380
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,800
It's a rude conversation.

381
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,800
Hey.

382
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,800
Are you the leader?

383
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,800
I'm not the leader.

384
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,800
Isn't it amazing?

385
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,800
Didn't you say something amazing?

386
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:27,800
I didn't say anything.

387
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,800
It's according to me.

388
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:30,800
What's wrong?

389
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:31,800
This.

390
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,800
This is the president.

391
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:36,800
Isn't the president the leader?

392
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,800
The president is a senior in the entertainment industry.

393
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:44,800
You know what you want to do if you're a senior.

394
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,800
That's why I want to do it.

395
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,800
That's why I returned it.

396
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,800
I can't believe it.

397
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,800
Am I beautiful?

398
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,800
You're wrong.

399
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,800
No, it's you.

400
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:01,800
That's right.

401
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,800
What do you want to do?

402
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,800
I want to have a beautiful body.

403
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:11,800
You have a beautiful body.

404
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:15,800
You have a beautiful body.

405
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,800
We love each other all the time.

406
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:21,800
I want to kiss you.

407
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:25,800
You used to have a beautiful body.

408
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,800
I took it from you.

409
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:33,800
You don't have to say that name.

410
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:34,800
I'll turn off the light.

411
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,800
There are six of us.

412
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:37,800
What are we going to do?

413
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,800
Is it possible that all of us are safe?

414
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,800
You can do it again.

415
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:42,800
Do it again?

416
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:43,800
If it's safe, isn't it okay?

417
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,800
No, it's okay.

418
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,800
If you do that, you won't be in the picture.

419
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,800
I'm in the picture.

420
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,800
You're going to put out the DVD, right?

421
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,800
I'm not going to put out the DVD.

422
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:55,800
I won't put it out.

423
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:56,800
I won't buy it.

424
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:59,800
There's nothing we can do about it.

425
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,800
There's no way to do it.

426
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,800
Come on.

427
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:04,800
Why don't you take two?

428
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,800
Why?

429
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,800
Why?

430
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:09,800
There's no way to do it with one.

431
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,800
All right, then.

432
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,800
I'll do it for fun.

433
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,800
Can I see it?

434
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,800
You can see it for yourself.

435
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,800
It doesn't look like it's going to work.

436
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,800
I'll just show you this.

437
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:26,800
Just take it off.

438
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,800
I wanted to do this.

439
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,800
Hey, play.

440
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:32,800
That's not good.

441
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,800
That's not a good way to say it.

442
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,800
That's not good.

443
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:39,800
I'm counting on you.

444
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,800
Hey, are you really going to draw it?

445
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:44,800
Oh, here it comes.

446
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,800
I did it.

447
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:47,800
I did it.

448
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,800
Safe.

449
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:52,800
One more time.

450
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:53,800
It's cut off.

451
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,800
What are you going to do if you get three this time?

452
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:57,800
That's safe, right?

453
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:58,800
Let's end it here.

454
00:18:58,800 --> 00:18:59,800
Give me a chance.

455
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:02,800
They say there are three passes, but let's do it three times.

456
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,800
What if you can't do it in three times?

457
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:07,800
Why did you become the host?

458
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:10,800
I just did what I wanted to do.

459
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,800
I'm counting on you.

460
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:19,800
One more time.

461
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,800
It's three times.

462
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,800
One more time.

463
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,800
Wait a minute.

464
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,800
Three times.

465
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,800
Two times.

466
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:28,800
Two times.

467
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,800
Who is it?

468
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:33,800
It's you.

469
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:37,800
No, no, no.

470
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:40,800
What should I do?

471
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:41,800
I don't like you.

472
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:42,800
What?

473
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:43,800
I don't like you.

474
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:44,800
What about me?

475
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,800
I don't like you.

476
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:46,800
Go home.

477
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,800
You guys can go home, too.

478
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:49,800
Can I go home?

479
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:50,800
Wait a minute.

480
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,800
Can I go home?

481
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:57,800
I don't like you.

482
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,800
I don't like you.

483
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:00,800
I don't like you.

484
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:01,800
You guys can go home.

485
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,800
You...

486
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:05,800
You guys can go home.

487
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:08,800
You are the wife of a producer.

488
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,800
I can't help it.

489
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:11,800
I can't help it.

490
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,800
You are the wife of a producer.

491
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,800
Wait a minute.

492
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:15,800
This has nothing to do with the game.

493
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:18,800
Let's have a little kiss.

494
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,800
It's not related to the game.

495
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:21,800
Let go of me.

496
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,800
I can't believe it!

497
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:26,800
I can't believe it!

498
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:27,800
I can't believe it!

499
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,800
I can't believe it!

500
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:49,800
I can't believe it!

501
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,800
I can't believe it!

502
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,800
What are you looking at?

503
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,800
I can't believe it!

504
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,800
I can't feel my strength anymore!

505
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,800
I can't feel my strength anymore!

506
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,800
I can't feel my strength anymore!

507
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,800
Hamada-san!

508
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,800
Hamada-san, come back!

509
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,800
Hamada-san!

510
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,800
Hamada-san!

511
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,800
Masumasa!

512
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,800
I can't believe it!

513
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:23,800
I can't feel my strength anymore!

514
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,800
You're dead.

515
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,800
Where am I?

516
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:33,800
You're all being sucked in.

517
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,800
You're all being sucked in.

518
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,800
Cut!

519
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:47,800
Please give me a name that will become popular in 20 years.

520
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:51,800
I think that in 20 years, names will be gone.

521
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,800
That's a great thing to say.

522
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,800
What are you going to do if you don't have a name?

523
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,800
What?

524
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,800
You won't be able to ask for it.

525
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,800
Like Matsumoto-kun.

526
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,800
Ah, yes, yes.

527
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:03,800
You won't be able to call me Hitoshi-kun.

528
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:04,800
Yes, yes, yes.

529
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:09,800
Recently, everyone has become really greedy.

530
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,800
For example, even with a cell phone,

531
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,800
one person is no longer a thing.

532
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,800
It's natural to have two.

533
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,800
Also, a sidecar.

534
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,800
A sidecar?

535
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,800
A second car?

536
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:27,800
There aren't many people who ride a sidecar.

537
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,800
No, no, no.

538
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,800
I knew right away when you said it.

539
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,800
I knew it was wrong.

540
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:40,800
But I knew it was the same speed as everyone else.

541
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,800
So it's totally fine.

542
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:45,800
Everyone has become really greedy.

543
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:46,800
Yes, yes, yes.

544
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,800
They've become greedy, and in the future,

545
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:52,800
the Japanese population will continue to grow like it did before.

546
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,800
That means there won't be any more.

547
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,800
But in order to circulate the economy,

548
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:59,800
having two people is absolutely necessary.

549
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:00,800
I see.

550
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:01,800
Yes.

551
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:02,800
Especially as it gets older.

552
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:03,800
It's fine.

553
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:04,800
It's fine to have a name.

554
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,800
So, Hiroshi or Takashi.

555
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:07,800
Takashi.

556
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,800
Mitsuko or Kyoko.

557
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:17,800
Hello, I'm Tanaka Mitsuko or Kyoko.

558
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,800
At first, you said your name was going to disappear.

559
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,800
That's why, at some point,

560
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,800
at some point, the actress suddenly changed her name.

561
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,800
She suddenly changed her name.

562
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,800
You said your name was going to disappear,

563
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,800
so you kept thinking about it.

564
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,800
That's not half of the story.

565
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:37,800
Why is that?

566
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:38,800
That's strange.

567
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:39,800
What kind of cafe is that?

568
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:40,800
What do you mean by that?

569
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:42,800
What do you mean by that?

570
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:43,800
It's all a cafe.

571
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,800
Well, it will definitely be like that.

572
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,800
Also, Taro of Jiro.

573
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,800
That's a bit too much.

574
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:54,800
What do you mean by of Jiro?

575
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:58,800
Are you stupid?

576
00:23:58,800 --> 00:23:59,800
Yes.

577
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:02,800
If Sato.

578
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,800
What do you mean by of?

579
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:08,800
What do you mean by that?

580
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:33,800
What do you mean by that?
