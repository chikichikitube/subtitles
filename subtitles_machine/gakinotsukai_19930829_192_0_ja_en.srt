1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
I wonder if everyone is having fun today?

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
If you do it, you'll live forever!

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Chikiseki Matcha Hama-chan vs. Karaoke Udasu-san!

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
The pink team is the matcha team.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
These are the members.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
The blue team is the Hama-chan team.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
The pink team is the Hama-chan team.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
This team is not red-faced.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Where is this guy from?

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
No, no, no, why?

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The reason why this team is red-faced is because this team is a former team.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
The pink team is the Hama-chan team.

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
As I said at the beginning, the captain will be the player.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
We will have a match.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
In the end, both teams will get a total score.

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
It's simple. The team with the highest total score wins.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
If you lose, the losing team will be punished.

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'll do this.

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Let's say it together.

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Coach!

21
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Don't talk!

22
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
The pink team is the Hama-chan team.

23
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:50,000
The pink team is the Hama-chan team.

24
00:01:50,000 --> 00:02:05,000
The pink team is the Hama-chan team.

25
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:16,000
The pink team is the Hama-chan team.

26
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,000
The pink team is the Hama-chan team.

27
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
The pink team is the Hama-chan team.

28
00:02:36,000 --> 00:03:04,000
The pink team is the Hama-chan team.

29
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
The pink team is the Hama-chan team.

30
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
The pink team is the Hama-chan team.

31
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I'm glad.

32
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
It's okay.

33
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I'm glad I got over 80 points.

34
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
You're not good at this.

35
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I'm glad I got over 80 points.

36
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I'm glad I got over 80 points.

37
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I'm glad I got over 80 points.

38
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:44,000
You're not going to change at all, though it's sad

39
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Don't close your eyes

40
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Don't worry, just go in, just go in, don't come out

41
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
That's not good

42
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
There's a song like that, there's a song like that

43
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:28,000
It's so good

44
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
It's so good

45
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
You can't say such a thing

46
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
You can't say such a thing

47
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
You can't sing

48
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
No, no, you can't

49
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
What's wrong with you?

50
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
You can't sing this song

51
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
You can't sing this song

52
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Don't think about it

53
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
You can't even think about it

54
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
You can do it

55
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I don't like this kind of pessimistic thinking.

56
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
You're too excited.

57
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Who are you?

58
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Who are you?

59
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
You're too excited.

60
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I said, who are you?

61
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:39,000
You know, I've been pretending a little bit, but I'm going to go all out from this time.

62
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Oh, really?

63
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Yes.

64
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Right?

65
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Yes.

66
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I'm not going to lose.

67
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
If we win 5 points each, we're going to win.

68
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Oh, I see.

69
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Are you ready?

70
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Yes, go ahead.

71
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
At the end, there's my charm of low temperature.

72
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Where's the low temperature?

73
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Hey, turn around.

74
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
At the end, there's my charm of low temperature.

75
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Why do you say it twice?

76
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I want you to hear it again.

77
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I wanted to say, why do you say it twice?

78
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I'm going to go.

79
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
It's okay.

80
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I'm going to go.

81
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I'm going to go.

82
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I'm going to go.

83
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I'm going to go.

84
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Don't be angry.

85
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
You shouldn't have thrown it.

86
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,080
Stop it!

87
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:40,280
You can win this!

88
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,280
It's cold

89
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,280
Ah, it's wrong

90
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,280
It's going up

91
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:51,280
The festival is somewhere in this world

92
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,280
It's not funny

93
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,280
Shabang

94
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,280
Ah

95
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:59,280
Take a shower

96
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,280
Hawaii

97
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,280
It's two

98
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,280
It's two

99
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:11,280
Thank you

100
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:22,280
You like this song

101
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:24,280
This is all

102
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,280
It's dirty

103
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,280
Shabang

104
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,280
Shabang

105
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:31,280
Even if I look back

106
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:36,280
Even if I look back

107
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,280
I'm a Hamada

108
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,280
I'm a Hamada

109
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:43,280
I'm a Hamada from downtown

110
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:48,280
It's short

111
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:51,280
I sang until the second part

112
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:58,280
Thank you

113
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:03,280
Today, I was praised by a bad actor

114
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,280
I'm a fool

115
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,280
I'm sorry

116
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,280
I've been doing this since elementary school

117
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,280
Ah

118
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,280
I'm doing it

119
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,280
Sing

120
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,280
Eiko E

121
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:19,280
It's Eiko

122
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,280
I'm a fool

123
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,280
I've been doing this since elementary school

124
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,280
Why?

125
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,280
This is impossible

126
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,280
This is a score

127
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,280
Peru

128
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,280
Peru

129
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,280
It's still

130
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,280
It's still

131
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,280
It's going up

132
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:50,280
I'm nervous

133
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,280
I'm nervous

134
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,280
Peru

135
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,280
Peru

136
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:58,280
Peru, your skin is getting thicker

137
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,280
Peru

138
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,280
Peru, did you get sick somewhere?

139
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,280
Peru

140
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,280
Grandpa

141
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,280
Grandpa who was doing takoyaki

142
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,280
Wait a minute

143
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:16,280
Even my dad

144
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,280
Even my dad

145
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:24,280
Actually

146
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:39,280
Eiko E

147
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:44,280
Let's take a look at the total score

148
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:50,280

149
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,280

Eiko E

152
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,280
Eiko E

153
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:01,280
The person who automatically says it is Machan

154
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:04,280
Eiko E

155
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,280

Eiko E

172
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:39,280
You are taking too much time, the audience is getting angry

173
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:42,280
I'm sorry, I'm really sorry

174
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,280
Go home

175
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:51,280
This year was hard too, 24 hours

176
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:54,280
I didn't do it! I didn't do it!

177
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,280
I went to Budokan

178
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,280
You're lying!

179
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,280
I went like this

180
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:04,280
If you're going to look at me like that, then go out!

181
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,280
Am I that kind of man?

182
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:09,280
This year, you said you didn't want to do it so I refused

183
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,280
Wait!

184
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:17,280
I didn't do it

185
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,280
But I really wanted to do it

186
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,280
You wanted to do it

187
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:20,780
What?

188
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:21,280
You wanted to do it

189
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,280
I didn't want to do it

190
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,280
You wanted to do it, didn't you?

191
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,280
What do you mean?

192
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,280
Whether it's high or low

193
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,280
What are you talking about?

194
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,280
Oh, low?

195
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,280
That's not it

196
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,280
What?

197
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,280
I didn't say I didn't want to do it

198
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,280
That's right, you wanted to do it, didn't you?

199
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:42,280
That's why I wanted to do it as Matsumoto Hitoshi

200
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,280
What are you talking about?

201
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:49,280
Then let me do it next year

202
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,280
How many times?

203
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,280
You have 24 hours, let me do it next year

204
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,280
That means I'm alone?

205
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,280
No, Matsumoto Hitoshi wants to do it, right?

206
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,280
Matsumoto Hitoshi is an individual

207
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:04,280
Matsumoto Hitoshi doesn't want to do it, he doesn't want to sing Sakura Fubuki

208
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,280
That has nothing to do with it

209
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:08,280
He sang Sakura Fubuki alone at home

210
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,280
What are you talking about?

211
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,280
He sang it last year

212
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,280
Don't lie

213
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:14,280
Why don't you take off your clothes and go home?

214
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:17,280
It looks like Kanpei-san is satisfied

215
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,280
That's good

216
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,280
It's amazing

217
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,280
That's why I think

218
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,280
You run, right?

219
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:25,280
You push yourself into a difficult place

220
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:28,280
People are getting closer to God

221
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,280
I see

222
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:32,280
You're getting closer to God

223
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,280
Yes, yes

224
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,280
Safe, safe

225
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:39,280
You're becoming very kind

226
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,280
Yes, yes

227
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,280
You're becoming humble

228
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,280
What are you talking about?

229
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,280
What are you talking about?

230
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,280
What's with that hand?

231
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,280
How do you do that?

232
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:58,280
How do you do that?

233
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:04,280
I think that's true

234
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,280
But this year

235
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:08,280
The world championship is in the way

236
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,280
That's dirty

237
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:13,280
It looks like the world champion is running on a bike

238
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,280
That's not true

239
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,280
Well, well

240
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,280
That's dirty

241
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,280
He's pooping on his pants

242
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,280
That's dirty

243
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,280
That's really dirty

244
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,280
It's not what I'm saying

245
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:28,280
He's mentally pooping on his pants

246
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:31,280
Don't say things you don't understand

247
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:35,280
Everyone has pants in their heart

248
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:40,280
Everyone has pants in their heart

249
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:43,280
I don't have a dream

250
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:46,280
If you think about your pants, you have a dream

251
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:51,280
If you think about your pants, you have a dream

252
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:54,280
Life is about your pants

253
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,280
What about my pants?

254
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:58,280
What about my pants?

255
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,280
What are you talking about?

256
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,280
Don't point your finger

257
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,280
It's sunny

258
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,280
What about your pants?

259
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,280
Stop it

260
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,280
The other day

261
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:12,280
I was reading a book

262
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:16,280
It's been a long time since I saw someone pooping

263
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:19,280
I was reading a book

264
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:22,280
That man came to me

265
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,280
He was standing behind me

266
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,280
We're lovers

267
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,280
We're lovers

268
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,280
Were you here?

269
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:32,280
I thought you were gone

270
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,280
I was here the whole time

271
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,280
Don't say things you don't understand

272
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,280
Let's go over there

273
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:40,280
What kind of person is he?

274
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,280
Stop it

275
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:47,280
Give me back what I just said

276
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,280
I was so surprised

277
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:54,280
Don't say things you don't understand

278
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:56,280
A couple who are both ugly

279
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,280
Have a very good conversation

280
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:02,280
An ugly woman and an ugly man

281
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:06,280
They are licking each other's wounds

282
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,280
They are saying something amazing

283
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,280
I was surprised

284
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:12,280
You're the only one I can see

285
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,280
Wait

286
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,280
I was told

287
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:20,280
Is that so?

288
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:22,280
I'm scared

289
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:25,280
Where did you see that?

290
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:28,280
Don't say things like that

291
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:31,280
I'm saying things like that

292
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:34,280
I'm saying it on the bench at the park

293
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:36,280
You're saying it on the bench?

294
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,280
I'm scared

295
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:40,280
You were saying something amazing

296
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:42,280
An ugly woman

297
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:45,280
At the same cost

298
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:47,280
It's shocking

299
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:50,280
Who? You?

300
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:53,280
You're talking about what you saw

301
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:56,280
A long time ago

302
00:15:56,280 --> 00:16:00,280
There was an ugly woman who was unthinkable

303
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:03,280
When I turned around

304
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:06,280
She was there

305
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:09,280
She was waiting for me

306
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,280
She was screaming

307
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,280
You're not a poop

308
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:22,280
If it's that bad

309
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,280
It's not like this

310
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:28,280
It's a very refreshing feeling

311
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:31,280
Ah!

312
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:37,280
How do you want to change your name?

313
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:40,280
How do you want to change your name?

314
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:43,280
Do you usually change your name?

315
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,280
What's that?

316
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,280
I don't know

317
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:49,280
I changed it to something like this

318
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:53,280
Matsumoto, something, something, something

319
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:56,280
Matsumoto?

320
00:16:56,280 --> 00:17:01,280
It's a word that we don't understand

321
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:04,280
I'll go with Whiskey Coke

322
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:07,280
What?

323
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,280
Idiot!

324
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:16,280
You're saying good things

325
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:19,280
I don't know what you're talking about

326
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:23,280
Whiskey Coke is stronger

327
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:27,280
Let's go with this

328
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,280
Why?

329
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:33,280
It's something like this

330
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,280
It's something like this

331
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,280
Why? Because the main character is a crow

332
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:42,280
That's the question

333
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:46,280
After the crow, it looks delicious

334
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:48,280
What's in that?

335
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:50,280
What did you put in it?

336
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:53,280
I think it's the other way around

337
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,280
What?

338
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:57,280
Instead of being stuck in the skin and bulging

339
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:01,280
If you get stuck in the skin, it shrinks

340
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:05,280
Other than the part that got stuck

341
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,280
If you get stuck in this part

342
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:15,280
If you get stuck in this part, the whole thing shrinks

343
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,280
Only this part is left

344
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,280
That part is the memory

345
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,280
The one before

346
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:24,280
The one before you get stuck

347
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:28,280
The one before you get stuck

348
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:32,280
The skin sucks blood

349
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:34,280
If you suck blood

350
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,280
Only the amount you suck

351
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:39,280
Only the amount you suck will come out

352
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,280
This is the skin

353
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,280
You should stop that

354
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,280
No one will kill the skin

355
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:51,280
That's not good

356
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,280
That's it

357
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:56,280
If you stick your face in, that's it

358
00:18:56,280 --> 00:19:00,280
It's coming

359
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:02,280
That's not good

360
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:05,280
That's where you get killed

361
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,280
That's it

362
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:10,280
Everyone thinks that's not good

363
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:13,280
Stop it

364
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,280
On the highway

365
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:19,280
Ah

366
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:22,280
The old man on the highway

367
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:24,280
How did he get there?

368
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:26,280
I've seen it many times

369
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,280
Really?

370
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,280
Why?

371
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:32,280
They send you to a bus like Hiace

372
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:35,280
Really?

373
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:39,280
That's it

374
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:44,280
This is funny

375
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:49,280
How did he get there?

376
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,280
What?

377
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:54,280
From Arujan

378
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:56,280
The old man on the highway

379
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,280
How did he get there?

380
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:05,280
In a wagon

381
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:10,280
I've seen it many times

382
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:16,280
The punishment game

383
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,280
It's a seasonal game

384
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,280
It's a fun festival

385
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,280
That's right

386
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,280
It's a fun festival

387
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,280
It's a punishment game

388
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,280
Thank you

389
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,280
The losing team

390
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:35,280
Why are you like that?

391
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,280
It's really annoying

392
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:43,280
The reason I lost is because of this man

393
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,280
He should be good at singing

394
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,280
How many points did you get?

395
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,280
57 points

396
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,280
57 points

397
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:51,280
Koba

398
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,280
How many points did you get?

399
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,280
51 points

400
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,280
51 points

401
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:59,280
Let's go

402
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:02,280
It's hot

403
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:05,280
You're too excited

404
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,280
Who is it?

405
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:10,280
It's hot

406
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:16,280
It's hot

407
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:18,280
It's like I'm being punished

408
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:20,280
It's hot

409
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,280
It's hot

410
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,280
What is this?

411
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:26,280
It's hot

412
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:30,280
Producer, do you have a fan?

413
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:35,280
I want you to press it

414
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:38,280
Let's see your face

415
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,280
Put it on

416
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,280
It's done

417
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:44,280
I'm scared

418
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,280
He's saying he's scared

419
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,280
He's worried

420
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,280
Let's see your face

421
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:54,280
This is good

422
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:59,280
He's getting better

423
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,280
Is it good?

424
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:06,280
Let's see your face

425
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:09,280
It's good

426
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:12,280
Everyone, press it

427
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,280
It's the last punishment game

428
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:24,280
It's fun

429
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:50,280
He looks like a super saiyan
