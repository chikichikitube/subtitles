1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The next day

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I saw the sports news the other day

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Apparently you can catch 8kg of anago

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Where is it?

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Tokyo Bay

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
That's not it

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
What kind of Tohoku region is it?

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
8kg is like this

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
It's anago

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
It's just one, right?

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
It's not?

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
It's definitely not

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
It's like this

14
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
It's called anaconda

15
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
You're such a big hole.

16
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
You're a snake.

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm not a snake.

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm a person.

19
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I'm really curious about the news.

20
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Why did you dig a hole?

21
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I think there were many other things.

22
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I saw it and I wanted to dig it.

23
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Is what Hamada said last week true?

24
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:55,000
To find out, we will challenge the monster-sized hole digging in the Tokyo Bay.

25
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
In the first episode, Hamada's words are true or false?

26
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Monster-class giant Anago Tsurou!

27
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
From the beginning of the end, the octave was higher.

28
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I didn't want to go that high.

29
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
That's why I have an image of Hamada.

30
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
This is good.

31
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
It's here.

32
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
That's right.

33
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
It's not that heavy.

34
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
This is good.

35
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
8kg.

36
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
8kg.

37
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
But, you know, it's on the news.

38
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
If you catch a lot, it won't be on the news.

39
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
That's right.

40
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
You're good.

41
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
You're good at sports.

42
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
You were on it yesterday.

43
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
That's not easy to catch.

44
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Why do you have to spend 30 minutes to catch this?

45
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Get a normal one.

46
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
A normal one.

47
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
This is it.

48
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
How many kilograms is this?

49
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
This is...

50
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
It's less than 1 kilogram.

51
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
It's 150 grams.

52
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
It's 150 grams.

53
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Really? That's a lot.

54
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
What do you mean by that?

55
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
It's like sushi.

56
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
That's right.

57
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Itamae-san is strong today.

58
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
He'll grill it.

59
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
If you can make something over 8 kilograms,

60
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
you can grill it here.

61
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
That's right!

62
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Grilled with a gang-ran.

63
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Yes, yes.

64
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
However, if you can't catch a fish over 8kg,

65
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
you will be given a very expensive 8kg steak.

66
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Thank you very much!

67
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Thank you!

68
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
It's a very expensive steak.

69
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
No, no, this is definitely...

70
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Why do you have to give me a steak when I can't catch a fish?

71
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
No, I will definitely make you do that.

72
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
It's not like the nori in the show, but I will really make you do that.

73
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I will definitely make you do that with your money.

74
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:53,000
The funny thing is that we caught 7kg of fish, and it was pretty fun to watch.

75
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
And we also want to see the 8kg of steak.

76
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
We want to see the 8kg of beef.

77
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
We want to see that.

78
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
How many grams is this?

79
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
150g.

80
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
What are you talking about?

81
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
We were all like, wow.

82
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Isn't that where the fish are?

83
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Why did you say that?

84
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Why did you say that again?

85
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
This program is brought to you by the following sponsors

86
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:38,000
The five people on the boat are going at a high speed to reach the point where the giant conch will be caught

87
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
The tension is rising

88
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
You're the one who's going to fish?

89
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
You're the one who said it first

90
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
That's why I'm here

91
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
That's not right

92
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
There's no sign of fish

93
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
There's no sign of fish

94
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
It's not even out yet

95
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
What do you mean there's no sign of fish at this point?

96
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
30 minutes have passed

97
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Finally, they have reached their destination.

98
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
That red and white tower, right?

99
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
That's the point.

100
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
It's not a building.

101
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
It's just a little bit in front of it.

102
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
It seems that the girl is already up there.

103
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
This is the point, right?

104
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
No, it's Hamada-san.

105
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I'm going home.

106
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Hamada-san!

107
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I'm sorry. I'm the one who said that.

108
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
It's too cold.

109
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I've reduced the speed. It's about time.

110
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Really?

111
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Yes.

112
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
It's about time.

113
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Where are you going to take me?

114
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I'm going to make you laugh.

115
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I'm going to make you laugh.

116
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I'll be the first to get out of the stage.

117
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
You're crazy.

118
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
They finally arrive at their destination.

119
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
The five of them learn the tips of how to fish giant conch.

120
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
When you fish a conch, you have to look at it like this.

121
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
You have to look at it like this.

122
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
If you think it's heavy, you can just grab it like this.

123
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
It's difficult.

124
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
It's quite difficult.

125
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Can you film it?

126
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I can.

127
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
8kg.

128
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I can't believe you can't even lift 8kg.

129
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Really?

130
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
8kg?

131
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
As the expectations increase, the giant conch starts.

132
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
It's not like this.

133
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
It's not like this.

134
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Is it coming?

135
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
What? Is it coming?

136
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I don't know.

137
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Don't be so negative.

138
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
It's funny.

139
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I'm pulling it, but it's not working.

140
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
He's a bad guy.

141
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
He's like a CM Matagi.

142
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Don't think so much.

143
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
It's scary.

144
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I want to see it.

145
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I want to catch it.

146
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I'm scared.

147
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
That's not true.

148
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
It's not a good story.

149
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Without any sign of success, 15 minutes have passed since the start.

150
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
His expression has gradually become more fierce.

151
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I can't draw that kind of thing.

152
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I'll go to the front.

153
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I'm not sure.

154
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Ah, this is not it.

155
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
He doesn't seem to be motivated.

156
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I can't believe it.

157
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
He said it himself.

158
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
He's trying to blame it on Endo.

159
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
He's trying to make me angry.

160
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I was wondering what he would do, but it was faster than I thought.

161
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
He was on the way.

162
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
This is a bit...

163
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I'm not sure.

164
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
This is a bit...

165
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Which one will it be?

166
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I don't know.

167
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I can't catch anything.

168
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
The anxiety between the five began to grow.

169
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
At that time...

170
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Ah!

171
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Eh?

172
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
It may have come!

173
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Not yet, not yet.

174
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
It's coming, it's coming.

175
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Eh, really?

176
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
It's coming.

177
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Here?

178
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Here?

179
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Here?

180
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I'm not wearing it.

181
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I'm not wearing it.

182
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Oh, you're wearing it.

183
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
You're wearing it, right?

184
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
You're wearing it.

185
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
It moved!

186
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
It's coming!

187
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
It's coming!

188
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Go! Go!

189
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Hurry up and wear it!

190
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
My head hurts!

191
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Wait a minute.

192
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:08,500
Really?

193
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,000
It's you, right?

194
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,500
Right?

195
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,500
You're fishing for a boat, right?

196
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Wow, it's huge!

197
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Wow, amazing!

198
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,500
This is still a baby.

199
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,000
What?

200
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,500
This is still a baby?

201
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,500
The chin is like a cat's.

202
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,500
Like a cat's chin.

203
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:40,500
He caught the first big fish, but it was still far from 8 km.

204
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:44,500
And the time of silence begins again.

205
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,500
Hamada-san!

206
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,500
What?

207
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,500
Hamada-san!

208
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,500
Why?

209
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,500
It's not going at all.

210
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,500
I caught it.

211
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,500
8 km.

212
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,500
I said it was about 1 km.

213
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,500
It's 8 times of this.

214
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,500
It's not a big deal.

215
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,500
You did it like this, right?

216
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,500
Like this.

217
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,500
Like this, right?

218
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,500
I'll tell you.

219
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,500
It's a hole.

220
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,500
It's a hole, right?

221
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,500
It's a hole.

222
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,500
It's not over yet.

223
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:26,500
Time passes without a sign of the second one.

224
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:30,500
The giant hole that causes 8kg still doesn't exist?

225
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,500
At that time, a hit came after a long time

226
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,500
It's coming! It's coming!

227
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,500
Put your weight on it! Put your weight on it!

228
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,500
It's coming! It's coming!

229
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,500
Stand up! Stand up!

230
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,500
Oh, it's coming!

231
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,500
Is it big?

232
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,500
Wow, it's big!

233
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,500
Wow, it's big!

234
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,500
Wow, it's big!

235
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,500
It's bigger than the one before.

236
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,500
It's bigger than the one before.

237
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,500
Wow!

238
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,500
Wow!

239
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,500
Wow!

240
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,500
Look, it's 8kg!

241
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,500
8kg is...

242
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,500
It's pretty heavy, isn't it?

243
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,500
It's heavy.

244
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:22,500
It's bigger than the one before, right?

245
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,500
It's bigger.

246
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:29,500
The sun is setting, and it's time to catch a huge fish.

247
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:33,500
It's already rising.

248
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,500
It's a solo fish.

249
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,500
Will it be 8kg?

250
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,500
From now on?

251
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:43,500
Once he regained his motivation, this man...

252
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,500
The man is...

253
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,500
What the hell are you doing?

254
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,500
Wow, it's huge!

255
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,500
It's huge!

256
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,500
It's 8kg!

257
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,500
8kg! It's 8kg!

258
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,500
It's heavy!

259
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,500
It's heavy!

260
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,500
It's 8kg!

261
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,500
It's heavy!

262
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,500
This is amazing.

263
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,500
It's heavy!

264
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:10,500
Wow!

265
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,500
It's a red cone!

266
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,500
That's why I said it!

267
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,500
What is this?

268
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,500
It's like a little lover's village.

269
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,500
It's like this village.

270
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,500
I have a lot of fish.

271
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,500
You should practice.

272
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,500
It's May soon.

273
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,500
May is the birth month.

274
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,500
It's not a birth month.

275
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,500
Wait a minute.

276
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,500
This is amazing.

277
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,500
Look at this.

278
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,500
I told you.

279
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,500
I told you.

280
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:03,500
I caught three fish, but the scale is getting bigger.

281
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:08,500
I've seen bigger ones than the one before.

282
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,500
What?

283
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,500
That size?

284
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,500
I want to see it.

285
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,500
I want to see it too.

286
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,500
That size is amazing.

287
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,500
Oh, it's coming again.

288
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,500
The order is amazing.

289
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,500
It's coming to me.

290
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,500
I'm down?

291
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,500
I'm coming.

292
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,500
It's coming!

293
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,500
It's coming!

294
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,500
It's coming!

295
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,500
It's coming!

296
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:41,500
Wow, that's frustrating!

297
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,500
That was amazing!

298
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,500
What?

299
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,500
It's not a ton, it's a ton!

300
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,500
It's not 8kg, it's a ton!

301
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,500
It's 1 ton!

302
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,500
It's 1 ton?

303
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,500
It's like a ton!

304
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:56,500
The huge hole is starting to appear one after another as they approach the time limit of the plaster.

305
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:59,500
Hurry! Hurry!

306
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,500
I want to do this too.

307
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,500
The rain is coming!

308
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,500
It's coming! It's coming!

309
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,500
It's coming!

310
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,500
It's coming!

311
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,500
Roll it! Roll it!

312
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,500
Roll it! Roll it!

313
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,500
It's huge!

314
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,500
Takadan-sama!

315
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,500
Don't look at me!

316
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,500
Wait, wait!

317
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,500
It's too big!

318
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:37,500
It's coming!

319
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:40,500
It's big, but it's smaller than the one before.

320
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:43,500
It's coming!

321
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,500
It's big!

322
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,500
It's big!

323
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,500
It's big!

324
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,500
It's big!

325
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,500
Is it a sea bass?

326
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,500
It's a sea bass.

327
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,500
Wow, it's huge!

328
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,500
It's huge!

329
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,500
It's huge!

330
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,500
It's huge!

331
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,500
It's long.

332
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,500
Wow, it's amazing.

333
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,500
It's really amazing.

334
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,500
Wait, it's just me.

335
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,500
I want you to experience this.

336
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,500
I want you to experience this.

337
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,500
Thank you.

338
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,500
Only Matsumoto hasn't caught anything yet.

339
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:25,500
Will Matsumoto be able to get the answer?

340
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,500
This is all I have.

341
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:31,500
I thought I had it, but I was wrong.

342
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,500
He is trying to find out where Matsumoto is.

343
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,500
He is trying to find out where Matsumoto is.

344
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,500
Is there another one?

345
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,500
Yes, there is.

346
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,500
Matsumoto-san, you are...

347
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,500
I got it! I got it!

348
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:54,500
You are not aware of it.

349
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:58,500
You are being told.

350
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:01,500
No one can tell me.

351
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:05,500
Go to the endo.

352
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,500
Go to the endo.

353
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:10,500
Wow.

354
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:22,500
The flowers of life are blooming in the valley of the waves.

355
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,500
Wow, another big one!

356
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,500
Wow, it's big!

357
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,500
It's big!

358
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,500
It's big!

359
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:38,500
Wow!

360
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,500
This is amazing!

361
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,500
Hold him! Hold him!

362
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,500
Hold him! Hold him!

363
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,500
Hold him!

364
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,500
Hold him!

365
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,500
Look at his face!

366
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,500
Why are you holding him?

367
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:03,500
Look at his face!

368
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:10,500
He is fond of the fish.

369
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:14,500
It is heavy.

370
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:19,500
Hama-san, please do your best.

371
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:22,500
Hama-san, please do your best!

372
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:25,500
This is so heavy.

373
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,500
Oh, it's big!

374
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:35,500
It's big!

375
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,500
It's really big.

376
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,500
Wow.

377
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,500
It's strange.

378
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,500
It's amazing.

379
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:58,500
I caught this one.

380
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,500
I got it.

381
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,500
It's big.

382
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,500
This is big.

383
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,500
Wrap it more.

384
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:11,500
More.

385
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,500
More.

386
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:15,500
Let's put it in the net.

387
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,500
You look like you're doing something.

388
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:23,500
What are you doing on a boat?

389
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,500
It's huge!

390
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,500
Really?

391
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:29,500
Wow!

392
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:33,500
It's huge!

393
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:36,500
It's huge!

394
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:39,500
Get in! Hurry up and get in!

395
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,500
This is no good!

396
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,500
It's huge!

397
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,500
It's thick!

398
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,500
This is huge.

399
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,500
All of them are like this.

400
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,500
Huge.

401
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,500
And the squid is...

402
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,500
It's like this.

403
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:57,500
I haven't eaten all of them.

404
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,500
Thick.

405
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,500
This is amazing.

406
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,500
This is huge.

407
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,500
This must be 8 kg.

408
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:08,500
Huge.

409
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,500
This is definitely something.

410
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,500
This is definitely something.

411
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,500
This is amazing.

412
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:17,500
It's so big!

413
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,500
It's big, isn't it?

414
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:25,500
While the fish are being caught one by one, Matsumoto still can't catch any.

415
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:30,500
There is only a little time left.

416
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,500
At that time...

417
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,500
Ah! Matsumoto! Matsumoto!

418
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,500
What are you doing?

419
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,500
Ah!

420
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,500
It's coming! It's coming! It's coming!

421
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,500
It's coming, isn't it?

422
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,500
You're really...

423
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,500
It's a new one!

424
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,500
It's coming, right?

425
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,500
It's coming!

426
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,500
It's the last one.

427
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,500
It's coming!

428
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,500
Is it coming this time?

429
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,500
It's big!

430
00:18:56,500 --> 00:19:00,500
It's a normal anago.

431
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:04,500
It's about 150cm.

432
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,500
Huh?

433
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,500
It's coming!

434
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,500
It's small!

435
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,500
It's small!

436
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,500
What is this?

437
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,500
I'm embarrassed.

438
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:27,500
It's the first time that everyone is happy with this.

439
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,500
Are you ready?

440
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:30,500
Yes.

441
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,500
Are you ready, Hama-san?

442
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:35,500
I said, are you ready? You understand what I said, right?

443
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,500
But this...

444
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,500
We haven't measured it yet.

445
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,500
We haven't measured it yet.

446
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:44,500
The two fish you caught were quite big.

447
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,500
It was indeed thick.

448
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,500
It was indeed a bit surprising.

449
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,500
It was amazing.

450
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:55,500
But it's said that there are still twice as many fish as that.

451
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:58,500
That's not true.

452
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,500
That's not true.

453
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,500
No, no, no, this is true.

454
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:05,500
Let's measure it again.

455
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:10,500
If it's over 8kg, we'll eat the anago.

456
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:14,500
If it's not, we'll go to the steak restaurant.

457
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,500
You guys are a little scared.

458
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:20,500
We'll see if we can measure it.

459
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,500
The result is out!

460
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,500
Thank you!

461
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,500
We should do it.

462
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:32,500
I'm not sure about the popularity of this place.

463
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,500
I'm a big guy.

464
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,500
No, you're not.

465
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,500
You're so small.

466
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,500
Yamazaki-san is one.

467
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,500
Kurosu-san is one.

468
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,500
Tama-san is two.

469
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,500
I'm six.

470
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,500
Tanaka is two.

471
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,500
There are 12 of them in total.

472
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:56,500
If there are more than 8kg, we can eat them.

473
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:59,500
If not, I'll go with 8kg steak.

474
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,500
I want to fill my stomach with anything.

475
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,500
Look at this.

476
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:05,500
If you look at it like this, it's a shark.

477
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,500
It's a shark.

478
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,500
It's as big as a water tank.

479
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:11,500
Well, we can't help it if we measure it.

480
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,500
The biggest one is already...

481
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,500
The biggest one?

482
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:16,500
This one.

483
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,500
This is 11.12.

484
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:24,500
If you weigh it, it's amazing.

485
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:25,500
Let's measure it right away.

486
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,500
How many kilograms is this bucket?

487
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:28,500
This is 1 kilogram.

488
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,500
It's already been pulled out.

489
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:30,500
It's already been pulled out.

490
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,500
The numbers that came out here are the same.

491
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,500
Really?

492
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,500
This one looks smaller, but it's not.

493
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,500
This one is bigger.

494
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,500
I'm begging you, the steak is huge.

495
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,500
Now, that's...

496
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,500
I can't eat this.

497
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,500
The steak is good.

498
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,500
How about this?

499
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:44,500
It's over 8 kilograms.

500
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:45,500
It's really bad.

501
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:46,500
I'll eat it.

502
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,500
Is it over 8 kilograms?

503
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,500
The result is...

504
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:51,500
this!

505
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:52,500
Wow!

506
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,500
Wow!

507
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,500
That 4 times!

508
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,500
8.3kg!

509
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,500
We did it!

510
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,500
Wow, it was all real!

511
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,500
This is amazing!

512
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,500
Well, no matter how much you pull, it's still over 8kg.

513
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,500
That's right.

514
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:20,500
Immediately, they will cut the 8kg giant conger eel and make a conger eel bowl.

515
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,500
Ah, it smells good.

516
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,500
It smells good.

517
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:26,500
It's a little different from this.

518
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,500
Yes.

519
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,500
It smells good.

520
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,500
That's the end.

521
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,500
Ah, this is the end.

522
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,500
Is this me?

523
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,500
Amazing.

524
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,500
What is this?

525
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,500
What is this?

526
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:51,500
This is Tanaka.

527
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,500
Wow, it's huge.

528
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,500
Mr. Hamada, this is for you.

529
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,500
The one on the left is for you.

530
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:58,500
Thank you.

531
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:59,500
That's mine?

532
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:00,500
That's right.

533
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:01,500
That's yours.

534
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,500
That's mine.

535
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:11,500
What is this?

536
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:12,500
Thank you.

537
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,500
Why didn't you give me a high-five?

538
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:17,500
Let's eat.

539
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,500
Wow, it's a little hard.

540
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,500
Wow, it's hard.

541
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,500
Don't complain all the time.

542
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:25,500
Wow, it's true.

543
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,500
Wow, it's really good.

544
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,500
It's hard.

545
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:33,500
It's dry.

546
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,500
It's hard.

547
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:36,500
It's hard.

548
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:40,500
The rice doesn't come out.

549
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:41,500
How did you eat this?

550
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:42,500
Well, it's okay.

551
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:45,500
Hey, I'm scared.

552
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,500
It's not good.
