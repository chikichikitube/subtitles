1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Gakki no Tsukai's special project, Pichihenge, where comedians put their pride on the line and challenge themselves to make people laugh.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Up until now, many members, as well as comedians and staff, have challenged themselves to this project.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
They put their own ideas of laughter and their own sense of humor into it, and have expressed themselves with all their heart and soul.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Among them is that beast in Matsumoto Produce.

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Tonight, that person who is currently doing well will be challenging himself.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The first episode of Gakki no Tsukai is brought to you by Chikichiki and Cream Stew!

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
They say I'm on a roll.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
You're on a roll wherever you put it.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
But when I look at this, I think, is there anything special about this?

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
That's what I think.

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Why?

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Because it's true.

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Today's star, please come on out!

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I just saw a little bit of Arita tripping over.

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
This time, it's Cream Stew, but it's Arita.

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
That's right.

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
What do you think?

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Don't you think the one on top was better?

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
That's right.

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I've seen most of it, though.

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
You can cry.

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
It's like he's doing a tsukkomi, and he's going to make up for it with revenge.

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I see.

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
It's very unpleasant to think that he's going to make up for it first.

25
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
What do you think, Ueda-kun?

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Even if I get a request, I won't do it.

27
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Arita, where do you want to aim for?

28
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I'm a man who aims to be a regular on Gakki no Tsukai.

29
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
If I think that way, I think I'll have to take off Tanaka-kun.

30
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
You're not a regular around here, are you?

31
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Well, around here, yes.

32
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
He'll be done in March, too.

33
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
He'll be done in March.

34
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Is that so?

35
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
It's really low.

36
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
This program is brought to you by the following sponsors.

37
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
What should we do?

38
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
What should we do?

39
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I'm the second generation K-4.

40
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Hamada Tsuji is the correct answer.

41
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
That's right.

42
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
That's right.

43
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
This is good.

44
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I heard that you watched the National Assembly.

45
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I didn't watch it.

46
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
You were looking at it, right?

47
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I was looking at it.

48
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I didn't watch it.

49
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
This is good.

50
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I don't really understand the meaning of this.

51
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
What is it?

52
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
It means to eat, right?

53
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Do you eat gorillas?

54
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
That's right.

55
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I think there's something.

56
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I'm sorry.

57
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I'll be in the room for a while.

58
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I'll be in the room for a while.

59
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I don't want to talk about dinner.

60
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I don't like that either.

61
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I don't like that either.

62
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I'm in the middle of a meeting.

63
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I'm in the middle of a meeting.

64
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
See you later.

65
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I'm sorry.

66
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I don't want to talk about dinner.

67
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I can't see it.

68
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I can't see it.

69
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
It's the meat.

70
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I'm sorry.

71
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I'm sorry.

72
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I'm sorry.

73
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I'm sorry.

74
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Get out of here.

75
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Get out of here.

76
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
He laughed completely.

77
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I'm sorry.

78
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Yamagaki was a little weird.

79
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
What is it?

80
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
The first one, too.

81
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
It was weak.

82
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
What?

83
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Can you do it?

84
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Not yet.

85
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I can't do it until I laugh.

86
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Mr. Joshua.

87
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
What is it?

88
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Mr. Joshua.

89
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Can I talk to you?

90
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Yes.

91
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
You won today's game.

92
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
How was your opponent?

93
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I was touched.

94
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I was touched.

95
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
It's completely different from the opponent.

96
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Didn't you get cut off on the way?

97
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I didn't get cut off.

98
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I didn't get cut off.

99
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
It's a big deal if I get cut off.

100
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
It's a big deal if I get cut off.

101
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
But it's only after I get cut off.

102
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
It's only after I get cut off.

103
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
It's only after I get cut off.

104
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I didn't get cut off.

105
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:39,000
If I get cut off, I can't go home.

106
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I didn't get cut off.

107
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I see.

108
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I'm sorry to ask you a private question.

109
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Don't ask me weird questions.

110
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Will you go to the Wind Tribe?

111
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I won't go to the Wind Tribe.

112
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I won't go to the Wind Tribe.

113
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I won't go to the Wind Tribe.

114
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Even if I go, I'll lose weight.

115
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I'll lose weight.

116
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
But it's only after I get cut off.

117
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
It's only after I get cut off.

118
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
It's only after I get cut off.

119
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,000
If I get cut off, I can't go home.

120
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
It's only after I get cut off.

121
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I won't go.

122
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I won't go.

123
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I'll write it down.

124
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Okay. Thank you.

125
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
It's dirty.

126
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
It's dirty.

127
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
It's dirty.

128
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
It's dirty.

129
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
It's dirty.

130
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
It's dirty.

131
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I'm watching the story.

132
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
That's a lot.

133
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
That's a lot.

134
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I've been watching that story since I was in high school.

135
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Really?

136
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,000
When I came in, I was embarrassed when I opened my eyes.

137
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I can't get over my fear.

138
00:06:48,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I can't get over my fear.

139
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,000
What's in this box?

140
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
What is this?

141
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
What is this?

142
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I'll pull it a little more.

143
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I can't do it.

144
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
What is it?

145
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Don't pull it.

146
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Don't pull it.

147
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
What is this?

148
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
What is it?

149
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
What is it?

150
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
What is it?

151
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
What is it?

152
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
It's not.

153
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I'll turn it around.

154
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
What is it?

155
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Three times.

156
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Stop it.

157
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
What is it?

158
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
What is it?

159
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
What about the eyes?

160
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
The eyes are big.

161
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
This is scary.

162
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
What is this?

163
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I see.

164
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
You're really into it.

165
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I'm totally into it.

166
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
You're really into it.

167
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
My body is cowardly.

168
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Did you see the chomei?

169
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
It's dirty.

170
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
It's big.

171
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
It really says, what is it?

172
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Is that so?

173
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
It even has a question mark.

174
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
What is it?

175
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I can do anything if I have energy.

176
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I'm always doing it today.

177
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:11,000
There is a person who wants to do it.

178
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Come out.

179
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
How old are you?

180
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I'm 22.

181
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
22.

182
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Put your strength in your stomach.

183
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Let's go.

184
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Come out.

185
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Let's go.

186
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Put your strength in your stomach.

187
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Come out.

188
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
What is it?

189
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
You're a girl.

190
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
How old are you?

191
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I'm 26.

192
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
26.

193
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Put your strength in your stomach.

194
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Come out.

195
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
What are you doing?

196
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Let's go.

197
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Put your strength in your stomach.

198
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Don't touch me.

199
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Thank you.

200
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
That was close.

201
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
That was close.

202
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
That was close.

203
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
2 out of 4 is pro wrestling.

204
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
That's right.

205
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I thought it was pro wrestling.

206
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I like pro wrestling.

207
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Pro wrestling is pro wrestling, but not pro wrestling.

208
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Pro wrestling is pro wrestling, but not pro wrestling.

209
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Hello?

210
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Ken-chan?

211
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
This is Fukubiki.

212
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Come on.

213
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
It's late at night.

214
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
No, no.

215
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Put it in karaoke.

216
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Put it in karaoke.

217
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Salmon flakes.

218
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
This song sounds like this.

219
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I found it again.

220
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:23,000
It starts with a song.

221
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Listen to it.

222
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:53,000
It starts with a song.

223
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Ken-chan?

224
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
This is Fukubiki.

225
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Can you give me a new album?

226
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I want to listen to it.

227
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Lobby.

228
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Why did you laugh like that?

229
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Why did you laugh like that?

230
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:25,000
It's funny.

231
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I'm sorry.

232
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:32,000
It's okay.

233
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I see.

234
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Why are you angry?

235
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Why are you angry?

236
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
We're in the middle of a meeting.

237
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
We're in the middle of a meeting.

238
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Why are you angry?

239
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I'm going to sing a song at the wedding.

240
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I've decided.

241
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
That's good.

242
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Everyone is good.

243
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Why did you decide?

244
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I like the popular songs.

245
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
That's good.

246
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I don't care what it is.

247
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
That's good.

248
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Let's practice.

249
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
We're in the middle of a meeting.

250
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I don't care what it is.

251
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Let's practice.

252
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I'll sing.

253
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I can't hear you.

254
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I can't hear you.

255
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I don't care what it is.

256
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I'll sing.

257
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,000
We're in the middle of a meeting.

258
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Let's practice.

259
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I don't care what it is.

260
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Let's practice.

261
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I'll sing.

262
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I don't care what it is.

263
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
I'm sorry.

264
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I don't care what it is.

265
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I'm sorry.

266
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I don't care what it is.

267
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I'll sing.

268
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Yama.

269
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Yes.

270
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I did my best.

271
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I did my best.

272
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:53,000
It's a long song.

273
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I'm popular now.

274
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Please come to the shampoo stand.

275
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Where are you from?

276
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Thank you.

277
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Where is the hair dryer?

278
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Hair dryer?

279
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Is it a hair dryer?

280
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Is it here?

281
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
A little more to the left.

282
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Is it here?

283
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
A little more.

284
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Is it here?

285
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:41,000
It's close.

286
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Is it here?

287
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
A little more.

288
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Is it here?

289
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
A little more.

290
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
It's close.

291
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
It's close.

292
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Is there anything else I can do for you?

293
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I drank my foot roller.

294
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Is it good?

295
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Bring it to me!

296
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Bring it to me!

297
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Bring it to me!

298
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Bring it to me!

299
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
What is that!

300
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I'm going to make you laugh.

301
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Let's see.

302
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Here you go.

303
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Thank you.

304
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
The total is ¥38,000.

305
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Congratulations!

306
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
That's amazing.

307
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
That's amazing.

308
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
¥38,000.

309
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Thank you.

310
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
That was close.

311
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
The one before was a bit more expensive.

312
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
That's right.

313
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
That's right.

314
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Inoki was also a bit more expensive.

315
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Inoki was also expensive.

316
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
I wanted to ask you.

317
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I wanted to ask you.

318
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
What is Fukubiki?

319
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,000
It's a movie called Fukubiki Seikichi.

320
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
It's just Fukubiki.

321
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
It's just Fukubiki.

322
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
It's just Fukubiki.

323
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
This year is the Asian party!

324
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Hamada's Asian party!

325
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Hamada's Asian party!

326
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Let me go first!

327
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
This year is the Asian party!

328
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Hamada's Asian party!

329
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
But as expected, Mama is...

330
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
That's amazing.

331
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
That's amazing.

332
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
That's amazing.

333
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
That's amazing.

334
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
That's amazing.

335
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
I can do this for 2 or 3 years.

336
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
¥38,000.

337
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
¥38,000.

338
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I don't really like saying this, but...

339
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Yamagaki has a house.

340
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
That's amazing.

341
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I went to see it.

342
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
That Yamazaki! That stupid Yamazaki!

343
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
He built a house around here!

344
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
That's amazing.

345
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
That's amazing.

346
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:33,000
He's living there with his stupid wife and stupid child.

347
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Hamada doesn't have any girls, right?

348
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
When he has a girl, he's like that.

349
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
He has 2 girls.

350
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
The older one isn't even 2 years old yet.

351
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
He doesn't really care about his wife.

352
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
He bought a diaper next door.

353
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I think he's about 1 and a half years old.

354
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
To be honest, he's completely naked.

355
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
It doesn't really matter.

356
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
He's a kid.

357
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
It doesn't really matter to me.

358
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Yamagaki, hey.

359
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Oh, you're going to do it there?

360
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I'm going to do it there.

361
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Everyone's going to see it.

362
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Don't show it!

363
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Don't show it!

364
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
It doesn't really matter.

365
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
That guy is funny.

366
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
His wife says,

367
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,000
If Momo grows up, will you marry Matsumoto?

368
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
He's like,

369
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,000
If Momo grows up and becomes 20, Matsumoto will be 60.

370
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
He looks at Yamagaki.

371
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
He's not bad at all.

372
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
He's not bad at all.

373
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
He's not bad at all.

374
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
I'm scared of Yamagaki.

375
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
If he grows up a little more, what will he do?

376
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
What will he do?

377
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
I don't know.

378
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Enzo is also a woman.

379
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Everyone is a woman, right?

380
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
That's right.

381
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Only Hamada is like this.

382
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
But he's like this.

383
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Dad!

384
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Dad, I'm...

385
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Yes, he's a man.

386
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
He's like that.

387
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
He doesn't smoke.

388
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
He doesn't smoke at all.

389
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
He has a child and lives in Shinjuku.

390
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Yamagaki doesn't smoke.

391
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
He does, but everyone smokes on the veranda.

392
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
I'm...

393
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I'm a very careful person.

394
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
What?

395
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I don't think everyone understands this.

396
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
When I made my juniors,

397
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
I was like,

398
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
What are you going to bring?

399
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Because I'm a dad.

400
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
You think so, right?

401
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I'm very careful.

402
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Really?

403
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
I took my juniors with me.

404
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Kimu, me, and the rest of the juniors.

405
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
I rented two rooms.

406
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
One for my room and one for the juniors.

407
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Kimu's room and two juniors.

408
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I'm in the same hotel as my juniors.

409
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:21,000
I'm like a woman when I'm sleeping or peeing.

410
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Why?

411
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
I'm sorry if I wake you up in a hurry.

412
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Wait a minute.

413
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
What are you talking about?

414
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
No, no, no, no, no.

415
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
That's not true.

416
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
That's because you're a fool.

417
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Dad, ah.

418
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
That's not true.

419
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Do you think it's going to be popular?

420
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Are you kidding me?

421
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
It's true.

422
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
And I don't let you sleep.

423
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Why don't you let me sleep?

424
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
I'm sorry if I wake you up in a hurry.

425
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
What are you talking about?

426
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
But the juniors are fine.

427
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
I'm going to sleep.

428
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
That's what I'm talking about.

429
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
On the night of the second day,

430
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
When we were having dinner,

431
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
I told them that I was this careful.

432
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Kimu was very impressed.

433
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Did you guys hear that?

434
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
I told him that I was going to sleep.

435
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Kimu was so happy.

436
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
I'm sorry if I wake you up in a hurry.

437
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
I'm sorry if I wake you up in a hurry.

438
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
You guys, get out of here.

439
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
And that's what happened.

440
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
On the night of the third day,

441
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Kimu and the other juniors were sleeping.

442
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
The three of them were sleeping.

443
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
I told them that I wanted to go to the bathroom.

444
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
I was thinking about what to do.

445
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
I was wondering if we should all wake up a little later.

446
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
I was wondering what to do for the next hour.

447
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
There's a little guy named Hashimoto.

448
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
He's little, and he's scared.

449
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
He went into the bathroom.

450
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Without making any sound,

451
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Hashimoto came back and said,

452
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
I heard what you said yesterday.

453
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
I was glad I told you.

454
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
I opened the door and I heard you.

455
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
I opened the door and I heard you.

456
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
He's a shit.

457
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
I'm going to throw up.

458
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
I'm going to throw up.

459
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
I'm going to throw up.

460
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
I'm going to throw up.

461
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Kimu.

462
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:12,000
I can't believe it!

463
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
That sound made me fall in love with another girl!

464
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:35,000
