1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
This is the 6th episode of Nenmatsu Kourei Taiketsu!

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Who will be the winner of the 6th episode?

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Hello, hello.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Good evening.

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Well...

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Who will be the winner of the 6th episode?

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
The 6th episode? That's a big deal.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
That's right.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Up until now, we've been talking about the outside of the house.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
What is this?

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
We've been talking about it.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
But this time, inside the house...

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I went inside.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
It's a nice beach.

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
It's a beach in front of the island.

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Today is a little different from last year.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Shall we take a look?

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Let's take a look.

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
These are the members.

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The host of the red group is Mr. Kaminuma Emiko.

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Right?

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
This person...

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Yes?

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
It's his first appearance on TV.

25
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Who is this?

26
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
This is Mr. Okamoto.

27
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Do you call him Okamoto Mayo?

28
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
That's right.

29
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Moro?

30
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I don't know.

31
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
You can say that.

32
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Moro is Moro Okada.

33
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
This is the person you've been thinking about.

34
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Who is this person?

35
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Hana?

36
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Hana?

37
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
It's Hana, right?

38
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
It's Hana, right?

39
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
It's Hana, right?

40
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
It's Hana.

41
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Look.

42
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
What kind of costume will Satchan wear this year?

43
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I don't know.

44
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I'm not talking about this person.

45
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
It's the title of the song.

46
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Who is this?

47
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I don't know how many people are here today.

48
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Hana is the only one who can sing.

49
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Hana is the only one who can sing?

50
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
It's not selling.

51
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
It stinks.

52
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Wait.

53
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Wait.

54
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Let's listen to Hana.

55
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Let's listen to Hana.

56
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
It's the same.

57
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
It's the same.

58
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
It's the same.

59
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
It's the same.

60
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
It's the same.

61
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
It's the same.

62
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
It's the same.

63
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
It's completely different.

64
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Wait.

65
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I know if you listen to this.

66
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
This is selling.

67
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Tomorrow.

68
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I'll tell you if I know.

69
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
This is selling.

70
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I know.

71
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I don't know.

72
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I don't know.

73
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
You're lying.

74
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I know if you listen to this.

75
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
This is selling.

76
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I know.

77
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I'll tell you if I know.

78
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I'll tell you if I know.

79
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Wait a minute.

80
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I'm curious about something.

81
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
What is this?

82
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
It says Nakamura Mitsuko.

83
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I'm used to Hana.

84
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
You're used to Hana.

85
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
This is a difficult part.

86
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
If I say too much...

87
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I don't have Hana.

88
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I'm used to Hana.

89
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Everyone did their best.

90
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
You're dirty.

91
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
This is difficult.

92
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
It's definitely difficult.

93
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Who?

94
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Gozen-sama.

95
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
What?

96
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
What is Gozen-sama?

97
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
It's a song.

98
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Mifune Kazuko-san.

99
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Asagata.

100
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Look at this.

101
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Gomutaina.

102
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
What?

103
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Gozen-sama Gomutaina.

104
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Gozen-sama Gomutaina.

105
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I'm used to Hana.

106
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
What are you talking about?

107
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Let's take a look at the white ones.

108
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Shikai Furutashi-san.

109
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Yes.

110
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Kitashima-san.

111
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Old man.

112
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Old man.

113
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Tani.

114
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Tani.

115
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
That's good.

116
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Kenji Odawa.

117
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Well, well.

118
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
H-Jungle.

119
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I don't know.

120
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
What?

121
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Hiromiko.

122
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Does Hiromiko come out?

123
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
It comes out.

124
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
It sold well.

125
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Yes.

126
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Akira Kogai.

127
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Atsuki Kokoroni.

128
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
But it's natural that it comes out like this.

129
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Ah, the song.

130
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
It doesn't come out.

131
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Sharankyu.

132
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Yes.

133
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
This is the end of this year.

134
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Please do your best from the beginning to the end.

135
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
You really hate Sharankyu, don't you?

136
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
No, no, no.

137
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I hate him.

138
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I hate him.

139
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Everyone thinks so.

140
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Ah, ah, ah.

141
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
But I'm cheering for him to do his best.

142
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Hosokawa Takahashi.

143
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Fuji Fumiya.

144
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Tobaichiro.

145
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
What is this?

146
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
T-O-K-I-O.

147
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Right?

148
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
T-O-K-I-O.

149
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
You know.

150
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Don't say that you know.

151
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
What?

152
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
You are really...

153
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
What?

154
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
You are really worse than me.

155
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
You are really...

156
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I can't say anything else.

157
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Why?

158
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
You can't say anything else.

159
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Why?

160
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Well, well.

161
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I've been watching it so far.

162
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I'm sure the audience has noticed it.

163
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I'm sure you've noticed it, too.

164
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
What?

165
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Obviously, this time the castle wins.

166
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Well, I don't know.

167
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
The costumes here are also eye-catching.

168
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
In the last two or three years.

169
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Well, En-chan.

170
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Well, I want to see it.

171
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
For example, let's give the audience a round of applause.

172
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
The person who says the castle wins.

173
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I can't laugh at such a thing.

174
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Right?

175
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
The person who says the red team loses.

176
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Applause.

177
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Which one?

178
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
The person who says the red team wins.

179
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Look.

180
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
The person who says the red team loses.

181
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
The person who says the red team wins.

182
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Well, well.

183
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I don't care about the opinions of the people who are here.

184
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
The problem is the actual performance.

185
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
The actual performance.

186
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
There are quite a few people who appeared for the first time.

187
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Do you understand?

188
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Then you go to the red team.

189
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
What are you talking about?

190
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Don't say strange things.

191
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I'm in the white team.

192
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
What?

193
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
No, that's enough.

194
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
What?

195
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
White.

196
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Wait a minute.

197
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
What do you mean by white?

198
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
No matter how you think about it, it's white.

199
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
It's annoying.

200
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
What is annoying?

201
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I don't like the red team.

202
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
What?

203
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
No matter how you think about it, it's red.

204
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
What should we do?

205
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
What should we do?

206
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I said it before.

207
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Here.

208
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
It's like this.

209
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I wonder if it will be negative.

210
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Sometimes it's like this.

211
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
My body is shaking.

212
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
What should we do?

213
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
It doesn't matter.

214
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Even if it shakes a little.

215
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
It's shaking to have an effect.

216
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
It's shaking to calculate.

217
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I'm doing it to be called cute.

218
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Let's play a game.

219
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Let's play a game.

220
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
If you lose, I'll go to the red team.

221
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I don't care if you go to the red team.

222
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
If I lose, I won't go to the red team.

223
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
That's right.

224
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
What is this?

225
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
There is a mistake.

226
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:47,000
If you pull it, the trigger will work.

227
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
What do you mean?

228
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I can't do it like this.

229
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
But I pulled it out once.

230
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
What?

231
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
What?

232
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
What about the potato?

233
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
What is this?

234
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
This is the usual.

235
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Badminton black beard.

236
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
What?

237
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Can I do it?

238
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I'll do it.

239
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Badminton will start when it floats.

240
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I did it last year, too.

241
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Let's do this.

242
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Let's do this.

243
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Let's do this.

244
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
What?

245
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I have to hold this.

246
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
If you do this and float, I'll shoot.

247
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
That's impossible.

248
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I have to wait once.

249
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
It's better to come out.

250
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Why?

251
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Why?

252
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
If you don't shoot in a hurry, it's over.

253
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:54,000
It's hard to do this.

254
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Don't do it when I'm doing the potato.

255
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
You're the one who broke the potato.

256
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Don't do that.

257
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I'll do it.

258
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I'll show you how to use it.

259
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I didn't expect it to be so fast.

260
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I'll show you how to use it.

261
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
You're smiling.

262
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,000
You didn't notice that I was imitating Makoto, did you?

263
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I'm sorry. I didn't notice it, either.

264
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I'll do it again.

265
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I'm sorry.

266
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I'm sorry.

267
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I'm sorry.

268
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I just said that.

269
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I love you.

270
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I thought I saw you up close.

271
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I thought I saw you up close.

272
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Your face is red.

273
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I'm glad.

274
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I'm glad.

275
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Hello.

276
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Hello.

277
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
It's the end of the year, isn't it?

278
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Yes.

279
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
It's already the end of the year.

280
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
This year, too...

281
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I'm being bitten by something.

282
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Maybe it's because I'm stressed out.

283
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
My body is going crazy.

284
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Here and here.

285
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
It's a double.

286
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
It's a double.

287
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
It's a double.

288
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
It's a double.

289
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
It's a double.

290
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Really?

291
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Yes, it's been a year.

292
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
A lot has happened.

293
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
It's been a hard year.

294
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Do you have any big news this year?

295
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I don't have any.

296
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
The biggest mystery this year is...

297
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
There's a show called Hei Hei Hei.

298
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Tsuyoshi Nakabuchi will appear.

299
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
This is the biggest mystery this year.

300
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Why?

301
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Why did he want to appear in Hei Hei Hei?

302
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
What kind of attitude will he have?

303
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
He said he'd come.

304
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
He wanted to appear from the other side.

305
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
He said he'd come...

306
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
But he didn't say hello.

307
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
He didn't say hello to Nakabuchi.

308
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
This is not Nakabuchi.

309
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
It's not.

310
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Has he ever seen Hei Hei Hei?

311
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I'm sure he has.

312
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
What?

313
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Shoro!

314
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Mr. Shoro!

315
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
No, I'm serious.

316
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I'm sure he has.

317
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Mr. Shoro!

318
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
If you've ever seen him...

319
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I don't know why he wanted to appear in that show.

320
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
What kind of attitude will he have?

321
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
And why will he call us?

322
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Is he wearing glasses?

323
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I'm sure he's wearing glasses.

324
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Is he wearing glasses?

325
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I'm sure he's wearing glasses.

326
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Is he wearing a bandana?

327
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I'm sure he's wearing a bandana.

328
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:44,000
What kind of attitude will he have when Hamada takes him off?

329
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Why did I have to take him off?

330
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Why did I have to take him off?

331
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I don't care.

332
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I don't care about the bandana.

333
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I'll take him off.

334
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Nakabuchi!

335
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
At that time...

336
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
At that time, he would say,

337
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Stop it, Aoi!

338
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I'm going to take him off!

339
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I don't think he would say that.

340
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I don't think he would say that.

341
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
This is my...

342
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Actually, I can't take it off.

343
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
You can't take it off?

344
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I can't take it off.

345
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I see.

346
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I don't know what he's going to do.

347
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
It's really strange.

348
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Is he going to wear a kimono?

349
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Something like this.

350
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
You're going to take it off.

351
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Stop it!

352
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
What are you going to do at that time?

353
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Stop it!

354
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Nakabuchi!

355
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
At that time...

356
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Why does he look like he's driving a car?

357
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Nakabuchi!

358
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
That's what I'm saying.

359
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Stop it, Hamada!

360
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
There's no way.

361
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I really want to see it.

362
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,000
But will they be able to talk while laughing?

363
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
You can laugh, I can laugh,

364
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
This person can laugh,

365
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I can laugh, too.

366
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Can you imagine that?

367
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Nakabuchi is laughing with the three of them.

368
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I don't think so.

369
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
It's okay, it's okay.

370
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
You don't have to worry about it.

371
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Really?

372
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
It's okay, it's okay.

373
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
You don't have to imitate it.

374
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I'm a little worried about that.

375
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
It's okay.

376
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
You don't have to do anything.

377
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Please write it down.

378
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,000
It seems that there is still a big scar on Mr. Matsumoto's back.

379
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Would you like to hear the story of that time?

380
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
It's from Fukushima Prefecture.

381
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Fukushima?

382
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Okino.

383
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Shoji.

384
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Masashi.

385
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Which one?

386
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Well...

387
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
It's a pretty big scar.

388
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
What?

389
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
How big is the scar?

390
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Well...

391
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
From around here...

392
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
It's like this.

393
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Really?

394
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Really.

395
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Why did it happen?

396
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Well...

397
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Well, that's how big the scar is.

398
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Well, it's a beast.

399
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Where did you get that scar?

400
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
When I went camping.

401
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
A beast?

402
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Yes, a beast.

403
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
A beast?

404
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Well, it's a beast that everyone has in mind.

405
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Say it!

406
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Do you understand?

407
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Everyone is waiting.

408
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
A beast?

409
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
What?

410
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
No, no, no.

411
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
It's a mongoose.

412
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I'll say it.

413
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
It's a mongoose.

414
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
It's a mongoose.

415
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
It's pretty big.

416
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I don't care if it's pretty big.

417
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Just step on it.

418
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
What do you think a mongoose is?

419
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
What do you think it is?

420
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I think it's this big.

421
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
If you step on it like this, is it a mongoose?

422
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I think it's this big.

423
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
No, it's about this big.

424
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Really?

425
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Really, really.

426
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
It's as big as a bamboo shoot.

427
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Really, really.

428
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
What's a bamboo shoot?

429
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
This is a mongoose.

430
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
This is a mongoose.

431
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I brought it here when I was camping.

432
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I told him to come to this place.

433
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Then I told him that I was going to die with the owner.

434
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
It's a mongoose.

435
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Why are you talking about a mongoose?

436
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
You can't hurt a mongoose.

437
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
It fell into the book.

438
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Oh, my God.

439
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:48,000
He must have had a lot of desire.

440
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Did you turn your back on him?

441
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Yes.

442
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Then he said,

443
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Oh, my God.

444
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
He said,

445
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Oh, my God.

446
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
So this is not a bad wound.

447
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Rather, as my technician...

448
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
As a technician...

449
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Don't say that.

450
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
As a technician...

451
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
That's enough.

452
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
That's enough.

453
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
That's enough.

454
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:22,000
He knew well.

455
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
He knew well about Okinoko in Fukushima.

456
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
He had a wound in his back.

457
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000
That's why he went with him.

458
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:37,000
This is a question for Mr. Matsumoto, who taught Yoshida how to wear a G-PAN T-shirt.

459
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:42,000
How do you throw away a Heinz T-shirt?

460
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:48,000
This is a great question.

461
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
It's like catching a spider.

462
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Why did you ask me that?

463
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I'll ask you.

464
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
For example, socks.

465
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
When do you throw them away?

466
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Well, if there are a lot of holes, I throw them away.

467
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Do you throw them away that much?

468
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
There are times when they become thin, right?

469
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Yes, there are.

470
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I want to see how far my legs can be seen.

471
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Like a pot?

472
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
How far are they in?

473
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I want to know the amount of my legs.

474
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Well, it's not that bad.

475
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Actually, there was a woman I broke up with.

476
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
She was a pretty good woman.

477
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:36,000
One day, when I came to her house, I saw that her heels were in America.

478
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
That's not good.

479
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I was like, that's not good.

480
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
That's not good.

481
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I broke up with her.

482
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
There are times like that.

483
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I don't break down easily.

484
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I usually wear this kind of rubber.

485
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
It becomes flimsy.

486
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
There are times when it becomes really flimsy.

487
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
There are.

488
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
There are, right?

489
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
There are times when it becomes really flimsy.

490
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:02,000
When I'm running, it becomes really flimsy.

491
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
What kind of shoes do you have?

492
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
There are times when it becomes really flimsy.

493
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
There are times when it becomes really flimsy.

494
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I can't help but laugh.

495
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I can't help but laugh.

496
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I'm not a bad person.

497
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
That's not good.

498
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
When it becomes flimsy, it's definitely not good.

499
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I think it's the same with T-shirts.

500
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
What about your underwear?

501
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I can't look at my underwear from here.

502
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
What are you talking about?

503
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I'm talking about the briefs.

504
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Where should I look at from?

505
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I can't have briefs like this.

506
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I can't have briefs like this.

507
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I'm always like this,

508
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Even though I'm walking in the summer, I can't look at my underwear.

509
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I can't have briefs like this.

510
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Even though I'm walking in the summer, I can't look at my underwear.

511
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
When it's a pair of pants,

512
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
it looks like I'm sitting.

513
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
That's love, though.

514
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Wasn't it like that with old men in the past?

515
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
It's becoming more and more like a short-sleeved shirt.

516
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
The briefs.

517
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
My superior was like that too, the other day.

518
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
What the hell are you doing?

519
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
You're a pervert!

520
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Change your clothes! Change your clothes!

521
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
What the hell are you doing?

522
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Don't take it off until it's like this!

523
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
It's there.

524
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
It's there, right?

525
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
It's there.

526
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I think I should throw it away.

527
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
But I think I should throw it away.

528
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
But if it goes through my brain, I can do something about it.

529
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
That's right!

530
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
That's right. I think I should throw it away.

531
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Put it in the washing machine!

532
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Put it in the washing machine!

533
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
That's right!

534
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
That's right!

535
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Why did you throw it away again?

536
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
I think I should throw it away again.

537
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Why did you throw it away again?

538
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Why did you throw it away again?

539
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
This is a question for you, Mr. Masaboshi, who was studying with Farvel, lining up your desk.

540
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Now there are mysterious mass-produced poisonous spiders in Osaka.

541
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Please tell us a good strategy to defeat them.

542
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Poisonous spiders, right?

543
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Yes.

544
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,000
The ones that are being discovered in Osaka right now, are they the ones with a bad attitude among the spiders?

545
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
They have a bad attitude.

546
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
What?

547
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Their personalities are bad.

548
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
I'd like to hear about their personalities.

549
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
The personalities of poisonous spiders are bad.

550
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
What kind?

551
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Their personalities are really bad.

552
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Is that so?

553
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Yes.

554
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Please tell us about that.

555
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
For example, in a marathon, they say,

556
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Let's run together until the end.

557
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
They go on and on and on.

558
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:48,000
On the day of the exam, they're studying a lot.

559
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
They're studying hard.

560
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
They're studying hard.

561
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Yes, yes.

562
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
There are those kinds of poisonous spiders.

563
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
There are those kinds of poisonous spiders?

564
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Yes.

565
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
They're poisonous spiders, so if there's no exam, they won't run a marathon.

566
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
That's not true.

567
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
But there are those kinds of poisonous spiders.

568
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Why can't you say something like that?

569
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
I can laugh as much as I want.

570
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:17,000
If you don't tell me what I can say, I won't understand.

571
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,000
For example, if you don't tell me what I did.

572
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I see.

573
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Sometimes, you know, you borrow a video rental.

574
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,000
There's a manner to rewind it.

575
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
There are people who rewind it.

576
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Yes, there are.

577
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Yes, there are.

578
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
That's why.

579
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
I know that.

580
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
That's the kind of guy.

581
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
What did that guy do?

582
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
It's a poisonous spider, so a rental video is not enough.

583
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
It's not enough.

584
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
I know that.

585
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
For example, you have a bicycle, right?

586
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
The key to the bicycle.

587
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:03,000
There's a way to figure out how to steal a bicycle.

588
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
You take it to the police station.

589
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
It's parked in front of the station.

590
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
They say you lost the key.

591
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Then you ask the police officer to open it.

592
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
There's no legal way to do that.

593
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
But the police officer says you lost the key, so you open it.

594
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
You open it.

595
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
That's the kind of guy.

596
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
I know that.

597
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I've heard that so many times.

598
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
It's a strategy.

599
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,000
It has nothing to do with me.

600
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
You have a bad personality.

601
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
I just said that.

602
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
It's a lie.

603
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
It's a lie.

604
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
It's a prank.

605
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
It has nothing to do with me.

606
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
It's a lie.

607
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
I was surprised.

608
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
I was deceived.

609
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
I was surprised.

610
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
It's a prank.

611
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
I was surprised.

612
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
It's a prank.

613
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
I'm glad it's a prank.

614
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
It's a prank.

615
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:25,000
It's a prank.
