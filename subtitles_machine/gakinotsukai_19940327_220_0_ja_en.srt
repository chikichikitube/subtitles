1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Seijo Gakuen

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,000
A luxury residential area where famous people such as Seikai, Zaikai, and sportsmen set up a luxurious house.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:16,000
In particular, in the entertainment world, the houses of the residents, including Mr. Ishihara Yujiro, who is now crying, are lined up.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Today, the downtown was guided by a guide and I came to visit the mansion, but I couldn't get in.

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
So I visited the mansion of this person.

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Everyone, this is Mr. Yuzo Kayama's house.

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
It's strong, isn't it?

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Let's go in.

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Actually, you can go in here.

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
You can go in here.

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Wait a minute.

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Camera.

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Oh, it's you.

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I've been found out.

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm doing ping pong.

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
No.

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I can't go in here, so I can't do ping pong.

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Stop it.

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Are you serious?

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Stop it.

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
You can't go in here.

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I can't go in here.

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
It's Mr. Kayama.

24
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I said, can.

25
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I said, can.

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Mr. Kayama doesn't say, can.

27
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
You can't go in here.

28
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Let's go.

29
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
The entrance is big.

30
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Excuse me.

31
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Hello.

32
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Excuse me.

33
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Hello.

34
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Welcome.

35
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Mr. Kayama's house is great.

36
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
No, it's not.

37
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Excuse me.

38
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I'm sorry for the sudden invitation.

39
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
It's okay.

40
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Hey.

41
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Why are you calling your wife?

42
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Do you know that?

43
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I know.

44
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I didn't notice it myself.

45
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
You're athletic.

46
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
That's not true.

47
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Hey.

48
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Coming.

49
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Welcome.

50
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Why are you so surprised?

51
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
No.

52
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:07,000
You're surprised to see your wife.

53
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Excuse me.

54
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
We're open.

55
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
My wife is always like this.

56
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Your beauty hasn't changed.

57
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
You two are...

58
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I'm happy.

59
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I'm sorry.

60
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
It's okay.

61
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Oh, right.

62
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Why don't you take off your clothes?

63
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
It's okay.

64
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Don't be shy.

65
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
No.

66
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
There's food on the second floor.

67
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Come with me.

68
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Don't be shy.

69
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Excuse me.

70
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Thank you for the food.

71
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:57,000
It's delicious.

72
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Excuse me.

73
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
We have to go to work.

74
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Excuse me.

75
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Take this.

76
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Oh, right.

77
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Take this.

78
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
What?

79
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Can I?

80
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Let's go.

81
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I'll take it.

82
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Excuse me.

83
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Thank you.

84
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Excuse me.

85
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Hello.

86
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Hello.

87
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Thank you.

88
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Thank you.

89
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
It's amazing.

90
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
We ate a lot.

91
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
We ate a lot.

92
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
You helped us a lot.

93
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
And you gave me a gift like this.

94
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
You should have brought more.

95
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I didn't think you'd come.

96
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I took care of you.

97
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I took care of you.

98
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I'm glad you came.

99
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I'm glad you came.

100
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
It was worth it.

101
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
You're the best.

102
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Let's go home.

103
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Ladies and gentlemen.

104
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I heard that today's guest is very heavy.

105
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Really?

106
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
You're laughing a lot.

107
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
No, no, no.

108
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I'm laughing a lot.

109
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
No, no, no.

110
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Yamazaki-kun said last time that he couldn't take it at all.

111
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
He said today's guest is heavy.

112
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
No, no, no.

113
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I'm laughing a lot.

114
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Huh?

115
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
You can't take it, can you?

116
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I can't take it.

117
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
No, no, no.

118
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
But you're amazing.

119
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
It's good.

120
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I'm the boss of the bus over there.

121
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
What?

122
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Are you going to make it popular again?

123
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
It's a little bit.

124
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Why?

125
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
What's popular?

126
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I've seen that kind of magazine.

127
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
That stupid thing is popular.

128
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Like the old man from Bulldozer.

129
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
What's that?

130
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Cat.

131
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Is that called a cat?

132
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
That's popular.

133
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I saw that magazine.

134
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
That's popular.

135
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
That's totally popular.

136
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
It's a coincidence.

137
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
It's good.

138
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
What's good?

139
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,000
You're like a young man's brother.

140
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
You're a leader who pulls young people.

141
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
What are you talking about?

142
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
No one says that.

143
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
What are you talking about?

144
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I'm not.

145
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I'm not.

146
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I'm not aiming for that.

147
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
What's that?

148
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
What's that?

149
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
You're a wild man.

150
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I don't watch your drama.

151
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I heard rumors that you make people cry.

152
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
That's good.

153
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Why do you say that?

154
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
That's what you're going to do.

155
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
No, no, no.

156
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I heard you're making people cry.

157
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I don't know.

158
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I'm doing my best.

159
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
No, no, no.

160
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
No, no, no.

161
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
You have to do it properly.

162
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
You made me cry.

163
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Who made you cry?

164
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,000
You made me cry for 24 hours.

165
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I'm going to cry for a long time.

166
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I'm going to cry for 24 hours.

167
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
You don't calculate, do you?

168
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
You say this, you say that.

169
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
My popularity is here.

170
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I'm doing my best.

171
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Who said that?

172
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
This guy and Megumi calculated a lot.

173
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Wait.

174
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Megumi didn't calculate.

175
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Did you see Megumi recently?

176
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
She dyed her hair.

177
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
What's wrong with her?

178
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
She's being selfish.

179
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
First of all, she lost weight.

180
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
She lost a lot of weight.

181
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
That's right.

182
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Why did she become like that?

183
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:13,000
It's her fault.

184
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I can't talk to you.

185
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
No, no, no.

186
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
You're wearing a tie.

187
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I was going to close it.

188
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
But I thought about the microphone.

189
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
It's a microphone that can't be closed.

190
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I was going to close it from the beginning.

191
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
That's why I'm wearing it here.

192
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
It's cool.

193
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
That's how it is these days.

194
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
No, no, no.

195
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
These days, the tie is here.

196
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I think it's going to be popular.

197
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
When you do it, you put it in here.

198
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:48,000
That's not popular at all.

199
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Who's popular?

200
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I've been wearing a tie for a long time.

201
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Who's the only one who wears a tie here?

202
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I still can't break it.

203
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I'll tell you the truth.

204
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:10,000
How long are you going to wear a tie like that?

205
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I'll tell you the truth.

206
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
It's your fault.

207
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Wait, wait, wait.

208
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Have you ever seen me make it like this?

209
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
That's right.

210
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
That's right.

211
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
This is how you make it.

212
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
You can't buy it at all.

213
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
No, my hair quality is impossible.

214
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I can't do that.

215
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
No, no, no.

216
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
You have to try it.

217
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I can't do it.

218
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I can't do it.

219
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
You didn't set it up today.

220
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
That's why it's messed up.

221
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
It hurts, it hurts, it hurts.

222
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Put it down.

223
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
It hurts, it hurts, it hurts.

224
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
It hurts because I'm wearing a tie.

225
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
You're a Tetsuro Kanba.

226
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Don't be so hard on my hair.

227
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Why don't you try it?

228
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I had my hair tied up yesterday.

229
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I don't care about that.

230
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I don't care about that.

231
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I don't care about that.

232
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
What?

233
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I woke up a little early today.

234
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I got my passport.

235
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Passport.

236
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I don't care.

237
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I don't care.

238
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I'm going to New York to record at the end of this month.

239
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Thank you.

240
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Don't be so hard on me.

241
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I've already decided on the costume.

242
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
That's tough.

243
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I'm going to tell you now.

244
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Why?

245
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
What are you going to do?

246
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
How do you spend your time on the plane?

247
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
There's something to talk about.

248
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
What?

249
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:12,000
With the person next to you?

250
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Is that what Ju-san is doing?

251
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
People who talk talk.

252
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Do you know why you're on the plane?

253
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
You don't even know that.

254
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
You can't get on.

255
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:30,000
When the plane falls, it falls from above.

256
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
What's that?

257
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
What do you mean?

258
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Don't ask me if you know.

259
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
You've done this far.

260
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
When the plane falls, it falls from above.

261
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
What's that?

262
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
If I tell you, you'll make fun of me.

263
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
It falls from above.

264
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
What's that?

265
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,000
You know.

266
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
When the plane falls, it falls from above.

267
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Oh, that.

268
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Put it here.

269
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Oxygen bomb.

270
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Oxygen is sent here.

271
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
What?

272
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Oxygen is sent here.

273
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
What do you call that?

274
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Oxygen bomb.

275
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Oxygen bomb.

276
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Bomb.

277
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Bomb.

278
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
It's not a bomb.

279
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Bomb.

280
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Bomb.

281
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
It's not a bomb.

282
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
That oxygen bomb.

283
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
It's a bomb.

284
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Put it here.

285
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I want to be saved.

286
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I want to be saved.

287
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I want to be saved.

288
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I want to be saved.

289
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
That's strange.

290
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
What?

291
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
That oxygen bomb is completely falling.

292
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
That's strange.

293
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
The oxygen bomb isn't falling.

294
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
It's falling.

295
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
It's not just you.

296
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
The oxygen bomb is falling.

297
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Everyone is falling.

298
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Everything is falling.

299
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
What are you relying on?

300
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I don't know.

301
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I don't know.

302
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Safety belt.

303
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Safety belt?

304
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
When did it fall?

305
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
It's always falling.

306
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
That's strange.

307
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,000
It's always falling.

308
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
It's always falling.

309
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I don't understand.

310
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
It's always falling.

311
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I don't understand.

312
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
You understand.

313
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
You understand.

314
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:37,000
It's always falling.

315
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I can't say it's always falling.

316
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I don't understand.

317
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
It's always falling.

318
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
The air is completely empty.

319
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
But we also do this.

320
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I put my knees here like this.

321
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
What's that?

322
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
What?

323
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Does anyone do that?

324
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
How did I explain it to you?

325
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Is that the Thai airport?

326
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Why did you do that to me?

327
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Tell me!

328
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Thai guys are scary.

329
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
You have to do this right away.

330
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
My teeth are getting swollen.

331
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
It's scary.

332
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I'm scared.

333
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
But it can't be helped.

334
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,000
If I'm going to die anyway, I want to die with the person I love.

335
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
What are you talking about?

336
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Because you're so uncool!

337
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
You said you were going to record in America,

338
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
and you were going to go to Geisha Girls,

339
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
and then you fell off the plane and died.

340
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I didn't know that at all.

341
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I didn't know that at all.

342
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
You said a lot of funny things to the old man at the bar.

343
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
About what would happen if I died.

344
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
You don't trust him anymore?

345
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
He's a soldier, too.

346
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I can't help it.

347
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I can't help it.

348
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I can't help it.

349
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
You're a fool.

350
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
You keep saying that.

351
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
What's going on?

352
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
You don't trust me anymore?

353
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I said that, didn't I?

354
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
You don't trust me anymore?

355
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I don't trust you anymore.

356
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
You're a fool.

357
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Why do you say that to a foreigner?

358
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Well, that's fine.

359
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Again?

360
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I'm just trying to get a hold of you.

361
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I'm just trying to get a hold of you.

362
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I think it's pretty popular.

363
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
He's scared.

364
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
What are you going to do with your shoulder?

365
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
What are you going to do with your shoulder?

366
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Turn it!

367
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
What are you going to do with your arm?

368
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
What about your right hand?

369
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
You're sitting down.

370
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
What are you going to do?

371
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,000
You're lying down.

372
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Why are you lying down?

373
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Let me hear it.

374
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Let me hear it.

375
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Let me hear it.

376
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
What do you think?

377
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
What do you think?

378
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
What do you think?

379
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
What do you think?

380
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
What do you think?

381
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Say something.

382
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I'm Aoi. I'm 17 years old.

383
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I'm 17 years old.

384
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I'm 17 years old.

385
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
This is a hot topic.

386
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
This finger.

387
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Really?

388
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Really?

389
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Really?

390
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Really?

391
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Really?

392
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Really?

393
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Really?

394
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Really?

395
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Really?

396
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Really?

397
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I'm an intercept.

398
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,000
That's what happens during a match.

399
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
And you're an intercept.

400
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Intercept is not a position.

401
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
It's not a position.

402
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
What's your name?

403
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Eri Sato.

404
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Are you a singer?

405
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I'm going to be a singer.

406
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
You're going to be a singer?

407
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
You're going to be a singer?

408
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
You're going to be a singer?

409
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Thank you very much.

410
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I have a question for both of you.

411
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Why do you look at your watch?

412
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I don't know.

413
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Watch?

414
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Please look at your watch.

415
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
What time is it now?

416
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Why do you look at your watch like that?

417
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I look like that.

418
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
But you look like that.

419
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
It's not that. It's a gesture.

420
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
It's a gesture.

421
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
It's a gesture.

422
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Look at your hair.

423
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
You're so mean.

424
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
You're a gesture.

425
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
It's you.

426
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
What time is it now?

427
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Can you ask him?

428
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
What time is it now?

429
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Where are you looking at?

430
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Where?

431
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
You're looking here.

432
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Your eyes are not the same.

433
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
No, that's not it!

434
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Ask him!

435
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
What time is it now?

436
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
What are you doing?

437
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
He's not here, right?

438
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
No, he's not here!

439
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
He's not here, right?

440
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
What are you doing?

441
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
What are you doing?

442
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
He's not here, right?

443
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
So, why is that?

444
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
No, no, no, that's because...

445
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Look at the clock.

446
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Right?

447
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Look at the clock.

448
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Oh no, it's the same.

449
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
It's the same?

450
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,000
No, no, no, that's not it.

451
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
You can't do it like this.

452
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
You can't even look at the clock like this.

453
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
You can't even look at the clock like this.

454
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
That's because you know it.

455
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
You can't do it like this, so you do it like this.

456
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Why is he angry?

457
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Why is he angry?

458
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Why is he angry?

459
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Bite me.

460
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Who's going to bite me?

461
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
The face on the spoon looks like it's upside down.

462
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Is this someone's trick?

463
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:54,000
The mirror doesn't look like that.

464
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
The mirror doesn't look like that.

465
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Why?

466
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,000
You should think about that.

467
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
That's not it.

468
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Today, your postcard...

469
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
You didn't answer at all at the end.

470
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
What?

471
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
You only listened to people and didn't talk at all.

472
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
In your postcard.

473
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Oh no.

474
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
No, no, no.

475
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
You didn't talk at all.

476
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I don't like it.

477
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
I don't like it.

478
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
I didn't ask you why you didn't drink it.

479
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Don't lick the spoon.

480
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
To put it simply, don't lick the spoon.

481
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
It's really easy to say now, so I think it's hard to understand.

482
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
It's easy to say, but it's hard to understand.

483
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
I just said it randomly.

484
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Don't lick it.

485
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
I understand that you don't lick it, so why did you say it the other way around?

486
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
I really want to hear that now.

487
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Not now.

488
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
You can't hear it unless it's now.

489
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
I want to hear it now.

490
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Let's close our eyes for a moment.

491
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
No, no, no. You should talk.

492
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Then, let's stand up for a moment.

493
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
No, no, no.

494
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
You don't have to stand up.

495
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
I'm calm now.

496
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
You should talk.

497
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Spoon.

498
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Spoon is curry.

499
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Wait a minute.

500
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Don't lick the spoon.

501
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
You didn't say it at all.

502
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
You should have said it from the beginning.

503
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Spoon is curry.

504
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Curry is spicy.

505
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Wait a minute.

506
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Who told you to say something like that?

507
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Spicy is kimchi.

508
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Spicy is kimchi.

509
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Right?

510
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Spicy is kimchi.

511
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Kimchi.

512
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Kimchi is pickled.

513
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Yes, yes.

514
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Pickled is upside down.

515
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
And upside down.

516
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Let's go home.

517
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
No, no, no.

518
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:10,000
No, no, no.
