1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Yo man, what's up?

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
How are you all doing in the new year of 1996?

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Tonight is a special night.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Last year, 47 episodes were aired.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Out of which, 13 episodes have exceeded the 20% viewer rating.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Tonight, we'll be showing you the best selection.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Let's send off the 95th Koshitoitsu Festival.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:36,000
This program is brought to you by the following sponsors.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
First, the first challenge against downtown's Itoi Shigesato, Black Bass Fishing.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:50,000
The passionate battle between Reihou Fujino and Kawaguchiko has reached 21% viewer rating.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Will the Black Bass Fishing be able to catch it?

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
This is the opening of the show.

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The first challenge against downtown's Itoi Shigesato, Black Bass Fishing.

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
What is it?

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Itoi is fishing here.

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
That's right.

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I'm sorry I'm so early.

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
You're the one who's early.

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I'm sorry I'm so early.

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Will you be able to catch it here?

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I will.

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Do you see what I just caught?

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Yes, I can see it.

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Can I brag about it?

25
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Yes, go ahead.

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
It's mine.

27
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
It's mine.

28
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
That's the one you just caught, right?

29
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Just now.

30
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Just now?

31
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Just now, just now.

32
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I purposely dropped it, but it's fresh.

33
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:53,000
The battle between downtown's Itoi Shigesato and Black Bass Fishing is about to begin.

34
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Two times a week, Itoi goes to Kawaguchiko and gets to the Black Bass point.

35
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
It's already over.

36
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I'm going to do it.

37
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I'm going to do it.

38
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I can do it.

39
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
It's coming, it's coming.

40
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
It's coming.

41
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Don't be impatient.

42
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
It's coming.

43
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Don't be impatient.

44
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
It's coming.

45
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
His face is completely impatient.

46
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
His face is nervous.

47
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
His face is up.

48
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
He's impatient.

49
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Yes.

50
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Wait.

51
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Okay.

52
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Hey.

53
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Put your thumb in here.

54
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
It's scary.

55
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
It's scary.

56
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
It's okay.

57
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
It's okay.

58
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
It's really scary.

59
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
It's okay.

60
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
How do you get the hook?

61
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Put it in front of the camera.

62
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
This guy is a fool.

63
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
This guy is a fool.

64
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
What are you going to do if you get caught by me?

65
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Look at his eyes.

66
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Itoi is on the screen.

67
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I saw it as 28 cm.

68
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
This is a good size.

69
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Nice, nice.

70
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Mine is better.

71
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
This guy is also a fool.

72
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
What is it?

73
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
You have to take this off, right?

74
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Yes.

75
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I'm happy.

76
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
It's coming.

77
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
It's coming.

78
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Okay.

79
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
It's small.

80
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Why did you put it in both sides?

81
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I forgot to put it in both sides.

82
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
It's a gill again.

83
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
The gill is bothering me.

84
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I'm sorry.

85
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I gave up.

86
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I'm going to be a gill.

87
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Get the one you just dug.

88
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
That's sad.

89
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Get the one you just dug.

90
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
It's the worst if you say it by hitting.

91
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
That's not it.

92
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Did something get caught?

93
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
There is a rope over there.

94
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
It's a gill.

95
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
He is leaning on the string.

96
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
It's the most difficult time to catch from here.

97
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
He has the power to make a difference.

98
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
It's coming.

99
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
It's coming.

100
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
It's coming.

101
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
It's coming.

102
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Wait a minute.

103
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
What?

104
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Is the drag off?

105
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
What?

106
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
What?

107
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Wait a minute.

108
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
It's heavy.

109
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I'm holding it.

110
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I'm holding it.

111
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
It's like a mammoth.

112
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Isn't it a mammoth?

113
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Isn't it a hand?

114
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Wait a minute.

115
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
What is this?

116
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
It's big.

117
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
It's big.

118
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
What is this?

119
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
It's big.

120
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
It's big.

121
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
It's big.

122
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
It's big.

123
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
It's big.

124
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
It's big.

125
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
It's really big.

126
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
It's definitely a gill.

127
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
It's definitely a gill.

128
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Don't let it escape.

129
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Raise the rod.

130
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Raise the rod.

131
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Raise the rod.

132
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
It's big.

133
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
It's big.

134
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
It's big.

135
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
It's big.

136
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
What is this?

137
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Show me.

138
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
This is big.

139
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
This way.

140
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
It's hot.

141
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
It's hot.

142
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
It's big.

143
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
It's 46 cm.

144
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
It's 47 cm.

145
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
It's 47 cm.

146
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
It's amazing.

147
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
It's the biggest fish I've ever caught.

148
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I caught it in the United States.

149
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Is that so?

150
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
We're going quietly.

151
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
It's not a bad thing.

152
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
This is a good size.

153
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
It's coming.

154
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
All right.

155
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
It's big.

156
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
It's big.

157
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
But it's not bigger than the other one.

158
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
It's not as big as the other.

159
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
It's small.

160
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
This is big.

161
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
It's big.

162
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:05,000
You can catch as many as you want!

163
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
What is this?

164
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
It's wrinkled.

165
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
It's big.

166
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
It's coming again.

167
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Wait a minute.

168
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
This is big.

169
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Wait a minute.

170
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Can I wind it up?

171
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Wait a minute.

172
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
It's wrinkled.

173
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Did I hold it?

174
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I'll wind it up.

175
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
It's big.

176
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I did it!

177
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Stop it.

178
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I'm sorry.

179
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
It's coming.

180
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
It's coming.

181
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
It's coming.

182
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
It's big.

183
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
It's big.

184
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Don't rush it.

185
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I changed my way of thinking when I was with you two.

186
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Didn't you see it?

187
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
No.

188
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
It's big to some extent.

189
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I lost my motivation to fish.

190
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Why?

191
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Why?

192
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Why?

193
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
It's big to some extent.

194
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
It's big to some extent.

195
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
It's big.

196
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
It's coming.

197
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
What is it?

198
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
It's coming closer.

199
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Next, Yamazaki, who is grateful to downtown for his daily help, prepares to fish in Yagatabune.

200
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:29,000
The highest viewing rate in 1995 was 23.4% in downtown, where he forgets about me and plays with geisha.

201
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Yes.

202
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Please enjoy it today.

203
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Gaki no Tsukai Settai Kikaku.

204
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Playing geisha in Yagatabune.

205
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
This is good.

206
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Good, isn't it?

207
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I prepared all the food in Edo.

208
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
All the food in Edo?

209
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I prepared all the food in front of Edo.

210
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Thank you very much.

211
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
But you don't laugh much, do you?

212
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
That's right.

213
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Yes.

214
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Is it funny?

215
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Yamazaki Settai doesn't laugh.

216
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
No, it's okay.

217
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Wait a minute.

218
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Look at this.

219
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
The baseball is also very beautiful.

220
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I'll take a picture of it.

221
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
It's easy to catch.

222
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
It's easy to catch.

223
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Yamazaki Settai Kikaku.

224
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Playing geisha in Yagatabune.

225
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
We've arrived at the point.

226
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Here?

227
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Yes.

228
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
It's just around the corner.

229
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
This way.

230
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
This way.

231
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Why do you hide it?

232
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Don't hide it.

233
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I'm sorry.

234
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
That's right.

235
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Let's go.

236
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Let's go.

237
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Have fun today.

238
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
It doesn't matter which one.

239
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
It doesn't matter which one.

240
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
A girl.

241
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I love you.

242
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Excuse me.

243
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Yamazaki Settai Kikaku.

244
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Playing geisha in Yagatabune.

245
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Yamazaki Settai Kikaku.

246
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Playing geisha in Yagatabune.

247
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
It's funny.

248
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I'll take a picture of it and let you practice it.

249
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Why are you all bending your back?

250
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Yamazaki Settai Kikaku.

251
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Playing geisha in Yagatabune.

252
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Who is that lady with glasses?

253
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
She looks like an educator.

254
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
She is an educator.

255
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Really?

256
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Yes.

257
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:57,000
From now on, I will show you the performance of Mameyakko, who has been a geisha for a long time in Edo.

258
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
She has a geisha.

259
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I will show you the performance of Jin no Shachiro.

260
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
That's good.

261
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Are you sick?

262
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Ganbare! Ganbare!

263
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Yoi!

264
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Yoi!

265
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
What are you doing?

266
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
What are you doing?

267
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Don't be angry.

268
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Mameyakko is crazy.

269
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Don't be crazy.

270
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Excuse me.

271
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Excuse me.

272
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Excuse me.

273
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
What are you doing?

274
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Are you serious?

275
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Are you serious?

276
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I'm scared.

277
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
What are you doing?

278
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
What are you doing?

279
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
What are you doing?

280
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I'm very scared.

281
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I'm scared.

282
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
You look like a geisha.

283
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
You look like a geisha.

284
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Is this your sister?

285
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Yes, she is my sister.

286
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
She is a geisha.

287
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
She is a geisha.

288
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
She is a geisha.

289
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I will show you the real Shachiro.

290
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
That's good.

291
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I will show you the real Shachiro.

292
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Thank you.

293
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Thank you.

294
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I came here to show you.

295
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I came here to show you.

296
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I came here to show you.

297
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I came here to show you.

298
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I came here to show you.

299
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I will show you the real Shachiro.

300
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Look at this.

301
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
It's so sad.

302
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
What are you doing?

303
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Brother!

304
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Nippon Ichi!

305
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Brother!

306
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Nippon Ichi!

307
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
It's not a big deal.

308
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Nippon Ichi!

309
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Nippon Ichi!

310
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
What are you looking at?

311
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
It's not a big deal.

312
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
It's not a big deal.

313
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Oh, he's gone somewhere.

314
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:44,000
It's not a big deal.

315
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
In the first episode of Chikishiki!

316
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Matsumoto's Prank!

317
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Big Operation!

318
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
This project marked 21.1%.

319
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
After the shooting,

320
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Matsumoto and his team went on a secret mission.

321
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Matsumoto's true identity was exposed.

322
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Thank you for your hard work.

323
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Thank you for your hard work.

324
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Thank you for your hard work.

325
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Thank you for your hard work.

326
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Thank you for your hard work.

327
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
We're back.

328
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
We're going on a secret mission.

329
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Let's go.

330
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Don't get caught.

331
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Don't get caught.

332
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Don't get caught.

333
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Don't get caught.

334
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Don't get caught.

335
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Don't get caught.

336
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Don't get caught.

337
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
What?

338
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
What is it?

339
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
What is it?

340
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
That's it.

341
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
That's it.

342
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
It's amazing.

343
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I've never seen anything like this before.

344
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I've never seen anything like this before.

345
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,940
This popsicle is so big and delicious

346
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,640
Tender cut ta me

347
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:17,100
The flavors are so good

348
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:25,060
This is my first time to eat this aimu

349
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:27,060
Let's go get some sake.

350
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:29,060
Let's go, let's go.

351
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:33,060
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

352
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:35,060
Let's go.

353
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:38,060
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

354
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:48,060
What the hell?

355
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:14,060
I'm going to check on him.

356
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:18,060
What the hell?

357
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:21,060
He's training his body in a place like this?

358
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:23,060
Let's stop.

359
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:24,060
What?

360
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:25,060
It's the first time.

361
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:27,060
It's not like that.

362
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:31,060
You can see it at the sports club.

363
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:34,060
I think the sports club was here.

364
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:39,060
It's free.

365
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:49,060
Why is he eating bread in a place like this?

366
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:53,060
It's a parking lot.

367
00:15:53,060 --> 00:16:03,060
He's so talented.

368
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:06,060
He went in here.

369
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:08,060
Let's stop.

370
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:09,060
Let's go.

371
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:13,060
He went in here.

372
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:16,060
What's going on?

373
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:18,060
There's something here.

374
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,060
What?

375
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:21,060
Is it a private apartment?

376
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:23,060
What are you talking about?

377
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:24,060
That's right.

378
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:28,060
He rented a room here.

379
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:29,060
I don't know anything about it.

380
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:30,060
I don't know anything about it.

381
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:36,060
Who is it?

382
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:38,060
Who is it?

383
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:39,060
Who is it?

384
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:40,060
It's a different room.

385
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:43,060
Is it an old lady?

386
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:44,060
Is it an old lady?

387
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:46,060
I don't know.

388
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:47,060
What's going on?

389
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:52,060
What's going on?

390
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:53,060
What's going on?

391
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:56,060
What's going on?

392
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:58,060
There's a lot of people here.

393
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:00,060
He's shaking his shoulders.

394
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:02,060
There's a lot of people here.

395
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:07,060
What's going on?

396
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:14,060
All of a sudden?

397
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:20,060
I can't imagine what's going on.

398
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:23,060
It's hard.

399
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:28,060
I'm sure he's going to put a mosaic on his wife's face.

400
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:30,060
Is that the only way?

401
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:35,060
That's the only thing we can do.

402
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:37,060
That's the only thing we can do.

403
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:40,060
Two weeks later,

404
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:42,060
Oomomichi was full of anger and sadness.

405
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:43,060
Matsumoto was in the back.

406
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:46,060
What's the shocking event he confessed to?

407
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:47,060
Thank you.

408
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:48,060
Thank you.

409
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:49,060
Thank you.

410
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:50,060
Thank you.

411
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:51,060
Thank you.

412
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:52,060
Thank you.

413
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:53,060
Thank you.

414
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:54,060
Thank you.

415
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:02,060
We broke up.

416
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:06,060
We broke up.

417
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:09,060
This project, which had a viewer rating of 20.4%,

418
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:12,060
was initiated by Matsumoto, who was burning with revenge.

419
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:16,060
Did he shake your hand?

420
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:18,060
He shook Shinmi's hand.

421
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:21,060
When he said he didn't like it, he said he wanted to put a mosaic on his wife's face.

422
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:23,060
He wanted to put a mosaic on his wife's face.

423
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:25,060
He wanted to take a phone call from his family.

424
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:31,060
He didn't want me to be the only one who was like this.

425
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:34,060
I'm going to do it today.

426
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:36,060
An emergency project.

427
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:38,060
Masatoshi Hamada's great plan for the future.

428
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:40,060
The continuation will be after the commercial.

429
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:45,060
After the recording of Gaki no Tsukai, the revenge was finally settled.

430
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:50,060
Thank you for your hard work.

431
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:51,060
Thank you for your hard work.

432
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:52,060
Thank you for your hard work.

433
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:58,060
Let's go.

434
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:02,060
We can't be separated.

435
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:03,060
Let's go.

436
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:05,060
Are you alone?

437
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,060
What?

438
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:07,060
Are you alone?

439
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:08,060
Yes, I'm alone.

440
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:10,060
I don't know unless I see you.

441
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:11,060
Let's go.

442
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:12,060
Let's go.

443
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:13,060
Let's go.

444
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:14,060
Let's go.

445
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:15,060
Let's go.

446
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:25,060
Why is it raining?

447
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:27,060
It's raining.

448
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:28,060
What?

449
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:29,060
It's raining.

450
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:30,060
It's raining.

451
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:32,060
He's walking.

452
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:33,060
He's walking.

453
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:34,060
Look at him.

454
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:35,060
He's walking.

455
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:37,060
He's walking like a fool.

456
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:38,060
He's walking like a fool.

457
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:40,060
He's not thinking about anything.

458
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:41,060
Is it okay?

459
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:42,060
Look.

460
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:44,060
He's walking.

461
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:45,060
He's walking.

462
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:46,060
He's walking.

463
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:47,060
He's walking.

464
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,060
He's walking.

465
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:49,060
What?

466
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:50,060
What?

467
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:52,060
What?

468
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:53,060
Do you want to do it?

469
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:54,060
What?

470
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:57,060
The best soap land.

471
00:19:58,060 --> 00:19:59,060
Suyahime.

472
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:00,060
Suyahime.

473
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:01,060
Soap?

474
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:04,060
Do you want to go to the soap?

475
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:06,060
I can't go to the soap.

476
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:08,060
You'll be in the scene.

477
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:12,060
So you've been talking.

478
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:14,060
You don't even want to go to the soap.

479
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:16,060
Refreshing.

480
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:17,060
This is a joke.

481
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:19,060
You should really look at this.

482
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:22,060
It's really good.

483
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:24,060
It's really good.

484
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:25,060
What is this?

485
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:26,060
This is good.

486
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,060
This is good.

487
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,060
He's coming out.

488
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:30,060
He's coming out.

489
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:31,060
He's coming out.

490
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:32,060
He's coming out.

491
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:33,060
He's coming out.

492
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:35,060
It's refreshing.

493
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:36,060
Where did he go?

494
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:37,060
Where did he go?

495
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:38,060
What is this?

496
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:39,060
What is this?

497
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:40,060
What is this?

498
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:42,060
The rain is weird.

499
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:44,060
This is a good room.

500
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:48,060
There he is.

501
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:50,060
Jimmy.

502
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:54,060
It's refreshing.

503
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:59,060
This is a good room.

504
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:00,060
Orange juice.

505
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:02,060
Orange juice?

506
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:03,060
Are you crazy?

507
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:04,060
I'm going to the bathroom.

508
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:06,060
I'm going to the bathroom.

509
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:08,060
My throat hurts.

510
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:22,060
There he is.

511
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:30,060
Where did he go?

512
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:31,060
Where did he go?

513
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:38,060
What is this?

514
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:40,060
Isn't that a bathroom?

515
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:42,060
It's a bathroom.

516
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:44,060
Why is it a bathroom?

517
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:46,060
Money is...

518
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:49,060
This is a good room.

519
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:52,060
This is a good room.

520
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:55,060
What is he doing?

521
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:57,060
He's been in Kobayashi and Akira Barrier.

522
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:58,060
He's in again.

523
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:59,060
He's in again.

524
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:04,060
Does the soap taste like soap?

525
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:06,060
And he borrowed money.

526
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:08,060
It says Playmate Academy.

527
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:09,060
There's no academy this time.

528
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:10,060
There's no academy this time.

529
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:11,060
He's young.

530
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:13,060
It's refreshing.

531
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:17,060
What is this?

532
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:19,060
He's been in Kobayashi and Akira Barrier.

533
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:20,060
He's in again.

534
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:21,060
He's in again.

535
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:22,060
He's in again.

536
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:23,060
What is this?

537
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:25,060
What are you thinking?

538
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:29,060
He's in Kobayashi and Akira Barrier.

539
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:30,060
That's right.

540
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:34,060
He's in again.

541
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:35,060
He's in again.

542
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:38,060
Three games.

543
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:39,060
Three games?

544
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:40,060
Let's go.

545
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:42,060
It's refreshing.

546
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:43,060
It's refreshing.

547
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:45,060
There he is.

548
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:46,060
Did he take it?

549
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:47,060
What are you talking about?

550
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:48,060
Let's go.

551
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:49,060
You should have taken it.

552
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:50,060
Stop it.

553
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:51,060
Stop it.

554
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:00,060
Hey!

555
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:01,060
Hey!

556
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:02,060
Hey!

557
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:04,060
What is this?

558
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:05,060
Excuse me.

559
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:06,060
Who are you?

560
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:07,060
Amada?

561
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:08,060
Excuse me.

562
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:10,060
I'm not Amada.

563
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:15,060
What are you doing here?

564
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:17,060
Excuse me.

565
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:18,060
Be careful.

566
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:19,060
Excuse me.

567
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:24,060
Where did you buy it?

568
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:25,060
What?

569
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:27,060
That's strange.

570
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:29,060
Why did you buy it?

571
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:32,060
It was Amada, wasn't it?

572
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:35,060
I told you to stop it.

573
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:37,060
Why?

574
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:38,060
Who is Amada?

575
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:40,060
Where did you buy it?

576
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:44,060
I bought it when I was going home.

577
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:46,060
I see.

578
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:48,060
What?

579
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:52,060
It was different from the store.

580
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:53,060
What?

581
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:54,060
I see.

582
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:02,060

584
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:05,060
It stinks!

585
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:07,060
It's finally going to be released.

586
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:08,060
Darn it!
