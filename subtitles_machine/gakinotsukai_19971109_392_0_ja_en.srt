1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Chikichiki! Hensei Ponpoko Tanuki Neiri Gassai!

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Today we have two teams, the downtown team and the Yamasaki-Kogoriko team.

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Each team chose a tanuki.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Which of the two teams will be able to beat the Tanuki Neiri?

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Who will be the judge?

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
No one.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
No one? But they're all lined up over there.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
The judge is Mr. Kenji Suga.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Nice to meet you.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Who is it?

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
What a strange character.

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Why are you dressed like that?

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
You're all dressed up.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I look like a fake talent.

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Who are you?

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I don't know.

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
This program is brought to you by the following sponsors.

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Let's start with the Tanuki from the east.

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
That's us.

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The Tanuki from the west.

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
The Tanuki from the Yamasaki-Kogoriko team.

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Let's begin!

23
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
This is getting interesting.

24
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I wanted to be a Tanuki too.

25
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
The Tanuki from the west.

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:02:18,000
The Tanuki from the Yamasaki-Kogoriko team.

27
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
You're all dressed up.

28
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
The Tanuki from the west.

29
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Did you drink something?

30
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Who will be able to sleep in the first round of the Tanuki from the west?

31
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
No matter how much you sleep, your body will be strong.

32
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
This is a boxing box.

33
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I'll put this on my belly.

34
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Here I go!

35
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Who are you going to hit?

36
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Wow!

37
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
You said wow!

38
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
But look at this.

39
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I can't get up.

40
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I can't get up at all.

41
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
What about me?

42
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
As you can see, I have a lot of muscles.

43
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
This is a meat bun.

44
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
And this is a shumai.

45
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I can't get up at all.

46
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:25,000
He can't get up at all.

47
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
You were angry when you woke up, weren't you?

48
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
It was itchy.

49
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
When you were sleeping, it was itchy.

50
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
That's right.

51
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
It was just a coincidence.

52
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
It wasn't itchy at all.

53
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
It was itchy twice.

54
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
What is the score of the Yamasaki-Kokoriko team?

55
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
8.9 points, 9.8 points, 8.5 points.

56
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
42 points.

57
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
What is the score of the mountain team?

58
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
10 points, 8 points, 7.9 points, 7.5 points.

59
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
40 points.

60
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
The second round.

61
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Who will be the one to continue?

62
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I have a favorite.

63
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
This is my favorite.

64
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
This is my favorite.

65
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
This is huge.

66
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I don't want to eat it.

67
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
What do you do with this?

68
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I stick this to my body.

69
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I put it in here.

70
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I put it in here.

71
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I can't get up.

72
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I can't get up at all.

73
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I want to put it in from here.

74
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
It's quite rough.

75
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
It's quite rough.

76
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I have a favorite.

77
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I can't get up.

78
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I can't get up at all.

79
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I can't get caught.

80
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I put it in the lid.

81
00:04:47,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I put it in the lid.

82
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I can't get up.

83
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I can't get up.

84
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I can't get up.

85
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I can't get up.

86
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I can't get up.

87
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I can't get up.

88
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Go in.

89
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I can't get up.

90
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I can't get up.

91
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I can't get up.

92
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I can't get up.

93
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I can't get up.

94
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I can't get up.

95
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I can't get up.

96
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
The third one.

97
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Whose head you are lying on?

98
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Who puts his head on it?

99
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
It's important.

100
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
This is huge.

101
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:51,000
It's okay, right? It's okay at all.

102
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
This is amazing.

103
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
This is amazing.

104
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:01,000
What do you mean by doing it right and left?

105
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
What does this mean?

106
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
This is amazing.

107
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
This is amazing.

108
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I understand.

109
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Let's look at the scores.

110
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Yamasaki and Koryuho's team's score is...

111

The third round.

120
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Please close your eyes and sleep.

121
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Please play the music.

122
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Please.

123
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
What?

124
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Please play the music.

125
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Please play the music.

126
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I've never played this before.

127
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
It's creepy.

128
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
It's creepy.

129
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
It's creepy.

130
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
It's creepy.

131
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
It's creepy.

132
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Please make it into an H.

133
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
This is an H.

134
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
It's coming.

135
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
It's an H.

136
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
It's cute.

137
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
It's an H.

138
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
It's an H.

139
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Does it hurt?

140
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I want to act.

141
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Let's take it off.

142
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Teacher.

143
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
There's something like juice coming out of this skull.

144
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Isn't that sweat?

145
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
It's not sweat.

146
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
What is this?

147
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
It's like it's coming up.

148
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I'm amazing.

149
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I'm going to appear from here.

150
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Please.

151
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
What is it?

152
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
It's a new raccoon.

153
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
It's like Mr. Ishimoku.

154
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
What kind of idol is this?

155
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
A new raccoon.

156
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
What are you doing?

157
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
What are you doing without talking?

158
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:50,000
It's amazing.

159
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
He's licking his nose.

160
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Do you know what happens after licking your nose?

161
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
He licks his mouth too.

162
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
It's amazing.

163
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,000
He doesn't talk at all.

164
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
That's it?

165
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
His face is scary.

166
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
He's an amazing character.

167
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
He's amazing.

168
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Fujiwara got 43 points from the water ball attack.

169
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Fujiwara got 47 points.

170
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Next, they will have a match at the same time.

171
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Let's go.

172
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Let's go.

173
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
At the same time.

174
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Yes.

175
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Ignition.

176
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Yes.

177
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Okay.

178
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I have to keep an eye on it.

179
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Let's see how long it takes.

180
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Isn't it hot?

181
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
What?

182
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Isn't it hot?

183
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Do your best, raccoon.

184
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Do your best.

185
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Raccoon.

186
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Why are you talking?

187
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
It's hot.

188
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
That's right.

189
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
You sleep well.

190
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
You sleep well.

191
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I sleep well.

192
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
It's a good season to sleep.

193
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
What?

194
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I'm all right.

195
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I'm all right.

196
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I'll stick to it from now on.

197
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
What are you talking about?

198
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
My raccoon will be from now on.

199
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
What?

200
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,000
What?

201
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
It's a great movement.

202
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
It's a great movement.

203
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
You're good.

204
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Do your best, east.

205
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Do your best, east.

206
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Do your best, east.

207
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Do your best, east.

208
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I'm going to drop it

209
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I did it!

210
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
It's finally the last match

211
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,000
With 55kg of hot water bath, Tanuki's true strength will be revealed

212
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Let's see how he does it

213
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Let's do it

214
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
1,2,3

215
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
It's heavy

216
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Put it in slowly

217
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Gently

218
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
From the legs

219
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Put the squid on the legs

220
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Will it wake up?

221
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
It's okay

222
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
You can do it

223
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Put it in

224
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Why?

225
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
It's already awake

226
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I'm going

227
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I'm counting on you

228
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
You're fast

229
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Why are you doing that?

230
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
1,2,3

231
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Put the squid on the legs

232
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
It's okay

233
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
You're fast

234
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
You're fast

235
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
1,2,3

236
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
He's trying to sleep

237
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
The current record is 2.28 seconds

238
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:38,000
This Tanuki's record is 2.34 seconds

239
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
This is a very interesting sight

240
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I'm very happy

241
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Yesterday

242
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I was boxing in the morning

243
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Did anyone see me?

244
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I was laughing

245
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I couldn't help but laugh

246
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Boxing

247
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
There are many names

248
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Fighting Harada, Guts Ishimatsu

249
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I was surprised by the name

250
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I was surprised by the ring name

251
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Cyborg Koichi

252
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Really?

253
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Really?

254
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
At that time, I became a fan

255
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Cyborg Koichi

256
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
First of all

257
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
The announcer and the commentator

258
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
They call me a cyborg

259
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
But

260
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Now Koichi has a good punch

261
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Koichi doesn't say that

262
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Cyborg moves fast

263
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I'm a cyborg

264
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I forgot the name of the opponent

265
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I have too much impact

266
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,000
You have to stop the movement of the cyborg

267
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I can't stop

268
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I'm a cyborg

269
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I was surprised

270
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
How was the fight?

271
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
It was amazing

272
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I was surprised

273
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Turn around

274
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
In the first round

275
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
The cyborg was amazing

276
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
After the first round

277
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Cyborg won the fight

278
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
In the second round

279
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Cyborg won

280
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I was surprised

281
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
In the third round

282
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Cyborg won

283
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Cyborg

284
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Cyborg

285
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I didn't stand up

286
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I ran out of fuel

287
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
The announcer said

288
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
The cyborg doesn't move

289
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Is that true?

290
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Is that true?

291
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
It's true

292
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
The cyborg doesn't move

293
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
The referee

294
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Of course

295
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
The cyborg

296
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
The cyborg lost

297
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
The cyborg lost

298
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Really?

299
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
The man with the microphone

300
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
He came to the ring

301
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
He explained

302
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I'm a cyborg

303
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I'm a cyborg

304
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I'm a cyborg

305
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
At the end of the second round

306
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
The opponent's left hook

307
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I don't know

308
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
The opponent's left hook

309
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I see

310
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
The cyborg's left hook broke

311
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
How did it happen?

312
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
It doesn't break

313
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
The first round was amazing

314
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
It was amazing

315
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
It was a lie

316
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I thought the lid was open

317
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
The lid was open

318
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
You can open it

319
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
No matter what

320
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I can open it

321
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
It's like the lid under the TV

322
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
It's like

323
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I've done it twice

324
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I thought it was open

325
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I think I can open it

326
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
It's okay

327
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I think it's open

328
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
It's like

329
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
The club president did it

330
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
He did

331
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Seriously

332
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
That's right.

333
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Well then...

334
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Yesterday...

335
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Yes, yes.

336
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Isn't this sashiba?

337
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
You, right?

338
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Yes.

339
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Yesterday...

340
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Don't say it like that.

341
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Suddenly...

342
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
It fell down.

343
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Ah!

344
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Ah, no, no, no!

345
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
No!

346
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
That's no good.

347
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
And then...

348
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Oh!

349
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
That's no good!

350
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
That's no good!

351
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
That's no good, right?

352
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I'm glad it didn't happen today.

353
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
It's the last time!

354
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I can't even open my eyes.

355
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
What were you doing?

356
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I wasn't doing anything.

357
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Yesterday, I was talking to the staff.

358
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
That's right.

359
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I thought something was stuck in my bone.

360
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
After I ate the sashiba.

361
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I thought something was stuck in my bone.

362
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
And then I dropped it.

363
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I looked at it.

364
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I looked at it.

365
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
No one noticed.

366
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I noticed.

367
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Everyone knows that you dropped your tooth.

368
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Everyone knows that you dropped your tooth.

369
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Everyone knows that you dropped your tooth.

370
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I said something.

371
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I looked at it.

372
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
No one noticed.

373
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I probably didn't put my face on it.

374
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
No one noticed.

375
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
But the staff also noticed.

376
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
You put your face on it and did this.

377
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
There's a place like this, too.

378
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Hama-chan...

379
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
There's a place where she gets shy.

380
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
She says that.

381
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
She says that on the phone.

382
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Why?

383
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Shazuna.

384
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Every Little Thing.

385
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Matsumoto-san is the parent of a recently popular band.

386
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
That's right.

387
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Actually, she's about to change her name to Downtown.

388
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
That's right.

389
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I can say that.

390
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Matsumoto-san, please tell us your current favorite name.

391
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
And why did you come up with that name?

392
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Please tell us the reason.

393
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Did you come up with the name Shazuna?

394
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I came up with it.

395
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Why Shazuna?

396
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
It doesn't matter what it feels like.

397
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
It doesn't matter what it feels like.

398
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:02,000
It feels like it has a lot of vitamins in it.

399
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
What kind of world has a name like that?

400
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
So you're going to change your name to Downtown.

401
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Downtown is...

402
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I'm starting to get bored of it.

403
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I'm starting to get bored of it.

404
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Even if people call me Downtown, I don't feel like looking back.

405
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
That's your personal feeling, isn't it?

406
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
In that sense, my favorite name right now is...

407
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Attention, please.

408
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
You have to think about a lot of things when you put on a band.

409
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
When you get called by the staff.

410
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
There are a lot of things.

411
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Attention, please.

412
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
It's kind of...

413
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
It's kind of...

414
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
It's kind of...

415
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I can say, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

416
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I think it's better to have a name.

417
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
That way, you'll remember it.

418
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Yes, yes.

419
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
I'll remember it.

420
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,000
For example, when everyone goes on a trip to America or overseas,

421
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
You'll definitely hear the name Downtown.

422
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Even for a moment, the name Downtown will pop up in your head.

423
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
It's the same thing.

424
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
When everyone gets on a plane,

425
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
They'll say, attention, please.

426
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
My and Hamada's faces will pop up.

427
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
That alone is worth it.

428
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Next month, or the month after that,

429
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,000
I think it will gradually be reflected in that direction.

430
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Mr. Matsumoto, who was once the judge of the Supreme Court,

431
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Mr. Matsumoto, who was once the judge of the Supreme Court,

432
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
What is the boundary between rape and not rape?

433
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Rape, right?

434
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I'll tell you this, because you're all stupid.

435
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
I'll tell you in a way that's easy to understand.

436
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Why?

437
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
It's okay to say it normally.

438
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
It's easier to understand that way.

439
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
It's easy to understand, right?

440
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
For example.

441
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Crying out of courtesy.

442
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Crying out of courtesy, right?

443
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,000
A girl I don't like.

444
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
A girl I don't like!

445
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Say it with confidence at the beginning.

446
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Crying out of courtesy!

447
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Crying out of courtesy!

448
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I'm sorry.

449
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
I'm really sorry about that.

450
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Go home!

451
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
I'm sorry.

452
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Rape.

453
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Rape!

454
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I've reached the letter E.

455
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Here I go.

456
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Crying out of courtesy!

457
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Crying out of courtesy?

458
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
You should have said it yourself.

459
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Crying out of courtesy!

460
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Crying out of courtesy!

461
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
A girl I don't like!

462
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
It didn't come out at all.

463
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
It didn't come out at all.

464
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
It didn't come out at all.

465
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
I thought it would.

466
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
It was too early.

467
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
It was pure white.

468
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Then why did you say such a thing?

469
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
I couldn't panic.

470
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
But you have to say it.

471
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
But I couldn't.

472
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
I wanted to lie down.

473
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I wanted to lie down on the letter E.

474
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
It didn't come out at all.

475
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
It didn't come out at all.

476
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
It didn't come out at all.

477
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I ask Matsumoto-san, the man who sends a message to every staff member.

478
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:03,700
When I went to the sauna the other day, a man with a picture on his back suddenly sat next to me.

479
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:09,100
I couldn't get out of the sauna right away, and I was so sweaty that I almost died.

480
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:11,500
What should I do to get out of this situation?

481
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:15,500
You don't have to say anything like that.

482
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:21,500
You have to lie so that you don't hurt the other person.

483
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:27,300
Just by saying a few words, your image of the other person changes completely.

484
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:28,300
When I get out of the sauna?

485
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:29,300
Yes, yes, yes.

486
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:35,300
When I get out of the sauna, I see the Yakuza coming.

487
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:37,300
It's not that hot.

488
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:42,300
I can tell.

489
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:44,300
It's not that hot.

490
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:48,300
Why do you sound like you're sulking?

491
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:51,300
Let's fight, Yakuza.

492
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:54,300
This is the best place.

493
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:58,300
Why do you want to fight? It's not like we're going to get out of the sauna.

494
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:01,300
So I say, sorry, it's not that hot.

495
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:03,300
And he says, hey, you're the Yakuza, right?

496
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:05,300
So I say, why are you going out?

497
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:07,300
And he says, I don't know.

498
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:09,300
At that time, I have no choice but to fight.

499
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:11,300
So I say, you're the Yakuza, right?

500
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:14,300
He says, I'm not that kind of Yakuza.

501
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:17,300
What kind of Yakuza are you talking about?

502
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:22,300
What kind of Yakuza are you talking about?

503
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:25,300
I don't know.

504
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:27,300
What the hell are you talking about?

505
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:29,300
Are you stupid?

506
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:31,300
What are you talking about?

507
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:35,300
Don't look at me like that.

508
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:37,300
I don't know what you're talking about.

509
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:38,300
The Yakuza?

510
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:41,300
It's hard to get out of the sauna as soon as you come in.

511
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:42,300
That's not true.

512
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:44,300
You shouldn't have come out.

513
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:47,300
I told you at the beginning.

514
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:49,300
You shouldn't have come out when I came in.

515
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:50,300
Did you say that?

516
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:51,300
I didn't say that.

517
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:52,300
Did you really say that?

518
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:54,300
I didn't say that.

519
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:55,300
I didn't say that.

520
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:57,300
Wait a minute.

521
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:58,300
You've been with me for 15 years.

522
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:03,300
You don't even know if I point my finger at you.

523
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:22,300
