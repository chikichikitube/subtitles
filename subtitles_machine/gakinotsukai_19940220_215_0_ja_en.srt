1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I did it!

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Let's move on to the next one.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
The first one is...

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Wada Ben, right?

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
And the next one is...

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Shigeki-chan.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Shimoda Kageki.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Kageki-chan.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Shigeki-chan.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
The color is a bit...

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
The color is a bit...

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
If you look at the bottom, it looks like Wakabayashi.

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
And the next one is...

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Kaganobaba.

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Kaganobaba.

16
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
That's enough.

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
That's enough.

18
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Thank you very much.

19
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Thank you very much.

20
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
This is not something to play with.

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I thought I could do it.

22
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
And this time...

23
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
And this time...

24
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Guts.

25
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I wonder how much you can tell the difference.

26
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Guts is...

27
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Guts Ishimatsu.

28
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
His real name is Yuji Suzuki.

29
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
He was born in Tochigi Prefecture in the year of Showa 24.

30
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Since he was a child, he has had a strong will to lose.

31
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Even if it was against an upperclassman, he has never lost in a fight.

32
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Guts Ishimatsu.

33
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
He made his debut in the boxing world as a transfer student.

34
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
He cut through the path of the rock with one fist.

35
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
In the year of Showa 49, he challenged for the world title.

36
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
He won the eight rounds of KO.

37
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
He was the first Japanese to win the world lightweight title.

38
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Even after his retirement, he made a comeback in the movie industry.

39
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
He was a producer, screenwriter, director, actor, and actor.

40
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
He was the center of attention in the entertainment industry.

41
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I'm Guts today.

42
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
It's a kiss special.

43
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Basically, it's a kiss.

44
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Hit me.

45
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I hope you do something good today.

46
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
100 points.

47
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Let's go to a bug.

48
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
A bug?

49
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Let's dig up Guts' shoes.

50
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
This is the best.

51
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Tighten your neck.

52
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
From the back.

53
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
This is not a big deal.

54
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
One point.

55
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
If you tighten your neck and say one point, it won't end.

56
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
From the back.

57
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I like it.

58
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
About 30 points.

59
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
How about kicking up your butt?

60
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I like it.

61
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
50,000 points.

62
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
100,000 points if you say AITAAA.

63
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
AITAAA.

64
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
If you say AITAAA, Guts will be like this.

65
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I'll start dancing.

66
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Start.

67
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Your face shape has changed.

68
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I'm Guts.

69
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Today's theme is boxing.

70
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I'm looking forward to it.

71
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
In many ways.

72
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Can I read it?

73
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Let's call him.

74
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Guts Ishimatsu.

75
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Thank you.

76
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Today's title is this.

77
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
How long have you been boxing?

78
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
16 years.

79
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Even if you quit boxing now,

80
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
if someone's hand comes like this,

81
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
will it go away in an instant?

82
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
It doesn't go away, but I avoid it.

83
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
You just avoid it?

84
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
You don't punch after avoiding it, do you?

85
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I don't do that.

86
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
You don't?

87
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
What are you doing?

88
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
We met a long time ago.

89
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Do you remember?

90
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Why?

91
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
What are you talking about?

92
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I think it was about 10 years ago.

93
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
We had an interview once.

94
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
That's right.

95
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
That's right.

96
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
It was 10 years ago.

97
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
After that, I was a judge.

98
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
You were a comedian.

99
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I was a judge.

100
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I always had a good taste.

101
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Is that so?

102
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
You had a good taste.

103
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Guts, are you okay?

104
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Do you still train?

105
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Sometimes.

106
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Sometimes?

107
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
What are you talking about?

108
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
This is...

109
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
It's Yamachan.

110
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
It's not Yamachan.

111
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
It's Hama-chan.

112
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Guts has been calling me Yamachan.

113
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
No?

114
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
It's Hama-chan.

115
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Do you want to arm wrestle with me?

116
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Arm wrestle?

117
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Let's do it.

118
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
This is good.

119
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Ready, start.

120
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Don't do it too seriously.

121
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
You're dirty.

122
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
If you do that, you won't be able to throw it.

123
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I'll show you how to do it.

124
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Your arms are big.

125
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Stop calling me a snake.

126
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
You kicked me just now.

127
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Guts, let's do a shadow.

128
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
What was your name again?

129
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I'll show you again.

130
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
When it comes...

131
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Ouch.

132
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I'll kill you.

133
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Ready, start.

134
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Ouch.

135
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
It really hurts.

136
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
It's Yamachan.

137
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
It's Yamachan.

138
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I'll show you how to do it.

139
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
He's throwing it.

140
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
It's amazing.

141
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
It's amazing.

142
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Please remember this.

143
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Thank you very much.

144
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Thank you very much.

145
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I'm sorry.

146
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Thank you very much.

147
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Let's announce the result.

148
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
You two were really scared.

149
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
It was really scary.

150
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I was really nervous.

151
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I was really nervous.

152
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I was really nervous.

153
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
When you were doing this...

154
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I was really nervous.

155
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I was really nervous.

156
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Even though you were being taught, it was really scary.

157
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Let's see the result.

158
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Let's see the result.

159
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Matsumoto's score.

160
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Matsumoto's score.

161
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
68 points.

162
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
68 points.

163
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
My score.

164
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I still have one more line. 163,446 points.

165
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:23,180
Let's do the

166
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:30,180
last one.

167
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:36,180
I thought I'd never say it, but I said it once.

168
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:39,180
That's 100,000 points.

169
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:42,180
It's big.

170
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:46,180
Today was the scariest out of the three times.

171
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:51,180
That's what I'm scared of.

172
00:08:51,180 --> 00:09:03,180
My legs are shaking, too.

173
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:07,180
It snowed a lot.

174
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:09,180
It snowed a lot.

175
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:11,180
What's that?

176
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:13,180
It doesn't snow in Osaka.

177
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:16,180
In Osaka?

178
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:18,180
No, in Tokyo.

179
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:22,180
It doesn't snow in Osaka, so I'm not used to it.

180
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:24,180
I can't handle it.

181
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:28,180
Why do you say it twice?

182
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:32,180
I don't want you to laugh like that.

183
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:43,180
I couldn't get out at all.

184
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:46,180
I couldn't get out on that snowy day.

185
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:50,180
It snowed twice this year, didn't it?

186
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:52,180
I don't know.

187
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:54,180
It snowed twice, didn't it?

188
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:57,180
The first time it snowed was funny.

189
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:59,180
I was watching TV alone.

190
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:00,180
In the middle of the night.

191
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:01,180
I was watching TV alone.

192
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:04,180
I was watching TV alone in the middle of the night.

193
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:09,180
Then I heard a sound.

194
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:16,180
I looked out of the window, and I saw a car crash.

195
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:22,180
I got out of the car and looked at the car.

196
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:24,180
I looked at the TV again.

197
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:28,180
The car crashed again.

198
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:32,180
The taxi driver crashed again.

199
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:35,180
There were about five cars in Akihata.

200
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:38,180
I couldn't do anything about it.

201
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:41,180
It's okay if you're an amateur.

202
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:47,180
If a person who is famous for his face falls into the snow, it's very cool.

203
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:54,180
The entrance to the video studio in Shibuya is very slippery.

204
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:59,180
When I was told that it was a match, I was surprised.

205
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:07,180
I was surprised.

206
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:08,180
It's over.

207
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:11,180
I'm a fool.

208
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:13,180
What?

209
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:15,180
I'm tired of being fooled.

210
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:18,180
That's not true.

211
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:23,180
I went to the hospital yesterday.

212
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:25,180
Hospital?

213
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:27,180
Why did you go to the hospital?

214
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:32,180
I want to have beautiful seams.

215
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:34,180
Aikata has found out.

216
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:36,180
I told him to hide his chest a bit more.

217
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:38,180
When he came out, he was all stiff.

218
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:40,180
Oh, that's amazing.

219
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:41,180
Right?

220
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:43,180
When he came out, he was all stiff.

221
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:45,180
He was like this.

222
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:48,180
He didn't burn, but he was like this.

223
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:50,180
When he came out, he was like this.

224
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:54,180
He was laughing like this.

225
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:58,180
When I looked up, I saw two ugly nurses.

226
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:00,180
They were laughing like this.

227
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:04,180
They were laughing like this.

228
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:06,180
That's hurtful.

229
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:08,180
You can't say that.

230
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:10,180
He was like this.

231
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:18,180
I've been doing a lot of research.

232
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:20,180
Right?

233
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:24,180
About being lucky.

234
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:26,180
Lucky?

235
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:28,180
Lucky?

236
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:32,180
I think everyone needs to know more about being lucky.

237
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:35,180
Of course, I think about it every day.

238
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:37,180
You think about it every day?

239
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:40,180
What do you mean by lucky every day?

240
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:44,180
Everyone uses the word lucky very wrongly.

241
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,180
Really?

242
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:49,180
For example, let's say you're in a hurry to go home.

243
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:51,180
You don't stop at any traffic lights.

244
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:55,180
If you can go without stopping, that's lucky.

245
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:58,180
That's not lucky.

246
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:01,180
Well, well, well.

247
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:03,180
You can say that to me now.

248
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:05,180
10 minutes later,

249
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:07,180
Mr. Matsumoto is nice.

250
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:08,180
No, no, no.

251
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:09,180
Please hug him.

252
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:10,180
No, no, no.

253
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:12,180
I can't do that.

254
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:14,180
I'll ask you.

255
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:19,180
For example, let's say you went to eat something.

256
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:21,180
What do you want to eat?

257
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:23,180
Do you want to eat curry rice?

258
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:26,180
Or do you want to eat hayashi rice?

259
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,180
I don't eat the same thing.

260
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:30,180
Let's say you have two friends.

261
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:32,180
You want to eat curry rice.

262
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:34,180
Your friend wants to eat hayashi rice.

263
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,180
Hayashi rice was very bad.

264
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:37,180
The curry rice was very delicious.

265
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:38,180
Are you lucky?

266
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:39,180
Lucky?

267
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:41,180
No!

268
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:45,180
The curry rice there is delicious from the beginning.

269
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:52,180
If you do something different, that's right.

270
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:54,180
For example, if you go on a trip,

271
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:56,180
you're always looking at Mr. Hamada.

272
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:57,180
When you get off, you're told,

273
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:58,180
I have money today.

274
00:13:58,180 --> 00:13:59,180
Are you lucky?

275
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:00,180
Lucky?

276
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:02,180
No!

277
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:04,180
Lucky?

278
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:06,180
What did you say about money?

279
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:08,180
Are you stupid?

280
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:12,180
Did you listen to the class when you were a third grader?

281
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:16,180
I don't know what it is.

282
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:17,180
It's been three years.

283
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:19,180
No, no.

284
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:23,180
Are you lucky?

285
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:25,180
You really don't understand.

286
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:26,180
That was your idea.

287
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:27,180
That was my idea.

288
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:29,180
Are you lucky now?

289
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:30,180
Well, then.

290
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:31,180
What is it?

291
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:32,180
I'm curious.

292
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:34,180
Let's look at the answer.

293
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:37,180
What are you doing?

294
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:39,180
If you're a third grader, you'll understand.

295
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:40,180
Everyone is nervous.

296
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:41,180
Let's look at the answer.

297
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:42,180
What did he say?

298
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:45,180
Let me tell you about curry.

299
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:48,180
That curry was originally delicious curry.

300
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:49,180
That's fine.

301
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:51,180
I've noticed something.

302
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:58,180
Lucky changes depending on what you're lucky with.

303
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:00,180
But that's not for me.

304
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:02,180
Everyone can't say lucky.

305
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:03,180
But it's for me.

306
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:04,180
Well, well, well, well, well, well.

307
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:06,180
Listen.

308
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:09,180
This is where it really comes out.

309
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:11,180
What are you looking at?

310
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:12,180
I'm not doing anything.

311
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:13,180
I don't accept anything.

312
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:15,180
I'm lucky because the signal has changed.

313
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:18,180
Listen!

314
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:20,180
But!

315
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:25,180
When I wanted to eat curry, I happened to go into that delicious curry shop.

316
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:31,180
I'm lucky about that.

317
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:33,180
I dropped my wallet.

318
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:34,180
What?

319
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:37,180
You dropped your wallet.

320
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:39,180
Have you gone crazy?

321
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:40,180
What should I do?

322
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:44,180
You have to be careful.

323
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:48,180
Next, click, click, click, click.

324
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:52,180
That's not the case.

325
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:54,180
Click, click, click.

326
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:59,180
Click, click.

327
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:00,180
Well, well, well, well.

328
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:01,180
That's enough.

329
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:05,180
I want you to tell me the details.

330
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:07,180
I dropped my wallet and was depressed.

331
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:10,180
I found my wallet about two days later.

332
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:12,180
Were you lucky at this time?

333
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:15,180
I was lucky.

334
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:18,180
You're really stupid.

335
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:19,180
I was lucky.

336
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:21,180
I dropped my wallet and was found.

337
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,180
You're really late now.

338
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:25,180
You have to work hard.

339
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:29,180
You're really bad.

340
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:30,180
I didn't wait for you.

341
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:31,180
It's okay.

342
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:32,180
It's okay.

343
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:40,180
You're lucky.

344
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:43,180
You don't have to look so cute.

345
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:48,180
Click, click, click, click.

346
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:50,180
Click, click, click, click.

347
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:52,180
That's enough.

348
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:53,180
That's not the case.

349
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:56,180
I want you to tell me the details.

350
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:59,180
I don't have any.

351
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:02,180
When I first said it,

352
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:04,180
about 10 minutes ago,

353
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:08,180
everyone was surprised.

354
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:11,180
But after listening to my speech,

355
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:12,180
Thank you, Matsumoto.

356
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:13,180
Do it. Do it.

357
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:16,180
What are you talking about?

358
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:21,180
People who say that.

359
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:23,180
Please raise your hand a little.

360
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:27,180
That hurts.

361
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:28,180
That's enough.

362
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:29,180
That's enough.

363
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:30,180
Everyone, come over here.

364
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:34,180
Danbaron.

365
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:38,180
Thank you.

366
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:42,180
Is that so?

367
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:45,180
Okay.

368
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:46,180
What is this?

369
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:48,180
What's okay?

370
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:53,180
Are you lucky to have me and downtown?

371
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:55,180
It's okay.

372
00:17:55,180 --> 00:18:00,180
Hmm?

373
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:01,180
I heard something.

374
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:04,180
Your wife, Natsumi, used to be a fan of Matsumoto.

375
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:09,180
Liar.

376
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:10,180
Is that true?

377
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:11,180
What?

378
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:12,180
Wait a minute.

379
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:15,180
What was that?

380
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:18,180
What?

381
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:20,180
I didn't know this.

382
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:23,180
No, it's not.

383
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:24,180
No, it's not.

384
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:26,180
No, it's not.

385
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:27,180
That's right.

386
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:30,180
That's right.

387
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:32,180
Is that so?

388
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:35,180
No, it's not.

389
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:38,180
I'll send you 50 roses.

390
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:39,180
Thank you.

391
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:46,180
Your child is also a fan of mine.

392
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:48,180
Why?

393
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:49,180
Well, well, well.

394
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:52,180
Say hello.

395
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:54,180
Hello.

396
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:57,180
Why do you close your eyes when you kiss?

397
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:59,180
Matsumoto, do you close your eyes?

398
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:01,180
If I open my eyes, it's hard to die.

399
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:02,180
What?

400
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:03,180
If I open my eyes, it's hard to die.

401
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:06,180
Do you close your eyes?

402
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:09,180
Wow, cute.

403
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:10,180
Men don't close their eyes.

404
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:12,180
Women do.

405
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:17,180
You keep your eyes open all the time.

406
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:22,180
I don't know how much you know.

407
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:24,180
What are you talking about?

408
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:27,180
Eyes and mouth are opposite.

409
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:28,180
What do you mean?

410
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:29,180
Eyes and mouth are closed.

411
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:33,180
When your mouth is open, you close your eyes.

412
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:42,180
For example, when you get on the roller coaster, you scream.

413
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:43,180
Hey, hey.

414
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:51,180
What?

415
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:58,180
When I do a French kiss...

416
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:00,180
What?

417
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:02,180
When I do a light kiss...

418
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:04,180
French kiss?

419
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:12,180
My eyes are open.

420
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:15,180
Disgusting.

421
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:26,180
When I do a deep kiss, my mouth is open.

422
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:28,180
Why do you close your eyes?

423
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:33,180
Telecom, telecom, telecom.

424
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:36,180
I'm sorry, Machan.

425
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:39,180
I love your work.

426
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:41,180
I've been your fan for a year and a half.

427
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:45,180
It seems that the world we live in is too different.

428
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:48,180
It's hard for me to be sad anymore, so I'll say goodbye here.

429
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:51,180
I was happy to see a lot of Machan in a year and a half.

430
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:54,180
I wanted to see Machan with my own eyes just once.

431
00:20:54,180 --> 00:21:00,180
Don't send me a blue note.

432
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:05,180
Goodbye and thank you.

433
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:07,180
It's really blue.

434
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:09,180
I don't like it.

435
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:12,180
I'm sorry, Machan.

436
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:15,180
Why do you want so much?

437
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:18,180
You can just watch TV as a fan.

438
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:20,180
I'm a little too into it.

439
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:22,180
You're trying to get into it, aren't you?

440
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:25,180
I said something like that the other day, but I don't think so.

441
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:28,180
There's someone who wrote me a letter saying that I'm saying it to my man.

442
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:31,180
I'll never forget what you said at that time.

443
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:33,180
What did you say?

444
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:35,180
I don't know what you're talking about.

445
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:38,180
I don't know what you're talking about.

446
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:45,180
You don't even know that you're different from what you really look like on TV, do you?

447
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:47,180
I'm really like that.

448
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:49,180
You don't change much, do you?

449
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:51,180
I usually wear a microphone like this.

450
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:53,180
Why?

451
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:56,180
You're a pervert.

452
00:21:56,180 --> 00:22:03,180
When I see you on a regular basis, I think you're completely different from what I imagine.

453
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:05,180
You really make me laugh.

454
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:06,180
Why?

455
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:08,180
What do you mean?

456
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:12,180
When I see you on a regular basis, I think you're completely different from what I imagine.

457
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:37,180
It's called justice.
