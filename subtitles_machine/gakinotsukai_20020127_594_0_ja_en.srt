1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Next up is the Suwa presents stress relief show, the Nico Nico Auto Bus Tour!

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Today, we have Suwa-chan's...

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Yes, yes, yes.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Please take us somewhere.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Yes, yes.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Let's go somewhere.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Yes, yes.

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Well, to be honest, I'm not that good at this.

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Why?

10
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
No, Suwa-chan, you should go first.

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Thank you very much.

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Your gyalas won't be up for sale from April.

13
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
They won't be up for sale?

14
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
That's a very clear mistake.

15
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
That's why you're so gorgeous today.

16
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Oh, today?

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Oh, I see.

18
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
But there's something I'm a little worried about.

19
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I want to avoid trouble.

20
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
You know, we're all talented.

21
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
If you go to various places, you'll meet various people.

22
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
It's going to be fun.

23
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I wonder where they'll take us.

24
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
That's something to look forward to.

25
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm looking forward to it.

26
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
This program is brought to you by the sponsors.

27
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
So, let's talk about the theme.

28
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
First, the theme.

29
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
The theme, huh?

30
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I haven't been there much.

31
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I've only been to Kiboto.

32
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
You've been there, haven't you?

33
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Why have you been there?

34
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Why are you here?

35
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm here to perform a song from Odaiba.

36
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
What song?

37
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm here to perform Miracle Type.

38
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I heard you're doing a comedy show.

39
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
It's like a reenactment drama.

40
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
You can't say it's a comedy show.

41
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
You can't say it's a comedy show.

42
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I've been here before.

43
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I've been here before.

44
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
You've been here before?

45
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I do listen to it a lot.

46
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:51,500
Why?

47
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,000
At work.

48
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Really?

49
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
You haven't been to the TV station recently?

50
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
No, no.

51
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Just today?

52
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
No, no. I don't really go to work.

53
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I don't really look at the scenery.

54
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I do look at the camera like this, but I've never seen a bigger one.

55
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:14,000
After the school trip, they headed to the popular tourist spot, Odaiba, in a fun atmosphere.

56
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,000
The restaurant is a bit small, but it's better than the real thing.

57
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
One tenth smaller.

58
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
This is what couples come to see, right?

59
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
That's right.

60
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
They come to see and ask how it is.

61
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
They're running a restaurant.

62
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
It looks good.

63
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Let's eat.

64
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I'll eat while I'm eating.

65
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I'm hungry.

66
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I'm hungry.

67
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I'm hungry.

68
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Looks delicious.

69
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Let's eat.

70
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Let's eat.

71
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Hello.

72
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
What do you want to eat?

73
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I don't know.

74
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I want to eat yakisoba.

75
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I want to eat yakisoba.

76
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Yakisoba?

77
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Yes.

78
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
But we only have one.

79
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
We have to buy one.

80
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
That's right.

81
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
What should I do?

82
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
You can get a hot dog.

83
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I don't know the character of Enzo.

84
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I'll get a hot dog.

85
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
What about you, Zaki?

86
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
What do you want to eat?

87
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Zaki, do you want yakisoba?

88
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I'll get a hot dog.

89
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I'll get a yakisoba.

90
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Yakisoba?

91
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I'll get a yakisoba.

92
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Zaki.

93
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Zaki.

94
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Hey, Mr. Yamazaki.

95
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Hey, Mr. Yamazaki.

96
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Hey, Mr. Yamazaki.

97
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Yamazaki.

98
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Hey, Mr. Yamazaki.

99
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Hey, Mr. Yamazaki.

100
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
What are you doing?

101
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
What are you doing?

102
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Don't come close.

103
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I'm sorry.

104
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I noticed you and you started to look at me.

105
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I didn't do anything.

106
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
You did it.

107
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I looked at you and you started to look at me.

108
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Stop asking about the noodle place.

109
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Stop it.

110
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I don't want to.

111
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
That's not the case.

112
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
The business over there...

113
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
That's right.

114
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
They won't come to the noodle place.

115
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
But...

116
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
You've seen it all, haven't you?

117
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I've seen it all.

118
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
You're mistaken.

119
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
That's right.

120
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
That's right.

121
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Yamaguchi-san, Yamaguchi-san.

122
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
What are you doing?

123
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I'm done.

124
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I see.

125
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Let's have fun.

126
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Let's have fun.

127
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Let's have fun.

128
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Let's have fun.

129
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
No more.

130
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Please, Yogiya Yama!

131
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I was scared.

132
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Please.

133
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Please.

134
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Don't cut it.

135
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Wow!

136
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
It's good.

137
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
The usual song is good.

138
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
It's good.

139
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Is there such a rock?

140
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I wonder if it was already there.

141
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
How is it?

142
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
There's a place where I did rock music.

143
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Ah, that's the place.

144
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I did it! I did a battle with Kuma.

145
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Ah, I see.

146
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
That's around here.

147
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
It's calm.

148
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
It's good that you have a good choice, Tsukawa-san.

149
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Thank you.

150
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Then, let's drink some tea.

151
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Let's go.

152
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Let's go.

153
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
This is my first time.

154
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Wow, it's cute.

155
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
It's cute.

156
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Mameshiba!

157
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
So cute!

158
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Mameshiba is so cute!

159
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
So cute!

160
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
It's not bad.

161
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
It's not bad for the eyes.

162
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Hey, Mr. Tsushima.

163
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I'm leaving.

164
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
What are you doing?

165
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I'm sorry.

166
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Didn't you die?

167
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Hey, you too.

168
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
You too, wait a minute.

169
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I'm sorry.

170
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I'll be waiting.

171
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
What's wrong?

172
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
What are you doing?

173
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I'm sorry.

174
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
What's wrong?

175
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I hate that kind of girl.

176
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Why are you so old?

177
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Are you taking a walk?

178
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Why are you so angry?

179
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I'm surprised.

180
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Please.

181
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
It's like a talent show.

182
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Yeah, yeah.

183
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I didn't realize it was going on for so long.

184
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Is it because I'm talking?

185
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Although he had some small troubles, he decided to get back on his feet and enjoy shopping.

186
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
It's true, it's true.

187
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
It's good that it's on sale.

188
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I've never been with you before.

189
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Me neither.

190
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Let's go shopping!

191
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Let's go shopping!

192
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Can I buy something?

193
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Sure.

194
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
What a young lady.

195
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Yeah.

196
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
What?

197
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
What?

198
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Who are you?

199
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Let's go shopping.

200
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
What?

201
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Let's go.

202
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
What?

203
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Why?

204
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Why?

205
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
What's that face?

206
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
What's that face?

207
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Hey, hey, hey.

208
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
What are you doing?

209
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Stop it.

210
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
What's wrong?

211
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Hey, hey.

212
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
You're a young lady.

213
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Sorry.

214
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Sorry.

215
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Excuse me.

216
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
You're going to cut your nails?

217
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
No, no.

218
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I don't think I would cut my nails.

219
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I wanted to do something.

220
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
You're going to look at me with a dirty look.

221
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
That's right.

222
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I'm going to look at you with a dirty look.

223
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I'm going to look at you with a dirty look.

224
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I'm going to look at you with a dirty look.

225
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I know that kind of thing.

226
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I've been doing it for a long time.

227
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
If you were a professional, you would have been able to do it.

228
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
That's right.

229
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Right?

230
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Why do you have to compete with an amateur?

231
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
That's right.

232
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Osamu-san, you said you were going to do it.

233
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
We are also amateurs.

234
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Amateurs?

235
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
You just said that.

236
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
What's wrong with you?

237
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I'm over 40.

238
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
You're working in the industry.

239
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
You're a fool.

240
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
But what about this hat?

241
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
It's popular now.

242
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
It's a good thing.

243
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Stop it.

244
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
It's a good thing.

245
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I'll buy you a new one.

246
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I'll buy you a new one.

247
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I'll wear this all the time.

248
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I'll wear this all the time.

249
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Really?

250
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I can wear it for many years.

251
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Oh, I see.

252
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
What?

253
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
You want to wear it?

254
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
No, I'm fine.

255
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I'm glad you're the only one who bought it.

256
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Thank you.

257
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Oh, it's a face mask.

258
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
It's a face mask.

259
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Do you want to try it?

260
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Oh, my God.

261
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Oh, this is ours.

262
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Oh, really?

263
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Don't you have a ticket?

264
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I'm not laughing.

265
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I'm laughing at my own game.

266
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I'm laughing at my own game.

267
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
What?

268
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Let's go over there.

269
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I told you to stop looking around.

270
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I'm not looking.

271
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Look around.

272
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Everyone is looking around.

273
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Stop it.

274
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I told you to stop looking around.

275
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I'm sorry.

276
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Everyone is looking around.

277
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Stop it.

278
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Stop it!

279
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Stop it!

280
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Sorry, Nishan.

281
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Sorry.

282
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
You can't do a location.

283
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I can't.

284
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
You can't use it.

285
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I can't.

286
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I can't.

287
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
What is it?

288
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Why are you angry?

289
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
What did you do?

290
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
What did you do?

291
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I don't know.

292
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I was just looking at the face.

293
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
But you did something.

294
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I'm not that angry.

295
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
What is it?

296
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Let's stop here.

297
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Let's go to the bus.

298
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I'm sorry.

299
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
It's a very good item.

300
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
The next destination is the ship's science museum.

301
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I want to display it sometimes.

302
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Thank you very much.

303
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
You display amazing things.

304
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Yes, it's pretty good.

305
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
It's good.

306
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
It's good.

307
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I want to see it.

308
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I don't have time to study this.

309
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
This way.

310
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Can I go in now?

311
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Yes, please prepare it properly.

312
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Thank you very much.

313
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Let's go.

314
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Let's go.

315
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Let's go.

316
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Let's go in.

317
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Let's go in.

318
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
It's an exhibition hall.

319
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Let's go in.

320
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Yes.

321
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Let's go.

322
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
It's cold.

323
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
My feet are frozen.

324
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
My feet are frozen.

325
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
My feet are frozen.

326
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
My feet are frozen.

327
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
My feet are frozen.

328
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
This is...

329
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I don't know why.

330
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
This is bad.

331
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
This is bad.

332
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Wait, wait, wait.

333
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Wait, wait, wait.

334
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Wait, wait, wait.

335
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Wait.

336
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
What are you doing?

337
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Masa, what are you doing?

338
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Come here.

339
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
He's being stepped on.

340
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
His feet.

341
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
His feet.

342
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
He's even being stepped on.

343
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
You too.

344
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
What is this?

345
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
What is this?

346
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
What is this?

347
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
What is this?

348
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
No, no, no.

349
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I was just about to enter.

350
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
What is this?

351
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
He clearly came after me.

352
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Kevin-san stood up.

353
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Sorry.

354
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
You're the one who stepped on my foot.

355
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Me?

356
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
No, I've been stepped on since the second half.

357
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Let's have fun.

358
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Let's have fun.

359
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Let's have fun.

360
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Have fun.

361
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Have fun.

362
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
This is not good.

363
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Let's change it from here.

364
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Let's have fun.

365
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I think it's okay to look at the order.

366
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Can I look at it?

367
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Yes, you can.

368
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Yamato is cool.

369
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Yamato is cool.

370
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
He's cool.

371
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
He's cool.

372
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
What are you doing?

373
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
What are you doing?

374
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I'm stretching my hand.

375
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
You're stretching your hand.

376
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I'm stretching my back.

377
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

378
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
What the hell?

379
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
What are you doing?

380
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Hey, Mr. Nekko.

381
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
What are you doing?

382
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Sorry.

383
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Sorry.

384
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
What are you doing?

385
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Ah, wait, wait.

386
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
You, you, too, too.

387
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
You're a child, aren't you?

388
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
What's wrong with you?

389
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
What's wrong?

390
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
You're a child, aren't you?

391
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I'm small, but I'm a little big.

392
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Stop it.

393
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Stop it.

394
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I am a man.

395
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
At that time...

396
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I said something like a mature man.

397
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I am 47 years old.

398
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
47 years old, right?

399
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Please forgive me.

400
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I am over 40 years old.

401
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I thought so.

402
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I'm sorry.

403
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I thought so.

404
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Sorry, sorry.

405
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
If it was that girl, the other guys would have been in trouble.

406
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:32,000
The broken surface area finally reacts, and the trouble that they should have avoided continues for some reason.

407
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
While trying to calm down, they head to Pallet Town.

408
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Wow, it's beautiful!

409
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Isn't it?

410
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
It's amazing.

411
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
It's beautiful when the lights are on.

412
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
What is this? It's like a car exhibition.

413
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
It's a Toyota.

414
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Toyota.

415
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Toyota.

416
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Toyota.

417
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Toyota is good.

418
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Toyota is good.

419
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Let's see the car.

420
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Is it OK?

421
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I want to see it.

422
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
It's like a statue.

423
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I'm sorry.

424
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
It's okay.

425
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
You can't do that to an old lady.

426
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
That's right.

427
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I'm gonna cry.

428
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I was so surprised.

429
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Let's have fun.

430
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
It was a good choice for you.

431
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Let's go to the Ferris wheel.

432
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Driver, please.

433
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I'm scared.

434
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Let's go.

435
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Let's go.

436
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Let's go.

437
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Let's go.

438
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Let's go.

439
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Let's go.

440
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Let's go.

441
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Your face is big.

442
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Big face.

443
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
You look scary.

444
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Of course it is.

445
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Well, well, well, well.

446
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,000
In the end, we've been talking about it for so long, but now it's finally time for you to go.

447
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Oh, that's right.

448
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Well, I don't think I've had much reaction from the audience.

449
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
That's right.

450
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
We're looking forward to it.

451
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Well, we're looking forward to it.

452
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I'd like you to die this time, Yamazaki.

453
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
What about it?

454
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Come on, Yamazaki.

455
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Well, well, well, won't it grow more?

456
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Won't it be around April?

457
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I don't really like it.

458
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Why?

459
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:42,500
Why?

460
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,500
I wonder why?

461
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,500
It's even more tiring.

462
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,500
It's not tiring or long and hectic.

463
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,500
It's scary.

464
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,500
Really, Morimang is scary.

465
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,000
Seiji, did you watch the match?

466
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I haven't watched it yet.

467
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
What did you do?

468
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Oh, the New Year's party?

469
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I'm really angry at Yamashita.

470
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,500
That's not true.

471
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,500
He really died.

472
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:12,500
I can't die from being shot at close range.

473
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,500
Because it's a taxi.

474
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:19,500
But you didn't even ask for it on that day, but you came to Takishido and did it.

475
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:22,500
That was the Takishido I still drink.

476
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,500
I don't spend any money on it.

477
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,500
I drink recently.

478
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,500
I thought I shouldn't drink and drive.

479
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,500
I asked Yamashita to drive.

480
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,500
I sometimes ask for it.

481
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,500
When I got home, I thought it was bad.

482
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:37,500
I don't need a taxi.

483
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,500
I was eating a lot of food.

484
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:42,500
I had no choice but to drive because I had no money.

485
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,500
I had no money.

486
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,500
I had 850 yen in my pocket.

487
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,500
I asked him if I needed this.

488
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,500
He said, I don't need it because I can cut the steering wheel.

489
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,500
Is that true?

490
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,500
It's true.

491
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,500
I only have this.

492
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:00,500
I don't care if it's an old man or something.

493
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,500
I don't care if it's a classroom.

494
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,500
I'm going to eat it.

495
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:07,500
That's the worst!

496
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:10,500
There was a point card incident.

497
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:13,500
Junior's younger brother moved.

498
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,500
He said, I'll move.

499
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:18,500
I went to the TV station.

500
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:21,500
It was about 100,000 yen.

501
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:24,500
That's all.

502
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,500
I was moved by the point card incident.

503
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,500
Where's the point card?

504
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,500
You're talking about something weird.

505
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,500
I don't have anything.

506
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,500
You should just go.

507
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,500
What is this?

508
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,500
You should have told me about the point card.

509
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:46,500
I was just spending money and looking at other places.

510
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,500
I was with Yamashita.

511
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,500
And then, you know, the point card...

512
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,500
What do you want to do?

513
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,500
What do you want to do with the point card?

514
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,500
He was so angry.

515
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,500
Please do something about it.

516
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,500
I said, that's your point card!

517
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:04,180
He said, your point card is a

518
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:06,180
stupid car!

519
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:08,180
I have his point card!

520
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:12,660
That's also a point card I made when I was in high school!

521
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:14,660
It's not his!

522
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:16,660
He pushed it away!

523
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:19,660
He's good enough to be a judge of the school's case.

524
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:22,660
It's terrible.

525
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:26,660
When I was in Guam, it was raining.

526
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:28,660
To be honest, I was playing cards.

527
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:31,660
I was playing blackjack.

528
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:36,660
I was playing 5 times and 21 points.

529
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:38,660
I was playing 5 times.

530
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:39,660
I was like,

531
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:41,660
Come on!

532
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:43,660
My parents came to me.

533
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:45,660
Yes!

534
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:48,660
I was in the middle of the game.

535
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:51,660
The whole theater was in a mess.

536
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:57,660
That's like a mood food!

537
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:01,660
You shouldn't have killed him!

538
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:03,660
That's a Tsuba!

539
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:08,660
Tsuba-chan's jacket is deep green!

540
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:11,660
That's a Tsuba!

541
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:13,660
You're wearing a pizza!

542
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:16,660
That's so stupid!

543
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:18,660
Hey!

544
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:26,660
After eating at a restaurant, I feel a little bit of superiority in putting out the Platinum card of American Express.

545
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:31,660
What is the superiority of being a successful Matsumoto-san class?

546
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:37,660
Certainly, well, well, well, I don't care anymore.

547
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:41,660
What are you talking about?

548
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:44,660
In the past, I was worried about more things.

549
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:46,660
What are you talking about?

550
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:55,660
I forget all the economic things and all the things that I can do to save money.

551
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:59,660
I'm quite a big fan of yours.

552
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:01,660
Big fan of yours?

553
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:08,660
Because you open the fridge like BAM!

554
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,660
Everyone does that.

555
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:11,660
No, no, no.

556
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:12,660
Everyone does that.

557
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:18,660
I want to see the energy of the people who earn money.

558
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:22,660
I will cool it down anytime.

559
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:25,660
Everyone will give you money.

560
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:28,660
I can't do it without money.

561
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:30,660
It's a game.

562
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:33,660
It used to be a game.

563
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:37,660
It's like a game of getting caught in the middle.

564
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:40,660
I will definitely do that.

565
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:42,660
I'm not doing that.

566
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:44,660
You must have used tissue a lot.

567
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:46,660
In the past, you didn't use it that much.

568
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:48,660
That's not true.

569
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:49,660
I hate it.

570
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:51,660
When a woman comes and spills something,

571
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:53,660
I go like Bap Bap Bap Bap Bap Bap Bap Bap Bap.

572
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:56,660
Oh, oh, oh, long, long, long, long.

573
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:57,660
No, no, no, no.

574
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:59,660
I use it all the time.

575
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:02,660
I don't need such an uneducated woman now.

576
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:04,660
That's a long time ago.

577
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:08,660
I'm all about Bap Bap Bap Bap now.

578
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:09,660
Really?

579
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:14,660
No, no, really, really, now I'm able to earn money by myself.

580
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:17,660
I've changed a lot.

581
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:20,660
In the past, when I used to do this,

582
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:26,660
I used to do it with a good feeling of cutting the hair.

583
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:31,660
I used to do it the other way around, but recently I've been doing it like this.

584
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:35,660
You used to do it the other way around and still be able to use it here.

585
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:39,660
I thought I was going to get it again.

586
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:43,660
But now, the environment is already...

587
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:45,660
You don't have to worry about it.

588
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:48,660
I don't have to worry about it anymore.

589
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:50,660
It's a big deal.

590
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:52,660
It's a little detailed.

591
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:55,660
It's fine, but it's important.

592
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:58,660
There's a net.

593
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:01,660
A net for pouring water.

594
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:05,660
That... is only a little bit of it, but you throw it away...

595
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:06,660
Just a little more...

596
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:09,660
Until it comes, just leave it there.

597
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:10,660
You...

598
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:12,660
You!
