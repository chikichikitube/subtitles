1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Today's guests are very energetic.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Very energetic.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Why are you so excited?

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
This program is brought to you by these sponsors.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Thank goodness.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Only the guests are energetic.

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
That's not true.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
That's not true.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm not that energetic.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm a little tired.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
That's why I'm going to talk for 4 hours today.

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
What does this say?

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Sherry?

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
You're Sherry.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
From today.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Nice to meet you, Sherry.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The other day, when I was walking around,

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I saw a handwritten paper at a bar.

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
A set of horoyoi.

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
How much was it?

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
About 1200 yen.

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
A horoyoi set.

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
With one beer.

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
That's good.

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
And a set of oden.

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I'll leave that to the store.

27
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I see.

28
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I saw that handwritten paper.

29
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I was very depressed.

30
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Why?

31
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I don't know.

32
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Why?

33
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Isn't it blue?

34
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
That's not true.

35
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
That's very kind of you.

36
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Really?

37
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
We're shooting a drama right now.

38
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I don't really go to the restaurant.

39
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
It's not very good.

40
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I like the restaurant.

41
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
It's the worst.

42
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
What's that?

43
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Rice variety.

44
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
A rice variety.

45
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
There's no rice.

46
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
It's a yakisoba set.

47
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Where's the rice variety?

48
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I think the English is a little wrong.

49
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
It's wrong.

50
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
That's very kind of you.

51
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
It's not like that.

52
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I'll be done soon.

53
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
That's enough.

54
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
It's very sad.

55
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
A hard-working salaryman.

56
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
A set like that.

57
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
It's very sad.

58
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
But it's okay.

59
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
It's a set of beer.

60
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
What set?

61
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
A horoyoi set.

62
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
It's okay.

63
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
It's sad.

64
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
You should have at least chosen four oden.

65
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
There's a lot.

66
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
And konnyaku.

67
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
There might be three konnyaku in it.

68
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
That's impossible.

69
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
You don't know, do you?

70
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
There might be konnyaku in it.

71
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
That's impossible.

72
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
But you have to leave it to the restaurant.

73
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
That's impossible.

74
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
It's very non-calorie.

75
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
It's okay.

76
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
It's very non-calorie.

77
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
It was very blue.

78
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I'm sorry.

79
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I feel bad.

80
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
It sounded like you had money.

81
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
That's okay.

82
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Is that so?

83
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
It's okay.

84
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I didn't want to talk about this at all.

85
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
There was a writer, Kramos.

86
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
He was in a car.

87
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
A foreign couple was fighting over there.

88
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
A man and a woman.

89
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
They were amazing.

90
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
The man was like,

91
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
He was in a hurry.

92
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
He hit the hood of Kramos' car.

93
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:51,000
What should I do?

94
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
That's scary.

95
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
It's scary.

96
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
It's scary.

97
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,000
What?

98
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
You couldn't do anything.

99
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
That's right.

100
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
It can't be helped.

101
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
It can't be helped.

102
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
It can't be helped.

103
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
It can't be helped.

104
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I was in a car once before.

105
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
The car in front of me was down.

106
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I was like,

107
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
It's okay.

108
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
When I dashed to that car,

109
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
My mirror went like this.

110
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
You hit it.

111
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I hit it.

112
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
It went like this.

113
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
It went like this.

114
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Me?

115
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Me?

116
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
That's not true.

117
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
That's not true.

118
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
They were very excited.

119
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
They were like,

120
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I don't want that car to come this way.

121
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
They were very excited.

122
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:47,000
They were very excited.

123
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
That's not true.

124
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
That's a bad thing.

125
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
To Mr. Katsumoto.

126
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Yes.

127
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
How big is the door of Megane-saru's glasses?

128
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I don't know.

129
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I don't know where to put it.

130
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I'm waiting for a place to put it.

131
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I'm waiting for a place to put it.

132
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Normally,

133
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
That's right.

134
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,000
It was just said that it was a animal doctor.

135
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I don't think it was said.

136
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
It was said that it was a animal doctor.

137
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Is that so?

138
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Please answer this.

139
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
What?

140
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
How big is the door of Megane-saru's glasses?

141
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Have you ever seen Megane-saru?

142
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I have.

143
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
It's not like he has glasses on.

144
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
What do you mean?

145
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Megane-saru doesn't have glasses on.

146
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Then what do you think that is?

147
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
It looks like that.

148
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
It looks like he has glasses on.

149
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Why?

150
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Megane-saru doesn't have glasses on.

151
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
No, no, no.

152
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I've never seen him like this.

153
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
No, no, no.

154
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
You're a fool.

155
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
You're a fool.

156
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
What?

157
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Megane-saru at the beginning was like this.

158
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
What do you mean by that?

159
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
He was like this.

160
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
He was like this.

161
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
It's not like he had a long neck.

162
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
That's true.

163
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
It's the same as that.

164
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Megane-saru was like this at the beginning.

165
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
It's gradually evolving.

166
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
It's becoming more and more annoying.

167
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:32,000
It's gradually becoming a sports type.

168
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
It's becoming natural.

169
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Or it's like this now.

170
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
It's changing like that.

171
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:47,000
The one who does this now is a very old type.

172
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Why do you call him Megane-saru?

173
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
What do you mean?

174
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I don't know what you mean.

175
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
He doesn't have glasses on.

176
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
He doesn't have glasses on.

177
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
He's the old type.

178
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
The old one was like this.

179
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
The new one is like this.

180
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
He doesn't have glasses on.

181
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Touch him.

182
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Touch Megane-saru.

183
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
What an amazing lens.

184
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
You can tell if he's wearing a lens.

185
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
You can tell even if you don't touch him.

186
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Megane-saru can't tell at night.

187
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
He can't see at night.

188
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
He can't see in the daytime.

189
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Megane-saru can't see from the front.

190
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Because it's a flat lens.

191
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
When he does this, he glows.

192
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
He's not wearing glasses.

193
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
He's not wearing glasses.

194
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
He does.

195
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
It depends on the type of person.

196
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
That's true.

197
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
That's true.

198
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
If he's wearing glasses.

199
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I don't know.

200
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
He's not wearing glasses.

201
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Where did you see Megane-saru?

202
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
There's a statue of Megane-saru.

203
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I saw him at the zoo.

204
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
A statue is cool.

205
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Why did you touch him?

206
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I saw Megane-saru at the zoo.

207
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Megane-saru at the zoo is a lie.

208
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
What do you mean by a lie?

209
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Don't think the lion at the zoo is a lion.

210
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
He's a lion.

211
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:25,000
He's not going to be a prey anymore since he's been in the cage.

212
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
You don't need a cage.

213
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
The lion is a lion.

214
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Megane-saru is at the zoo.

215
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
So he's not wearing glasses.

216
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
But he's wearing glasses in the jungle.

217
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I don't understand why he's not wearing glasses.

218
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Why?

219
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
He's not wearing glasses since he was born.

220
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
If he was wearing glasses, it would be a show.

221
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Glasses are glasses.

222
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Where did you get those glasses?

223
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
This is from my mother.

224
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Your mother?

225
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Your mother is also a monkey?

226
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
My mother is also a monkey.

227
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Where did you get those glasses?

228
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I took them from her.

229
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
You took them from her?

230
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
You took them from a human, didn't you?

231
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
You took them from a human?

232
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
You took them from a human, didn't you?

233
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
You are a monkey.

234
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I took them from a monkey.

235
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
You are a monkey.

236
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
You took them from a monkey, didn't you?

237
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Your mother took them from you and put them on you.

238
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
At first, I didn't like it.

239
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Glasses are glasses.

240
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Glasses are all glasses.

241
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Glasses are all glasses.

242
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Why? You just took them from her and put them on.

243
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
That's right.

244
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
At first, I didn't like it.

245
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
But gradually, I started to like it.

246
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Do you understand?

247
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Yes.

248
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Matsumoto-san had a fight with a snowman in the middle of his trip to Everest.

249
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
How did you settle this?

250
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
This is a great story.

251
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I want to hear it.

252
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I want to hear it.

253
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
How much percent do you want to hear it?

254
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Please express it in numbers.

255
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
How much percent do you want to hear it?

256
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
How much percent did you want to hear the story about the glasses?

257
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
50 percent.

258
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
That's why it was like that.

259
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
How much percent this time?

260
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
100 percent.

261
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
On the contrary, I don't talk to people who want to hear it that much.

262
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
If you tell me, I'll be happy.

263
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
You're looking forward to it too much.

264
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I see.

265
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
That was hard.

266
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
First of all, I didn't go to Everest on the way to Tokyo.

267
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I don't care about that.

268
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I don't care about that.

269
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I'm glad I met you on the way to Everest.

270
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Before the special meeting, I want to ask you first.

271
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
What kind of guy is the snowman?

272
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
What kind of guy is the snowman?

273
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I want you to tell me what he looks like.

274
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Everyone misunderstands the snowman.

275
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Actually, he's about this big.

276
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
In our imagination, it's like a big guy.

277
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
You think it's big, right?

278
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
But it's all snow around, so it looks big.

279
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
There's no object.

280
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I've never seen a snowman with a cigarette.

281
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
If he had a cigarette, he'd be like this.

282
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
A cigarette.

283
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
A cigarette?

284
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:46,000
It's a pure white world, so it looks big.

285
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
How big are you?

286
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I'm about this big.

287
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
What does he look like?

288
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
He's small.

289
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
What does he look like?

290
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I don't know what he looks like, but he has long hair.

291
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
He has a beard.

292
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
That's what he looks like.

293
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
He has the same eyes as you.

294
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
He has the same eyes as you.

295
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
He has a clean face.

296
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
He's small, but he's cute.

297
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
He has a clean face.

298
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Amazing.

299
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I was climbing up Everest.

300
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Elevator?

301
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
When I was climbing up Everest,

302
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
at the beginning,

303
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
at the bottom,

304
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
the climbers would say,

305
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Hello.

306
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
That's not the Everest.

307
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
That's not the Mt. Fuji.

308
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
That's not it.

309
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
At Everest,

310
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
at the bottom,

311
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
there are hikers.

312
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
They say, Hello.

313
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
At that moment,

314
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I was climbing to the top of Everest.

315
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I was climbing to the top of Everest.

316
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
It was an elevator.

317
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Right?

318
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I thought a child was coming,

319
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
so I said, Hello.

320
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Then, the climber came.

321
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I said, Did you climb up?

322
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
It was a snowman.

323
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Why did you do that?

324
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I don't know.

325
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Why do you think he's a snowman?

326
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
You thought he was just a child, didn't you?

327
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
What?

328
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
You thought he was just a child, didn't you?

329
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
That's why the climber is a snowman.

330
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Is that so?

331
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
He's amazing.

332
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
He's hairy?

333
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
He's really hairy.

334
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
This was scary.

335
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I've never heard this story before.

336
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
But it's about this, right?

337
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
You can win even if you're a top climber.

338
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Why?

339
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Why?

340
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
You have a cute face.

341
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Your face is ugly.

342
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
You're kicking the snowman.

343
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
You don't look at anything else.

344
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
You're only looking at the snowman.

345
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
You're like this.

346
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
You're like this.

347
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
If you're only kicking the snowman,

348
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
you can protect the snowman.

349
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
But he's just kicking the snowman.

350
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I'm scared.

351
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
You're crazy.

352
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I'm not crazy.

353
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
If you kick the snowman,

354
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
you can stop it with your hands or legs.

355
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
That's not true.

356
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I'm used to kicking the snowman.

357
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Even if I kick the snowman,

358
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
it comes off.

359
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
This is really scary.

360
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
You kicked the snowman, didn't you?

361
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
How did you deal with it?

362
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
You kicked the snowman many times.

363
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
That's right.

364
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
How did you deal with it?

365
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I had a girlfriend.

366
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I had a girlfriend.

367
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Even though you didn't have a girlfriend?

368
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I stopped it with my hands.

369
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
The judgment is amazing.

370
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
It's fast.

371
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I know you kicked the snowman.

372
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
How did you deal with it?

373
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
That's the question.

374
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
It's a story of a showman.

375
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
That's right.

376
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I've never heard of you kicking the snowman.

377
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I want you to tell me how to deal with it.

378
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I can't fight

379
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
against

380
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
the snowman

381
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
underwater.

382
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I see.

383
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
You're used to it.

384
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I'm used to it.

385
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I'm controlling the snow.

386
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I'm controlling the Everest.

387
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
That little thing.

388
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I can't win if I fight there.

389
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I can't bring it to my field.

390
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I see.

391
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Before I say anything,

392
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I put it in my rucksack.

393
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
By the way,

394
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I've already won.

395
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I kicked the snowman until now.

396
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I caught it and put it in my rucksack.

397
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
It's over.

398
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I kicked it out of my rucksack pocket.

399
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
It's amazing.

400
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
You can kick it with that.

401
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,000
You can kick it with that.

402
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I don't understand why

403
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
you kick the snowman.

404
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I can't do anything

405
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
if I take it to a warm place.

406
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I'm sorry.

407
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I'm sorry.

408
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Apologize.

409
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I'm sleepy.

410
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I'm sleepy.

411
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I'm very sleepy.

412
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I'm very sleepy.

413
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I often see a child

414
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
on the rear glass of a car.

415
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I often see a child on the rear glass of a car.

416
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
What does that mean?

417
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
What does that mean?

418
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I always look at it and think,

419
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
What does that mean?

420
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I always look at it and think,

421
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
What does that mean?

422
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
A child is riding.

423
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
A child is riding.

424
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
So?

425
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
So?

426
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
If a child is driving,

427
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I understand.

428
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
If a child is driving,

429
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I understand.

430
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
If a child is driving,

431
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I understand.

432
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
If a child is driving,

433
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I understand.

434
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
What's the reason?

435
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
What's the reason?

436
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
What's the reason?

437
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I don't think you should drive too fast.

438
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
So don't get on my back.

439
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Don't get on my back.

440
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I hate the idea that

441
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I don't care about the child.

442
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I hate the idea that

443
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I don't care about the child.

444
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
It doesn't matter.

445
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I see.

446
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
You have to treat children like adults.

447
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
That might be the case, but it's just that...

448
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
There was a time when Miyasako gave birth to a child.

449
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Yes, yes.

450
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
She gave birth to a child, right?

451
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
She said, please come see it.

452
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
It's only been a few months, so it's been like this the whole time.

453
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Right?

454
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Everyone, Yo-san's juniors also came and said,

455
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Wow, it's so cute.

456
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
But it's not cute at all.

457
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
What the hell?

458
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I asked her, what are you doing?

459
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
She said, please sit on the veranda.

460
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
She said, there's a bride.

461
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
What kind of image is that?

462
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
You didn't do anything like that, did you?

463
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Why do I have to sit on the veranda for Miyasako's baby?

464
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
That's a stupid movie.

465
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Well, I thought I'd watch it.

466
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I watched it, but there's nothing to say.

467
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Everyone says that the eyes are similar.

468
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Isn't that all a lie?

469
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
It doesn't look like that.

470
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I don't know if it's grown a little bit, but it doesn't look like it in two or three months.

471
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Well, I don't know that.

472
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Miyasako's baby doesn't look like it, so it doesn't really work.

473
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
I looked at it and I didn't have a place to praise it.

474
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
There's a chick app here.

475
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
It's more yellow than I thought.

476
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
It's got a cute face.

477
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
It's yellow.

478
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Miyasako, that's a chick app.

479
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Is that so?

480
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I thought the bride must be laughing.

481
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I looked at it and it was like this.

482
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
That's not true.

483
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
It's a bad image.

484
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Where are you looking?

485
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I don't know. Ask your wife.

486
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Matsumoto and Hamada can't win over the history of the 12-year-old servant.

487
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:50,000
It's a battle and punishment game where Matsumoto and Hamada compete with each other.

488
00:19:50,000 --> 00:20:13,000
And this year, the Matsumoto vs. Hamada team's 50-meter race to mark a new century has begun.

489
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
The Hamada team won this match.

490
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Matsumoto lost to Muzan.

491
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Therefore, the punishment game has been decided for the first time in seven years.

492
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:28,000
The other day, a talk was held between the Hamada team about the punishment game.

493
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,000
The last time we were here, it was so bad.

494
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
It was terrible.

495
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
It was beyond the punishment game.

496
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
It was beyond the punishment game.

497
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
That's right.

498
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,000
It was mentally and physically painful.

499
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
I can't work at 2 or 3 o'clock.

500
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
This is the worst punishment game ever.

501
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
It's a 24-hour long game of tag.

502
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
The four of them are trapped in a secret gym.

503
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
The four of them are trapped in a secret gym.

504
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
No!

505
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
No!

506
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
No!

507
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:21,000
The four of them have experienced the worst humiliation ever since they started their lives.

508
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,000
I want you to do the same thing as before.

509
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I want you to play 24-hour tag.

510
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Only if you get beaten.

511
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
I'll definitely get caught.

512
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
I'll definitely get caught.

513
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I wonder if the target is Matsumoto.

514
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I can't escape.

515
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Only if you get beaten.

516
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
But...

517
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Skydiving...

518
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Even if it's Fujiyama.

519
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Even if it's Fujiyama.

520
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I'd like to take you there, but I can't.

521
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
That's 24-hour Fujiyama, isn't it?

522
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
But...

523
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
That's 24-hour Fujiyama, isn't it?

524
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
24-hour Fujiyama, or 24-hour skydiving.

525
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
If you get off, you still have to ride.

526
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,000
If we were to go, we'd have to ride for 24 hours.

527
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
If we were to go, we'd have to ride for 24 hours.

528
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
That's very...

529
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
That's very...

530
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
I think it's okay to go higher.

531
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Really?

532
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
I think it's okay to go higher.

533
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
48 hours.

534
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
48 hours.

535
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
That was that hard.

536
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
I can say that.

537
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Remember the bus game in Yamasaki?

538
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
It wasn't broken, was it?

539
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
It was abandoned.

540
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
It was abandoned.

541
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
We played it.

542
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
That was hard, wasn't it?

543
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
That was hard.

544
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
It was scary.

545
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
It was scary.

546
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:37,000
It was scary.

547
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
What's going on?

548
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
What are you doing?

549
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
If we were to go for 24 hours, we'd have to come in the afternoon.

550
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Ah, I see.

551
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
It wasn't scary.

552
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
It was scary in the dark.

553
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
If you go up, you play Seeing buses.

554
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
You play Majesty buses.

555
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
