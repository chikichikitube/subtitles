1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,300
Today, we're going to hang out with everyone.

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:05,400
That's right!

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:08,800
Well, to hang out, we need this thing, right?

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,500
That's right.

5
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:15,400
Well, that's just a common person's story.

6
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:22,800
When you become a star like us, you don't need money when you hang out.

7
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,900
Don't we actually have money?

8
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,400
We don't.

9
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,600
Well, we only need one photo.

10
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,200
You're going to take one?

11
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:35,000
If you're going to hang out with us, you don't need money.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,700
You don't need money?

13
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:38,300
With my face.

14
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:39,000
With your face?

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:39,800
With my face.

16
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,800
Wow!

17
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,400
That's why you're rich!

18
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,200
You're so stingy!

19
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,900
That's why you're rich!

20
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:49,700
Really?

21
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:50,200
Really?

22
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,800
Then, let's have a drink.

23
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,400
You know, Suga-chan told me not to say anything.

24
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,000
He gave me 10,000 yen.

25
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,400
But I don't have any.

26
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:03,200
I think I'm the only one who's a star.

27
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:06,400
Oh, you have a star, Yoh.

28
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,300
I only have Orimomasawa left.

29
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:12,100
Stop it!

30
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:14,100
That's a camera.

31
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:16,700
That's a camera.

32
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:22,000
This program is brought to you by these sponsors.

33
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Hey, you're going to give us a ride, right?

34
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:24,900
What?

35
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:26,800
What's going on?

36
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,200
Do you know that we're going to ride?

37
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,300
Yeah.

38
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:31,800
Wow!

39
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:32,600
Where should we go?

40
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:33,900
Where should we go?

41
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:37,200
There's a lot of traffic on this road.

42
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,300
Should we take the expressway?

43
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:41,000
The expressway is free.

44
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:41,500
What?

45
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:44,000
Yeah, the expressway is free.

46
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,200
That's why I'm sitting here.

47
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,900
I can't show my face.

48
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,300
You can't show your face?

49
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:50,600
Yeah.

50
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,700
It's free.

51
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:52,300
I can't show my face.

52
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:53,000
You can't show your face?

53
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,500
Yeah.

54
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,600
This is the entrance, right?

55
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,500
Yeah, this is the entrance.

56
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,600
Let's go.

57
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,600
We can see it.

58
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,000
Oh, I saw it.

59
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,400
I saw it.

60
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,000
Hello, downtown.

61
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,300
Oh, hello.

62
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:07,700
I saw your face somewhere.

63
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:08,200
May I?

64
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:08,900
No, you can't.

65
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:10,700
I'll give you 700 yen.

66
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:11,700
700 yen?

67
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:12,200
Yes.

68
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:12,800
Here you go.

69
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,400
Do you want to take a picture?

70
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,400
Yeah, please.

71
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,500
Wait a minute.

72
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,400
Mr. Matsumoto, Mr. Hama.

73
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,200
What?

74
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,200
Something's wrong.

75
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:18,900
He said no.

76
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:21,400
Maybe he's a new member.

77
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,200
Oh, hello.

78
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,100
I'm sorry.

79
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:24,100
Mr. Matsumoto, are you a new member?

80
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:25,600
Let's go.

81
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,900
Hello.

82
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:28,600
What's wrong with you?

83
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,500
Are you a new member?

84
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:30,800
He said it was ridiculous.

85
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,100
And he said no.

86
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,500
He said no.

87
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,300
That was fast.

88
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:36,200
What's wrong with you?

89
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,800
What's wrong with you?

90
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,200
You know what?

91
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,500
I don't know what's funny.

92
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:44,000
What's funny?

93
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,800
He's serious.

94
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,800
Let's get off.

95
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,100
What?

96
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:49,000
Let's get off.

97
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,800
Are we getting off?

98
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,500
Are you serious?

99
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,100
If we get on now, we'll be in trouble.

100
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:54,100
Let's get off.

101
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:55,000
Are we really getting off?

102
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,100
We'll be in trouble.

103
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:57,400
Yeah.

104
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,500
I'm hungry.

105
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,700
I'm hungry.

106
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,900
I don't mind.

107
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:07,500
Oh, there's a YOSHINOYA.

108
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,500
Are we going there?

109
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,600
Let's go.

110
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,400
There's no YOSHINOYA?

111
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,500
No.

112
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,400
There's no YOSHINOYA.

113
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,800
Oh, really?

114
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,900
Why do you want to go there?

115
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:20,200
I don't want to go.

116
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,300
Okay.

117
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,300
Excuse me.

118
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:23,900
Let's eat.

119
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:24,900
Let's eat.

120
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:25,800
Let's eat.

121
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,300
Okay.

122
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:34,100
Thank you.

123
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:35,800
I'm full.

124
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,100
I'm full.

125
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:39,300
Excuse me.

126
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:39,800
Okay.

127
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,900
Excuse me.

128
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:41,800
Thank you.

129
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,300
Thank you.

130
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,100
Excuse me.

131
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:44,700
Let's go.

132
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:47,100
Okay.

133
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:50,300
Thank you.

134
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:52,500
That's amazing.

135
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,900
That's amazing.

136
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57,100
That's amazing.

137
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,100
That's amazing.

138
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:00,200
That's amazing.

139
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,400
No one's coming, right?

140
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,400
No one's coming, right?

141
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,200
No one's coming, right?

142
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,000
No one's coming, right?

143
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Let's go.

144
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,700
Let's go.

145
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:08,600
Let's play.

146
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,300
Let's play.

147
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,100
This is amazing.

148
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,500
We can play anything.

149
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:15,800
If it was a nightclub, we'd go get some air.

150
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,900
Yeah.

151
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:17,700
Can we get some air?

152
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:18,800
Everyone's catching a cold.

153
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,500
Oh, really?

154
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,700
There's a nightclub on the side of the wagon.

155
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:24,000
Oh, there is.

156
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
A nightclub on the side of the wagon?

157
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,100
Is this a place to catch a cold?

158
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:34,700
Can I have some Isojin?

159
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:36,400
Isojin?

160
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,100
Can I have some Isojin?

161
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:39,000
Isojin?

162
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,300
Can I have some Isojin?

163
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:41,100
Can I have some Isojin?

164
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:44,100
Can I have some Isojin?

165
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,500
Oh, really?

166
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,200
Can I have some Isojin?

167
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:47,900
Can I have some Isojin?

168
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,600
This is really good.

169
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,400
Is it?

170
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,200
You can take pictures.

171
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,400
Can I have two of these?

172
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,900
Yes.

173
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,400
How much is this?

174
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,200
This is 2,800 yen.

175
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,400
If you're in trouble, you can take it.

176
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,500
Thank you very much.

177
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,300
Thank you.

178
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:06,400
Are you going to pay for the ingredients?

179
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,200
Are you going to pay for the ingredients?

180
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,200
What?

181
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:10,800
Are you going to pay for the ingredients?

182
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,200
Are you going to pay for the ingredients?

183
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,500
Hamada's going to tell you.

184
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,400
He's going to tell you.

185
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,200
Oh, really?

186
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,900
You guys don't have to come anymore.

187
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,700
We're leaving.

188
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:21,000
You don't have to come anymore.

189
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,900
Let's go.

190
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:23,900
How much is it?

191
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,600
8,850 yen.

192
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,600
8,850 yen.

193
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,300
9,000 yen.

194
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:31,200
Yes.

195
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,400
9,000 yen.

196
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,200
Are you okay?

197
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:33,800
I'm okay.

198
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:37,200
Mom, don't talk to me.

199
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,900
You guys drank a lot, didn't you?

200
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:39,800
Yes.

201
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,300
That's why we're here.

202
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:42,500
It's just for you.

203
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,200
That's right.

204
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,500
Do you still have your wallet?

205
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,900
I have it, but...

206
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:48,400
Oh, really?

207
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,500
Yes.

208
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,200
But you didn't need it, did you?

209
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:53,700
Yes.

210
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:54,100
What?

211
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,500
You didn't need it, did you?

212
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,500
Well, basically.

213
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,000
That's right. It has nothing to do with us.

214
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,200
Anyway, you have your wallet, right?

215
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:05,100
I have it.

216
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,800
Well, we don't have to go anywhere.

217
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,700
Shall we put gasoline in?

218
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:09,500
Let's put gasoline in.

219
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,200
That's right.

220
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,100
It's dangerous.

221
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:19,700
Okay, let's put it in here.

222
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:20,400
Hello.

223
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,500
Yes, we have gas and regular.

224
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,200
Regular.

225
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:23,800
Is it a full tank?

226
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,400
Yes.

227
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,200
Do you have a number?

228
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:25,800
No.

229
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,200
Is it cash?

230
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:26,700
Yes.

231
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,600
Well, it's cash.

232
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,100
Yes.

233
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,600
Well, it's cash.

234
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,500
Well, it's cash.

235
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,100
You can't treat it like cash.

236
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:38,800
Oh, it's cash.

237
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,600
It's a receipt.

238
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,600
Is that so?

239
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,400
Yes, it's cash.

240
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,900
Well, we can't treat it like cash.

241
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,900
It'll be 4,112 yen.

242
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:52,500
Yes.

243
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,900
Mr. Hamada.

244
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:57,100
I have something to tell you.

245
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,700
It'll be 4,112 yen.

246
00:06:58,700 --> 00:06:59,300
Oh, really?

247
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:00,000
Yes.

248
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,500
Mr. Hamada, can I see your wallet?

249
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,100
What are you looking at?

250
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,700
Can I see your wallet?

251
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:09,300
You want me to show it to you?

252
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,000
You want me to show it to you?

253
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,900
Give it to me.

254
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,000
Give it to me.

255
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,400
No, no.

256
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,100
What is it?

257
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:15,700
Mr. Hamada.

258
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:16,200
Excuse me.

259
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:16,900
Wait, wait, wait.

260
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:17,400
Mr. Hamada.

261
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,300
What do you want to do?

262
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,000
Can I see your wallet?

263
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,100
Yes, yes.

264
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,500
Isn't it free?

265
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,000
No.

266
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,300
I don't want it anymore.

267
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:24,300
It's free, isn't it?

268
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:24,900
I don't want it.

269
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:25,700
Please.

270
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:26,600
I don't want it.

271
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,400
It's free, isn't it?

272
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,200
Yes, yes.

273
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,500
Well, it's 5,650 yen.

274
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,300
It's my credit card.

275
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:30,900
Thank you.

276
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,300
Thank you very much.

277
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:33,900
See you later, Yone-chan.

278
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:34,400
Yes.

279
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,400
When did you meet Yone-chan?

280
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,000
It was definitely Yone-chan.

281
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,300
Yes.

282
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:40,400
It was definitely Yone-chan.

283
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,800
It was definitely Yone-chan.

284
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,800
What is this?

285
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,800
Mr. Hamada.

286
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,800
Mr. Hamada.

287
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,100
This is really.

288
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,100
What is it?

289
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:52,000
You said it was free before, didn't you?

290
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,800
It's not free at all.

291
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,500
It's not free at all.

292
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,000
What?

293
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
What did you just say?

294
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:58,700
Mr. Hamada, what did you just say?

295
00:07:58,700 --> 00:07:59,600
What did you just say?

296
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,300
What did you just say?

297
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:02,500
It's free.

298
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:02,900
What are you going to do?

299
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,700
Do you want to have some tea?

300
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:05,400
Yes.

301
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,800
To refresh your mind.

302
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,100
Can you go for free?

303
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,500
To refresh your mind.

304
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,000
I'd like to have some tea.

305
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,700
I'd like to have some tea.

306
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,100
Where is this place?

307
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:14,800
This place is.

308
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,800
Kamikitazawa.

309
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,900
I see.

310
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:18,900
That's right.

311
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:25,400
Yahatayama.

312
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,400
Yahatayama.

313
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,800
Isn't this Hachiman Yamato-chan?

314
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:33,500
Endo.

315
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,400
Endo.

316
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,900
Yes.

317
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:39,600
Don't talk too much.

318
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,600
Don't show your stupidity.

319
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:50,300
The fish shop is free.

320
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,700
It's a great place.

321
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:55,400
I was calculating the price.

322
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,100
You were calculating the price?

323
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:56,600
You were calculating the price?

324
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,700
Yes. You were calculating the price?

325
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:00,300
It's 8,000 yen.

326
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:01,000
You were calculating the price?

327
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
You were calculating the price?

328
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Are you okay?

329
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,900
Are you okay?

330
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:05,900
Let's go to the toilet.

331
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,900
Okay.

332
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,700
This is Matagose-san.

333
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:35,000
This is Matagose-san.

334
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Hey, wait.

335
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,500
Hey, wait.

336
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:42,700
Hey, wait.

337
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:44,700
Hey.

338
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,100
Hey, give it to me.

339
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:46,600
Hey.

340
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,200
Hey, wait.

341
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,100
You're a thief.

342
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:49,900
What?

343
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,600
What?

344
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,800
Please look at Yamada-san's face.

345
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,500
Please look at Yamada-san's face.

346
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,200
Why?

347
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,900
Why are you paying?

348
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,800
I'm paying you.

349
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,800
How much is it?

350
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,100
3,000 yen.

351
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,400
3,000 yen?

352
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,400
Why did you do that?

353
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,200
Don't call me.

354
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,200
Don't you have anything to pay?

355
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,700
I don't have anything to pay.

356
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,700
What's wrong with you?

357
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:23,700
I'm sorry.

358
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:24,700
What are you talking about?

359
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:25,900
I'm sorry.

360
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:28,300
I have 9,000 yen left.

361
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:29,200
I'm sorry.

362
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:29,900
9,000 yen.

363
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,800
9,300 yen.

364
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,200
Idiot.

365
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,700
Idiot?

366
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,900
There's nothing to be idiotic about.

367
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:39,200
What are you talking about?

368
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,100
You guys are crazy.

369
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,800
You're young.

370
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,700
It's all for free.

371
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:48,000
It's all for free.

372
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,300
Leave it to me.

373
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,700
I'll leave it to you.

374
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,100
Take me with you next time.

375
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,900
I can't.

376
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:54,600
I can't.

377
00:10:54,600 --> 00:11:05,100
Take me with you next time.

378
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,700
Excuse me.

379
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:10,300
You forgot your cigarettes.

380
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:11,500
I'm sorry.

381
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,800
Thank you.

382
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,100
By the way,

383
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,700
I didn't get the question earlier.

384
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:17,700
Oh.

385
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:18,600
Oh.

386
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,900
He left.

387
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:21,500
Oh.

388
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,300
I'm sorry.

389
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:23,700
Yamazaki.

390
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,900
Idiot.

391
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:28,600
Why did you take my cigarettes?

392
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,700
I'm sorry.

393
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:31,700
How much is it?

394
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,800
5,160 yen.

395
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:34,900
I'm sorry.

396
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,100
Here you go.

397
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:37,700
Here's 10,000 yen.

398
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:38,500
Thank you.

399
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,900
Thank you.

400
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:40,600
I'm sorry.

401
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,500
I'm sorry.

402
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:44,900
Here you go.

403
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,700
What do you mean?

404
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:48,500
You're saying it's all for free, right?

405
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,300
You're saying it's all for free, right?

406
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:56,700
I'll pay for it.

407
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,100
He said it's all for free.

408
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,100
I'll pay for it.

409
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:03,300
I'll pay for it.

410
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:04,800
It's impossible, right?

411
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,100
We're the same, right?

412
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,700
That's enough.

413
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:12,400
If you say more, I'll have to close it with a bottle cap.

414
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:15,700
Idiot.

415
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,100
Yamazaki.

416
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,700
You're so stupid.

417
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:21,600
You're so stupid.

418
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,100
You're so stupid.

419
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:33,300
Like this?

420
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:35,800
What should I say?

421
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:39,100
Everyone is fine, but I'm in trouble.

422
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:39,600
Why?

423
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:45,800
It's been a while since I caught a cold.

424
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:48,700
I caught a cold.

425
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:49,900
Did you take medicine?

426
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:53,100
I did, but it's been a long time.

427
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:56,900
You should see a doctor.

428
00:12:56,900 --> 00:13:00,100
I can't see a doctor right now.

429
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:03,500
I don't get a fever.

430
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,900
Even if I catch a cold.

431
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:05,400
Really?

432
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:09,700
But I'm a little girl.

433
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:12,900
I'm a little girl.

434
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:14,300
What kind of girl?

435
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:17,600
The first thing I can't forgive is the nosebleed.

436
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,100
I see.

437
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:21,300
What's with the nosebleed?

438
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:24,500
I can't sleep at night.

439
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,300
If I get a cold, I turn around and sleep.

440
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:29,000
That nosebleed is funny.

441
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,100
What kind of human body is this?

442
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:34,300
You like it, don't you?

443
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:38,300
Are you Japanese?

444
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:39,300
No, no.

445
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:41,100
I'll change the word.

446
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:43,400
We're not Japanese anymore.

447
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:46,100
It's getting worse.

448
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:49,100
It's getting worse, isn't it?

449
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,900
It's hard to catch a cold.

450
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:58,100
You can see the nosebleed, but you shouldn't be in a hurry.

451
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:02,000
After a while, you have to measure the distance with your mouth.

452
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,100
You have to keep the nosebleed.

453
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:11,900
If you do this, the nosebleed will go away.

454
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,400
I think it's okay.

455
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:20,900
After a while, it's like an order stop.

456
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:22,900
It's like, are you ready?

457
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:25,500
You still have to measure the distance with your mouth.

458
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,500
You have to repeat it until you get a cold.

459
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,300
Until I get a cold?

460
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,100
Yes.

461
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:32,500
I'm so angry.

462
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,200
It's not a cold.

463
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:37,700
You have to drill a hole here.

464
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:38,700
I don't want to drill a hole.

465
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:42,100
But don't say anything to me.

466
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:42,600
What do you mean?

467
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,500
Don't say something weird.

468
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,300
Weird?

469
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:47,900
What? A hole?

470
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:52,300
That's fine, but you say something weird here.

471
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:53,600
I don't like that.

472
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,300
Oh, I see.

473
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:57,700
But you only say it at that moment.

474
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:59,800
It's weird for a girl to drill a hole.

475
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:02,400
It's not that bad.

476
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:07,000
Sometimes, I put something that I made and dyed my skin here.

477
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,200
Oh, you shouldn't do that.

478
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,700
If you do that, I'll say it.

479
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:11,300
That's weird.

480
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:12,900
I don't like that.

481
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,900
You don't like that?

482
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:19,000
Oh, I remember!

483
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,200
Yesterday was my day!

484
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:25,000
Why did you turn on the TV?

485
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:30,200
I told you to go to the police station!

486
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:35,200
You stupid bastard!

487
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,400
Wait a minute!

488
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:40,900
I rarely watch TV.

489
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:44,800
There was something like a notice.

490
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:49,500
I don't know what it was, but I turned it on, and you came out as a couple.

491
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,500
What are you guys?

492
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:54,700
Did they give you something by swapping?

493
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:59,400
It's the duty of the people.

494
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,700
I'll become a couple with you.

495
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:02,000
Why?

496
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:02,900
You won't.

497
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:05,200
You don't know what it is.

498
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:12,600
I don't know what it is.

499
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:15,700
You should have told me earlier!

500
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:18,300
You should have told me earlier!

501
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:21,300
You should have told me earlier!

502
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:23,400
I heard that a lot of people died this year.

503
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:23,900
Oh, really?

504
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,700
I have a preventive injection.

505
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:26,900
That's right.

506
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:30,000
You really do that.

507
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,400
You really do that.

508
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:35,200
Then why didn't you go to the hospital?

509
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:40,800
You should have told me earlier!

510
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:44,200
You only care about yourself.

511
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:50,800
So why didn't I tell you that I was going to give you a preventive injection?

512
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:55,200
I didn't tell you, but I did give you a preventive injection.

513
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:58,800
Machan.

514
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:02,200
Machan is from Hamachaya.

515
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:05,200
I gave you a preventive injection, but why didn't you give it to me?

516
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,900
Why are you so kind?

517
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:09,300
I don't know.

518
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:12,500
If it were me, I would have told you.

519
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,500
Why?

520
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:20,400
If there's something delicious, I'll wrap it in a tissue and give it to you.

521
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,900
You've never given it to me before.

522
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:26,900
I haven't met any delicious sweets before, but if there is, I'll give it to you.

523
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:34,200
It seems like you have a lot of fever.

524
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,600
It's fine.

525
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,100
Why?

526
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:39,100
You don't have to worry about it.

527
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:42,900
You're really...

528
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,400
You're really sad.

529
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,900
What do you want to say?

530
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,600
You make your own food, but you have a fever.

531
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,300
That's not true!

532
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:54,000
That's not true!

533
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,700
No matter what you do, you're alone.

534
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:01,400
What is that?

535
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,700
What song is that?

536
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:08,800
Don't make it into a song.

537
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,300
Do you want to hear the rest?

538
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:16,500
I think you should get married.

539
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,500
If you have a fan like this,

540
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:25,700
If you have a fan like this, I want to hear it more!

541
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:28,200
I want to show it to Yoh!

542
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,800
Yoh?

543
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:36,500
Did you hear the Japanese song?

544
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:40,300
It's a part of the song.

545
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:44,500
If you do it suddenly, without a notice,

546
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:47,700
I'll do it so that no one knows.

547
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:52,500
Are you going to die?

548
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:55,500
I'm working, so I'll get caught.

549
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,300
You're going to tell no one?

550
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,500
No, no, no.

551
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:03,000
I'll just put it in my seat and do it.

552
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,700
Don't get excited!

553
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:11,400
Say no!

554
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,800
Every summer, for the children in the city,

555
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:18,400
If you catch insects in the mountains,

556
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:22,100
On a sleepless night, in the concrete jungle of the city,

557
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:25,200
I have a question for Matsumoto-san.

558
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,500
What do insects do in the wild?

559
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:32,600
They're grinning.

560
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,300
Are you grinning?

561
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:35,800
Are you going to sleep?

562
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,900
Why are you half laughing?

563
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:39,100
You're a fool.

564
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:41,400
Please tell me that.

565
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,100
I've never heard you grin.

566
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:46,000
It doesn't matter if it's a fly or an insect.

567
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,700
It's his dream to become a fly.

568
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:52,700
It's his debut.

569
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:56,600
Tomorrow is his first concert.

570
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:59,500
If you do it, it's fine.

571
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,200
It doesn't matter if you do it later.

572
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,400
The tickets are sold out.

573
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,600
That's enough!

574
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,700
I'm coming.

575
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:06,800
Don't tell me.

576
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:10,700
I'm coming.

577
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:13,300
Your mom and dad are coming.

578
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:17,700
The manager is asking you to come.

579
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:20,000
That's...

580
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,100
I know. I totally understand.

581
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:25,000
That's right before it comes out.

582
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:33,100
What do you mean?

583
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:34,500
I don't understand.

584
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:38,300
For example, the condition of the fly is for about a week.

585
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:39,100
The condition of the fly?

586
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:42,300
For example.

587
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:44,500
The fly on the sixth day is grinning.

588
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,300
It's before his debut.

589
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:50,200
The fly on the first day is also grinning.

590
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:53,800
At that time, it wasn't grinning.

591
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:57,400
What are you doing at this time?

592
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:57,800
What?

593
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,000
What are you doing at this time?

594
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,700
I'm having a lesson.

595
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:02,900
What do you mean by a lesson?

596
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:04,700
In this case,

597
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:09,300
I'm having a lesson about the fly.

598
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:11,600
What is it?

599
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,300
I don't understand that.

600
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:15,600
I don't understand that.

601
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:20,300
Why don't you tell me the short part of the fly?

602
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:23,800
I want to go back to the beginning.

603
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:24,800
It's fine.

604
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:25,500
What is it?

605
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,200
I can answer anything.

606
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,600
What are you doing on the first day?

607
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,600
On the first day?

608
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:36,500
The first day is the word for the fly that came out from the countryside.

609
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,400
I see.

610
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,900
I see.

611
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:42,100
You're fixing the fly.

612
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:43,100
During the period of forced labor.

613
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:43,900
Sleepy.

614
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:49,200
Sleepy.

615
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,000
I'm doing it because it comes out.

616
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,300
Don't be stupid.

617
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:56,600
On the first day,

618
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,700
I'm fixing the fly.

619
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:58,600
You're fixing the fly.

620
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,600
Your cheeks are still red.

621
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,500
I see.

622
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:02,600
What about the second day?

623
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:03,400
What?

624
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,300
The second day?

625
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:06,100
What?

626
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:07,100
What is it?

627
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:09,400
You said you were going to take a bath the day before, right?

628
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,600
That's right.

629
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,100
You're saying, here, right?

630
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:17,900
I see.

631
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:19,700
Be careful.

632
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:20,900
I'm scared.

633
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:22,900
I'm scared.

634
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:24,700
That's right.

635
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:26,100
I don't understand that.

636
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:27,800
When it's night time,

637
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:28,900
you're saying, sleep.

638
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:29,900
Sleepy.

639
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:32,100
This is the first time I've been so sleepy.

640
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:36,000
I understand that.

641
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:36,800
I understand that.

642
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,100
The next day.

643
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:38,900
The second day.

644
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:39,400
The second day.

645
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,400
You wake up in the morning.

646
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,200
What are you going to do?

647
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,400
I have to go see the president.

648
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,500
I have to go see the president.

649
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:45,000
I see.

650
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,800
I have to go see the president.

651
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:49,200
The fly hasn't disappeared yet.

652
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,500
It's a lesson.

653
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:51,000
I see.

654
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
I have to go see the president.

655
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:54,900
I see.

656
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,500
From the second day,

657
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,800
you came out of the countryside yesterday.

658
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,200
From the second day, I came out of the countryside.

659
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,400
I'm taking a picture.

660
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,000
I see.

661
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,400
This is a good fly.

662
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,400
I see.

663
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:04,700
I see.

664
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:05,600
It's a chosen fly.

665
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,400
I'm sorry.

666
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,400
It's not good.

667
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,200
Who are you?

668
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,200
I have to do the choreography.

669
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:23,700
I see.

670
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:25,400
Hey, look at that.

671
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,900
It's really not good.

672
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:29,800
Hey, look at that.

673
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,800
The person who said it looks like a fly.

674
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,800
Change the words properly.

675
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:37,300
Yes.

676
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:37,800
Yes.

677
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,800
After that,

678
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,800
I was touched.

679
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,300
That's what happened.

680
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:48,300
The day before, you were smiling.

681
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:48,800
I see.

682
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:51,300
When the bell rang,

683
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:52,800
the audience stood up.

684
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:53,800
Until now,

685
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,800
that was the only thing that happened.

686
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:56,300
That's right.

687
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:58,300
When the curtain opened,

688
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:02,300
it was so beautiful.

689
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:07,300
What are you doing?

690
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:10,300
Go away.

691
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:11,300
Go away.

692
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:24,300
This program was sponsored by the following sponsors.
