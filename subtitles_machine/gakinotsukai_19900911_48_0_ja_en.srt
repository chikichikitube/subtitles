1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Keiro no Hi special with Jin-chan Baachan and Kakurenbo!

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Today we have 6 guests.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
First, we have our guest, Mr. Amikoshi!

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
If you hold it down a bit more, your thumb will break.

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
It's not broken yet.

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
It's flat!

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
It's soft!

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I haven't said anything strange yet.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Next, we have our guest, Mrs. Komori!

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I'll have her hide.

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Please don't call me Mrs. Komori when I'm hiding.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm still in love with you.

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm in love with you one-sidedly.

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
What about Mr. Amikoshi?

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Mr. Amikoshi doesn't call people who look like Mrs. Komori.

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Mrs. Komori doesn't call people who look like Mrs. Komori either.

17
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Let's be friends.

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I saw Mrs. Amikoshi's sad face for the first time.

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
We have 4 more guests today.

20
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Who is this person?

21
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Umekichi.

22
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,000
She appeared on this show before.

23
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
We named her Umekichi.

24
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Masumoto took her home on a rope.

25
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Umekichi took her to Osaka and talked to her.

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Now I'm here.

27
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I blow my whistle and she comes back.

28
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
What?

29
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
She gets angry.

30
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
We have 2 more guests today.

31
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
It's been a long time since I played hide-and-seek.

32
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I remember when I was little.

33
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Really?

34
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
See you later.

35
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I set everything up.

36
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
You don't know this.

37
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Really?

38
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I've been a veteran detective for 50 years.

39
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I couldn't do this.

40
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Really?

41
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
It took a long time to hide.

42
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
It's hard to move.

43
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
It's hard to move.

44
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
It's hard to move.

45
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I'll kick you.

46
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Let's go.

47
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Say you know.

48
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Are you kidding me?

49
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I don't think she's found yet.

50
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I think there's a strange light.

51
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I'll kick you.

52
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
She's at the station sometimes.

53
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I'll kick you.

54
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
There are 5 more guests.

55
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
5 more guests.

56
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
There are 5 more guests.

57
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
There are 5 more guests.

58
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
She doesn't want to do it.

59
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
She doesn't want to do it.

60
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
She's hiding, so she's keeping her voice down.

61
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
She's hiding, so she's keeping her voice down.

62
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
She can't laugh.

63
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Let's throw her out.

64
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Let's throw her out.

65
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
She's happy, so let's leave her alone.

66
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Let's do it already.

67
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I've been thinking.

68
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
If I gather the 7 grandpas and grandmas, I'll have a wish.

69
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
She's there.

70
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
She was there just now.

71
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Grandma!

72
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Grandma!

73
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Now, let's have a look.

74
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
What are you doing?

75
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Now, let's have a look.

76
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Grandma, I'm sorry.

77
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Please come out.

78
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Grandma, please come out.

79
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Are there three more people?

80
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Hamada.

81
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
What?

82
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
You passed.

83
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Really?

84
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
You passed.

85
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Really?

86
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Hey.

87
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Grandma, let's go to war.

88
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I found you.

89
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Hey, Utsuka.

90
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I found you.

91
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
What did you find?

92
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Are you ready?

93
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Are you ready?

94
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
What?

95
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:53,000
You didn't turn off the microphone.

96
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:59,000
This is very funny.

97
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
This is very funny.

98
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I want to go to the children's meeting today.

99
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Look at the air conditioner.

100
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
It's noisy.

101
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Because the volume is high.

102
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Because the microphone is noisy.

103
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I can't hear myself.

104
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
One more person.

105
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
This is a grandma.

106
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
This is a grandma.

107
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
What?

108
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Hamada, what do you do when you wake up in the morning?

109
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
What time is it?

110
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
It's really me.

111
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I can't believe it's a male toilet.

112
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,000
What are you doing?

113
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
You look like a model.

114
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Grandma.

115
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Grandma is a model.

116
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Hamada.

117
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
It stinks.

118
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Thank you very much.

119
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
100 years old.

120
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
It was interesting that you were in an unexpected place.

121
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I didn't expect you to be in a toilet.

122
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:28,000
But this is the first time I've been in a male toilet since I was born in 1981.

123
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
It was a little painful today.

124
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Please tell me more better.

125
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Thank you very much.

126
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
You'll be lucky.

127
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I'm sorry.

128
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I'm not good at it.

129
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Hey, Matsumoto.

130
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Come on.

131
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Have you all read it?

132
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I read it in downtown Kaishanbyo.

133
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I'm sorry to say this at the beginning of the program.

134
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I don't think you'll get away with it.

135
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Hey.

136
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:36,000
We were supposed to have a party this year.

137
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Matsumoto and Hamada are not friends.

138
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
They both said they didn't want to continue laughing.

139
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
If it's that good, I'll stop it.

140
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Hey.

141
00:08:50,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I'm really sorry.

142
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Can't you close the last one properly?

143
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Are you crying or laughing?

144
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
It hurts.

145
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:24,000
This was on the news in Osaka and Tokyo.

146
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

147
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,000
The front line of the masked reporter.

148
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,000
What are you talking about?

149
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
We were surprised.

150
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
If you had checked it, we would have disbanded.

151
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,000
It's true that they're not friends.

152
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I haven't told him yet.

153
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:02,000
About six years ago, I was so angry that I still can't forget it.

154
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
What did I do?

155
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I think it was when I was leaving the theater.

156
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:20,000
He stepped on my foot.

157
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
It hurt a lot.

158
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I thought I'd stop it from that time.

159
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
What are you talking about?

160
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
The way he wrote it was so funny.

161
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
We both laughed.

162
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
He wrote that he didn't want to do comedy.

163
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:47,000
He said he wanted to be a producer.

164
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Hamada didn't want to work at all.

165
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I want to play.

166
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Hamada wants to play, so he can't help it.

167
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
It's impossible to tell him to study and practice comedy.

168
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I'm happy to come to Tokyo, so I can't help it.

169
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
If I go to Roppongi, I'll be teased.

170
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I want to play.

171
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Who are you?

172
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Come out, the front line of the masked reporter.

173
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I want to be a producer.

174
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Hamada hasn't worked yet.

175
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I want to play.

176
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:37,000
The big company employee told us to be serious.

177
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Then we said,

178
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:48,000
We're selling.

179
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
That's what we said.

180
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
All the news is a lie.

181
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Will your wife get pregnant?

182
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Why don't you do it?

183
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I don't think so.

184
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Why did you hide the fact that you had a baby?

185
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I didn't hide it.

186
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I'm working anyway.

187
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I can't help it.

188
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I didn't hide it.

189
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I can't help it.

190
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Your wife will get pregnant.

191
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I'm playing with the audience.

192
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
That's why you have to be careful.

193
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I saw it on the news yesterday.

194
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
My girlfriend found out.

195
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I don't know who it is.

196
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I don't want to bother her.

197
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:10,000
But I have to be honest on this show.

198
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
That's right.

199
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I've been dating for about a year.

200
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:24,000
It's embarrassing to say it myself.

201
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:37,000
My car broke down.

202
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I don't want to date.

203
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I don't want to date.

204
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I don't want to date.

205
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
It's a lie.

206
00:13:53,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I was bullied in high school.

207
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:07,000
That's not true.

208
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
At that time, I knew the fear of writing

209
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
So, there was a quiet kid in the class

210
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Everyone was kind of a bad guy, but

211
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
There were about 5 of us, and we were like,

212
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Hey, what's up?

213
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
There was that kind of thing

214
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Hey, you, come over here

215
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
That's what he said when he got home

216
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I was like, oh, he bullied me

217
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I wrote it down in my notebook

218
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:42,000
First, Daredare-kun kicked me in the face

219
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Then, Matsumoto-kun kicked my wife a couple of times

220
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I wrote it all down, and I went to the library

221
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,000
What do you call this over here?

222
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Dekopin?

223
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
It's called Osaka Konpachi

224
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Even if you do this, you can't write Dekopin when you become a Kijin

225
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
The face...

226
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
The face?

227
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I'm so angry

228
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
If you become a Kijin, you can't write Dekaiji

229
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
No, no, no

230
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Let's go to the field

231
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Hello

232
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Let me introduce you

233
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Yamaoda Reiko-san

234
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
What do you like about her?

235
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
She's funny

236
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
She's cool

237
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
She's funny and cool

238
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Does that mean you can do anything to us?

239
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
You like her a lot, don't you?

240
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Even if you were to step on my father, would you be able to accept that?

241
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I wouldn't be able to accept that

242
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
You don't like that?

243
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,000
You don't understand how a man feels about a woman, right?

244
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,000
For example, if you have a favorite actress or singer, you want to do it, right?

245
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I want to do it

246
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
You want to do it, right?

247
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
You like Dandan, don't you?

248
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
You want to do it?

249
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Why do you want to do it?

250
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
That's a strange story

251
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
It's strange

252
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
You like her, don't you?

253
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Do it!

254
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Hey!

255
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Do it!

256
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I won't do it

257
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I won't do it, but I'll do it even if I have to

258
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Even if you have to bully me

259
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I'm sorry

260
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I'm sorry

261
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Let's go

262
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
It's hot

263
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
It's really hot here

264
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I can't stand it

265
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
It's really hot

266
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
The other day, I was walking and I saw your face

267
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
The sky is hot

268
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
When I touched it

269
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
It's really hot

270
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
It's really hot

271
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I can't stand it

272
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
It's really hot

273
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
It's hot

274
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I know what you're talking about

275
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
The other day, I was walking and I saw your face

276
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
When I touched it

277
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
It's really hot

278
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Now, the break is over

279
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Let's introduce the post

280
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
This is from Tokumekibo

281
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
The other day, I went to see my favorite Matsumoto

282
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I waited for about 30 minutes

283
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Matsumoto came

284
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I went to see Matsumoto

285
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Matsumoto had a very angry face

286
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I was a little scared

287
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Is it always like that? Please tell me

288
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I read it before

289
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Please take care of your fans

290
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
It's always like that

291
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I think he's going to clap

292
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Usually?

293
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Yes

294
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
He's walking like he's annoyed

295
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
But usually he doesn't walk with such a smile

296
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Smile?

297
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
He doesn't walk with a smile

298
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
I can't say that he's smiling

299
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
If he says something, I can't say anything

300
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,000
What if he comes with a gift and asks you to take it?

301
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
What do I do?

302
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
That's all

303
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
That's all

304
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
That's all you have to say, right?

305
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I can say thank you too

306
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
You can say it?

307
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
No, that's...

308
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
When you say thank you

309
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
What do you mean?

310
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Everyone think about it

311
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Thank you

312
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Think about it when you say thank you

313
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Thank you?

314
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
When you say thank you

315
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
When you do something unexpected

316
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Unexpectedly

317
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Thank you is when you say something unexpected

318
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
That's not it

319
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Even if you do something unexpected

320
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
If you do something for yourself

321
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Thank you

322
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
There are people who bring cigarettes, right?

323
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Yes

324
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
What do you do with them?

325
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
It's all the same

326
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Thank you

327
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Why do you carry a cigarette in your hand?

328
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
You smoke

329
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
No, no

330
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Rather, you smoke this and you...

331
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
No, I don't

332
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
You want to kill me

333
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Are you out of your mind?

334
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Did I say thank you?

335
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
You didn't

336
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
When I was doing radio in Osaka

337
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Someone came and said

338
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Downtown-san, Nainai-san, good evening

339
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Everyone said good evening

340
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Actually, I...

341
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I can't even say good evening

342
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
You can't

343
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Why?

344
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Everyone is thinking about greetings

345
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Greetings

346
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Wait, you

347
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
You can't even say thank you

348
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
If you say this

349
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
You can't even say thank you

350
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Greetings

351
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
You say it while looking at people's eyes

352
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:50,000
This is a greeting

353
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
You

354
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
When you come to work

355
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
You say hello to everyone

356
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
You don't even try

357
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
When I say it, I say it properly

358
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Liar

359
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Thank you

360
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Good evening

361
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
This is...

362
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
This is something I learned from my parents

363
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
You saw it

364
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:12,000
I don't understand how you can say good evening to such a stupid letter

365
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
No, that's something you say to this kid

366
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
You say thank you

367
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
What?

368
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
You say thank you

369
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Are you listening to the radio?

370
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I'll tell you a serious story

371
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
You get a cigarette

372
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,000
At that time, I couldn't say thank you

373
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
But I have to think about one thing

374
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:37,000
What did she want me to do?

375
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
What are you talking about?

376
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
I just did it

377
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
It's a serious story

378
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
I did it

379
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Wait

380
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Wait

381
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
What did she want me to do?

382
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Why are you crying?

383
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Why are you crying?

384
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Do you want me to read this?

385
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Sure

386
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Yuki-chan

387
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:07,000
The other day you did a commercial for Alta, didn't you?

388
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Yes

389
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Right?

390
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Yes

391
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
You did a commercial for Kikkoshibari

392
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
When you did that commercial

393
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
You said you'd do something if there were so many people

394
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
So I thought it would be nice if we all made a letter

395
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I was looking for it on the internet

396
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
What do you think?

397
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I think it would be nice if we could do it

398
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
It doesn't matter

399
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
We did it at the opening of a children's show

400
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Like this show?

401
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
I don't know if that's right

402
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I'm doing it near Tenjin

403
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I'm doing it

404
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
You have to take a helicopter from above

405
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
You have to take a helicopter from above

406
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
At that time I went skydiving

407
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Are you stupid?

408
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Are you stupid?

409
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
I know the trick

410
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
I don't know

411
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
That's not good

412
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Let's think about the opening of a children's show

413
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Right?

414
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
That's all for today

415
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
That's right

416
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
I can't do it with you anymore

417
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Really

418
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Aikata

419
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
I can't do it anymore

420
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
It's hot

421
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
It's already 8 o'clock

422
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I can't do it

423
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
It's not fashionable

424
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:23,000
When it's 8 o'clock, all the cars I got in are pumpkins

425
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
At this moment

426
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Yes

427
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
What should we do?

428
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
In November

429
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
If that time comes, let's talk about it again

430
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Yes

431
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
If you can make a sentence

432
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Let's meet in front of Alta

433
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
No

434
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
I'll be scolded again

435
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,500
You'll be scolded again. You'll be taken away again.

436
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,000
I'll dress up as a cat.

437
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:49,500
That's enough.

438
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:52,500
Next week, on this show,

439
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,000
I'll be in Okinawa.

440
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,500
I'll go to Okinawa.

441
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,000
I'll dance while I'm in Okinawa.

442
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
That's all for now.

443
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
We'll see you next week.

444
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Good bye!

445
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:07,500
They'll tell me to dance while I'm laughing.

446
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:11,500
I'll dance while I'm laughing.
