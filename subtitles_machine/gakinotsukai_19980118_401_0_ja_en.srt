1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Tonight's opening is Yamazaki vs. Kokoriko Endo's Gag Battle.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The final stage is nearing completion.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Yamazaki, are you okay with the Gag?

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Are you okay?

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I'm okay. Why do I have to fight Endo?

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Today is the Gag Battle between Endo and Yamazaki.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
This is the first time.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
That's right.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm counting on you.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I won't lose.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
To be honest, Yamazaki and Endo have the same character.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
So I want to be sure.

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Which one is better?

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Which one is better?

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Wait a minute.

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Which one is better?

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Is it that far?

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
That's right.

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
That's me.

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I won't lose.

21
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Ryu-san.

22
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I won't lose.

23
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
That's right.

24
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm setting it up now.

25
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
At that time, a man suddenly stood up in front of everyone waiting for the set to be completed.

26
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Excuse me.

27
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Komurasaki-san is laughing and I can't set it up.

28
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Excuse me.

29
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Can you hear me?

30
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Who is laughing?

31
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Komurasaki.

32
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
What if I go?

33
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
It's going to be hard.

34
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Komurasaki-san is laughing.

35
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
That's good.

36
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
It's going to be hard.

37
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Komurasaki Kozo, the director of Gaki no Tsukai.

38
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
When he was making the Gaki no Tsukai calendar, he appeared as a model in June.

39
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
He made everyone laugh.

40
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
And when he started laughing, everyone around him started laughing too.

41
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
He has a mysterious power.

42
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I can't do this.

43
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:54,000
What's going on in downtown?

44
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Let's talk for now.

45
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Excuse me.

46
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Excuse me.

47
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Excuse me.

48
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:21,000
It's too late.

49
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I can't set it up.

50
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Sugai-san.

51
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Yes.

52
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Let's leave it at that.

53
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
It's cold.

54
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I know.

55
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Sugai-san, please.

56
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Why are you drinking beer again?

57
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
It's in the way.

58
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
It's funny.

59
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I'm drinking a lot.

60
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I can't stand that smile.

61
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
What's going on?

62
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Do it.

63
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Komu-san.

64
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I'm sorry.

65
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Do it now.

66
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I'm sorry.

67
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I'm drunk.

68
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I can't lose.

69
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:10,000
The damage caused by Komura-saki subsided and the setting of the stage was resumed.

70
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Sugai-chan, are you okay now?

71
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I'm fine now.

72
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
What's going on?

73
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
There was a car accident.

74
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I went back to my hometown on New Year's Day.

75
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I was spending time with my family.

76
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I went back to my hometown on New Year's Day.

77
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
That's my hometown.

78
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
That's your hometown.

79
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
What kind of hometown is that?

80
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Are you ready?

81
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I'm ready.

82
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Komura-saki-san, you're smiling again.

83
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
What?

84
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I told you earlier.

85
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
If he moves, it's over.

86
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
We have to go.

87
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Yes.

88
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Please.

89
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
It's such a town.

90
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I'm sorry. It's not such a town.

91
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Sugai-chan, say something.

92
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I'm sorry.

93
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
What's that?

94
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Are you drunk?

95
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Komura-saki appears again and gets in the way.

96
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
What did he do this time?

97
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Komura-saki appears again and gets in the way.

98
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
What is this?

99
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Why are you eating chocolate?

100
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
You're going to eat it, aren't you?

101
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
You're going to eat it, aren't you?

102
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I'm hungry.

103
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Sugai-chan, let's do it.

104
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I know.

105
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I can tell from the sign behind you.

106
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Komura-saki is everywhere.

107
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I'm from Edo.

108
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I'm from Edo.

109
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Seriously.

110
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Sugai-chan.

111
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I'm sorry.

112
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Please.

113
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I got it.

114
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I'm going to eat it.

115
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
You're going to eat it.

116
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I know it's fun.

117
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
But you have to enjoy it over there.

118
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I'm going to eat it.

119
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I'm going to eat it.

120
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
What are you laughing at?

121
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
It's more fun when I'm going to eat it.

122
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
He returns to the bus and prepares again.

123
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,000
And the production of the set was done in a hurry.

124
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I'm sorry.

125
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
You can't do that.

126
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I'm sorry.

127
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I don't want to get in the way of the staff.

128
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
That's right.

129
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I'm so motivated.

130
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
That's right.

131
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
You're so excited.

132
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I'm excited.

133
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Let's go.

134
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Let's go.

135
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Komura-saki is laughing.

136
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
This is a little...

137
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
It's a little awkward.

138
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
It's okay.

139
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Let's go.

140
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Let's do it right away.

141
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I'm sorry.

142
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Thank you.

143
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I'm sorry.

144
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I'm sorry.

145
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
This time, it's a sudden down town.

146
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
He is nervous.

147
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
The staff around me are laughing at me.

148
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
That's right.

149
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I'm sorry.

150
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I'm sorry.

151
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
The staff around me are laughing at me.

152
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I'm sorry.

153
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I'm sorry.

154
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I'm sorry.

155
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Hey.

156
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I can't do this.

157
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I can't do this.

158
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Komura-san.

159
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I can't listen to you.

160
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I can't do this.

161
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I can't do this.

162
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Komura.

163
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Do it again.

164
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I can't do this.

165
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
He laughed.

166
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
He laughed.

167
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Why are you laughing?

168
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Why are you laughing?

169
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I can't do this anymore.

170
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Let's go home.

171
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I can't do this anymore.

172
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Let's go home.

173
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Let's go home.

174
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I'm sorry.

175
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I can't do this anymore.

176
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I can't do this anymore.

177
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:33,000
In the end, Ikko gave up this week's opening and went to the talk show.

178
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Let's go home.

179
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I'm sorry.

180
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Let's go home.

181
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Be careful.

182
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I'm sorry for saying harsh things.

183
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I can't do this anymore.

184
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Do you want to do it another week?

185
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Why don't you do it again next week?

186
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
It's okay.

187
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Let's go back to the talk show.

188
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Let's go to the talk show today.

189
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,500
Yes, that's right.

190
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:58,500
When the bus with Ikko was about to head to the venue...

191
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,500
Excuse me.

192
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,000
What?

193
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,500
Please come here.

194
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,500
What?

195
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,000
Excuse me. Please come here.

196
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,000
This is bad.

197
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Hey!

198
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,500
Hey, hey!

199
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,500
Sugai-san, please...

200
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,500
Excuse me.

201
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:16,500
Please get out of here.

202
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,500
Let's think about it.

203
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,500
Come on.

204
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,500
Seriously.

205
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,500
Let's go. Let's go.

206
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,000
What is that?

207
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:38,500
This program is brought to you by the following sponsors.

208
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,500
Idiot! Idiot! Idiot!

209
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,500
Idiot! Idiot!

210
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,500
Idiot! Idiot!

211
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,500
Idiot! Idiot!

212
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,500
Idiot! Idiot!

213
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,500
Idiot! Idiot!

214
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,500
Idiot! Idiot!

215
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,500
Idiot! Idiot!

216
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,500
Idiot! Idiot!

217
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,500
Like this?

218
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,500
I don't get it.

219
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,500
Isn't it too small?

220
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,500
The sound is too loud.

221
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,500
Let me talk.

222
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,500
It was good that the sound was loud.

223
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,500
Let's do it again.

224
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,500
This is no good.

225
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,500
Grandma! Grandma! Grandma!

226
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,500
Grandma! Grandma! Grandma!

227
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,500
Grandma!

228
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,500
Grandma!

229
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:19,500
Grandma!

230
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,500
She is so dumb!

231
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,500
Say it backwards.

232
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,500
Idiot! Idiot! Idiot!

233
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,500
Idiot! Idiot!

234
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:24,500
Idiot!

235
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:25,500
Like this?

236
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,500
It was good.

237
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,500
But it's our new device.

238
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,500
It seems impossible to make.

239
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:42,500
I wonder if there's a way to make it better.

240
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:45,500
The background should be better.

241
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:49,000
If it's just that, it's not like we can get out of here with just Bakachiko

242
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:54,500
Actually, the first time I went this year was last year's Kure

243
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,500
The 400th anniversary

244
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,500
Yes, this is actually the first time I went this year

245
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,500
That's right

246
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,500
Did you take your time?

247
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,500
I did

248
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,500
Where did you go this year?

249
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:10,500
This year, I don't really want to say it, but I went to Hokkaido

250
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,500
I went to Hokkaido from Gantan

251
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,500
In slippers?

252
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:18,500
I didn't want to wear slippers, so I wore boots

253
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:21,500
I don't know what to say

254
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,500
Why?

255
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,500
The food was delicious

256
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,500
The food was delicious

257
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,500
I ate ramen all of a sudden

258
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,500
That's good

259
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,500
Miso ramen

260
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:33,500
There was a photo of you at the Miso ramen shop I went to

261
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,500
What was that?

262
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,500
I had no choice

263
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:40,500
There was a photo of me with the store manager

264
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:43,500
Why didn't I take a photo of you from Gantan?

265
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,500
Why didn't I take a photo of you from Gantan?

266
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:49,500
That made me feel bad

267
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,500
Is that so?

268
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,500
Yes

269
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:52,500
Clockwork ramen

270
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,500
Clockwork ramen

271
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,500
Yes, clockwork ramen

272
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,500
I arrived

273
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,500
I ate ramen all of a sudden

274
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:00,500
I wanted to eat ramen in Hokkaido

275
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,500
I ate ramen

276
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,500
This was delicious

277
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,500
It was better than Tokyo

278
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,500
It was delicious

279
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,500
It was different

280
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,500
Now that I think about it

281
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,500
That was the peak

282
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:13,500
After that, it was a mess

283
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:16,500
It was a mess

284
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,500
It was 5 degrees below zero

285
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:19,500
It was night

286
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,500
That's right

287
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,500
I wasn't walking alone

288
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,500
You didn't choose a place like that

289
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,500
I didn't know

290
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,500
No

291
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,500
There was a town

292
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:31,500
I went to a coffee shop

293
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,500
A coffee shop?

294
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,500
That's good

295
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:37,500
I went to a coffee shop

296
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:40,500
There was a fortune teller

297
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,500
It was on the table

298
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,500
Yes, Gantan did this

299
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,500
There was a ball

300
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:48,500
I hit it and there was this

301
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:53,500
It said the lucky place was Okinawa

302
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,500
Ouch

303
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,500
It was like a lie

304
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:00,500
I was at the edge

305
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,500
I didn't do anything

306
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,500
I didn't do anything

307
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,500
It wasn't that bad

308
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:09,500
The miso ramen was the peak

309
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,500
It was like an organ

310
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:14,500
Did you know that?

311
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,500
The wind was strong

312
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,500
I didn't go

313
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,500
The wind was strong

314
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,500
I didn't go

315
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:21,500
I waited for 2 hours

316
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,500
It was New Year's

317
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,500
It was New Year's

318
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:27,500
At night, I couldn't eat

319
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,500
The hotel was full

320
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:30,500
No

321
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,500
I couldn't go

322
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,500
I didn't think about it

323
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,500
I couldn't help it

324
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,500
I put on my TV

325
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,500
You were talking

326
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:41,500
I was doing a fire challenger special

327
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,500
Let's go eat

328
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,500
I wanted to go eat

329
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:47,500
I went to a crab restaurant

330
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:50,500
There were many crab restaurants

331
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,500
I couldn't help it

332
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,500
I waited for 1 hour

333
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,500
I waited

334
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,500
I went back to the hotel

335
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,500
Why did you go back?

336
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,500
You should have looked for it

337
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:00,500
My ears hurt

338
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,500
I shouldn't have bought it

339
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:05,500
I should have bought it

340
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,500
My ears hurt

341
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,500
I went back to the hotel

342
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,500
I was shocked

343
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,500
I didn't know what to do

344
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,500
You're really bad at traveling

345
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:17,500
I was going to stay for 2 nights

346
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,500
You should have gone home

347
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,500
I tried to run away the next day

348
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,500
I went to the airport

349
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:26,500
I went to the airport and looked for Tokyo

350
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,500
It was full

351
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,500
It was full

352
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,500
I made a reservation

353
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,500
There were about 100 people

354
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,500
I was worried

355
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:37,500
I didn't want to go to Hokkaido again

356
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,500
I went to another place

357
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,500
I looked for it

358
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,500
Nagoya was open

359
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:42,500
You should have gone to Nagoya

360
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:45,500
I went to Nagoya

361
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,500
You should have gone

362
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,500
I arrived in Nagoya

363
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,500
The restaurant in Nagoya wasn't open

364
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,500
I was shocked

365
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,500
I couldn't even take medicine

366
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,500
You were talking

367
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,500
I wanted to go home

368
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,500
I wanted to go home

369
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,500
You're stupid

370
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,500
I came to Nagoya

371
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,500
I got on the plane

372
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,500
I wanted to stay

373
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,500
I wanted to stay

374
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:14,500
The next day's Shinkansen was full

375
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,500
I had to go home

376
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,500
I couldn't go home

377
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,500
I couldn't go home

378
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,500
I wanted to go home

379
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,500
I didn't have a car

380
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:27,500
There was a manager in Nagoya

381
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:30,500
I forgot his name

382
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,500
I rented a car

383
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:35,500
I went to Tokyo in the morning

384
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,500
I went to Tokyo

385
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,500
It was the worst

386
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,500
It was terrible

387
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,500
Are you crying?

388
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,500
Are you crying?

389
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:48,500
I couldn't go home

390
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,500
I couldn't go home

391
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,500
I couldn't go home

392
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,500
I went home

393
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,500
I don't know what you went to do

394
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,500
I don't know what I went to do

395
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,500
I went to eat ramen

396
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:08,500
I came back to Tokyo on the 2nd

397
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,500
I spent 500,000 yen

398
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,500
What did you spend it on?

399
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,500
I only ate ramen

400
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:22,500
You spent 500,000 yen on a hotel and a plane?

401
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,500
There was a lot

402
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,500
I had to fly to Nagoya

403
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,500
You went to Nagoya

404
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,500
You didn't go to a hotel and a plane

405
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,500
You rented a car

406
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:35,500
You can't rent a car for free

407
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,500
You have a face

408
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:41,500
But you're a company person

409
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,500
I'm not a company person

410
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:49,500
I was told to leave it alone

411
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,500
You're a company person?

412
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,500
I'm a company person

413
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,500
Do you understand the flow of the story?

414
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,500
Why did you come to Nagoya and become a company person?

415
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,500
Did you pass the exam at the station?

416
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,500
I don't think so

417
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,500
I was told to leave it alone

418
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:08,500
It was really hard

419
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,500
But the crab was delicious

420
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:13,500
Did you eat it?

421
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,500
What is this?

422
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,500
You're a company person

423
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,500
You shouldn't be told that

424
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:22,500
We've been together since our debut

425
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:25,500
You have a role of a company person

426
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,500
You shouldn't be told that

427
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,500
You're a company person

428
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:47,500
What is this?

429
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:50,500
If you don't go home early today

430
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,500
It's going to snow a lot

431
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,500
It's going to snow at night

432
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,500
It's worse than the other day

433
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:59,500
The other day when I was going to work

434
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,500
I was going to take the expressway

435
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:05,500
But the expressway was frozen in the snow

436
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:08,500
I had no choice but to tell my manager Fujiwara

437
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:11,500
That I was going to be late

438
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,500
So I called him

439
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,500
The expressway is frozen in the snow

440
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:22,500
I'm sorry

441
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,500
It hurts

442
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:28,500
That's not why I called you

443
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:31,500
You're putting out a lot of oil

444
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,500
The expressway is frozen in the snow

445
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,500
I don't know what time it will arrive

446
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,500
But I'm sure you'll be late

447
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:42,500
I'm really sorry

448
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:47,500
What are you apologizing for?

449
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:52,500
Are you a company person?

450
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:55,500
After working for two years as an emergency fund

451
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,500
As a Tokyo girl

452
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,500
Matsumoto Yoshimoto

453
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,500
Yes

454
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:03,500
You often categorize women's breasts

455
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,500
As the O-an type, the Tsurigane type, and the Rocket type

456
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:08,500
But you categorize them into seven types

457
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:11,500
Please tell us the remaining four

458
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:14,500
Actually they say eight

459
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,500
But there are seven

460
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,500
There are seven and eight

461
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,500
Really?

462
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,500
There are seven and eight

463
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:25,500
And then there's the theory that it doesn't matter

464
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,500
Who says that?

465
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,500
The remaining four

466
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,500
Yes

467
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:33,500
And the new type

468
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:36,500
What type?

469
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,500
It's the new type

470
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,500
What type?

471
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,500
I'm only saying the new type

472
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:44,500
It's not just the appearance

473
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,500
What type?

474
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,500
Wait, there's more

475
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:51,500
And then there's the latest type

476
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,500
And then?

477
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,500
There are two more

478
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,500
That's not good

479
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,500
What is this?

480
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:00,500
You have to say three more

481
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:03,500
What do you mean I have to say three more?

482
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,500
Please say it

483
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,500
I'll say as many as I want

484
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:06,500
Please say three more

485
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:09,500
The twist type

486
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,500
Why did you stop there?

487
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:12,500
I'm starting to get excited

488
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:13,500
Don't you have the courage?

489
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,500
I have a lot of courage

490
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,500
What?

491
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:19,500
The new type? The latest type?

492
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,500
That's not possible

493
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,500
That's strange

494
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,500
You're stupid

495
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:26,500
You got caught

496
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,500
You got tricked

497
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,500
I'm sad

498
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,500
The one type, the twist type, the rocket type

499
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,500
The twist type

500
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,500
There are people who are a little twisted

501
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,500
About two out of three

502
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,500
That's not me

503
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:42,500
The twist type

504
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,500
The twist type

505
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:46,500
The twist type

506
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,500
The twist type

507
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:48,500
And then?

508
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:53,500
The twist type

509
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,500
This is the last

510
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:57,500
No, no, you're the only one who knows

511
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,500
It's only you, right?

512
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:02,500
Ah, I made a mistake

513
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:09,500
I'm asking Matsumoto-san, who has thousands of secrets

514
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:15,500
How many thousands of secrets do you have?

515
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,500
Why, why, why?

516
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:24,500
Men and women have straight hair, but why do they have curly hair?

517
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,500
Why do they have curly hair?

518
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,500
What do you think?

519
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,500
There's no point, right?

520
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,500
Even if it's curly hair

521
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:32,500
Even if it's straight hair

522
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,500
Why is there no point?

523
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,500
Is there a way to use it?

524
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,500
Curly hair?

525
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,500
There's a way to use it

526
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:39,500
What do you use it for?

527
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:43,500
The easiest way to use it is when you make bubbles with soap

528
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,500
You use it from here

529
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:46,500
Bam, bam, bam, bam

530
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,500
If you don't have that, there's nothing you can do

531
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:49,500
If you don't have that, there's nothing you can do

532
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:52,500
You use all the bubbles you made here?

533
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:53,500
That's right

534
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:56,500
Of course, you just blow it up

535
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,500
Isn't that obvious?

536
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,500
Everyone does that

537
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,500
That's just me

538
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,500
No, it's not just me

539
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,500
Everyone does it, right?

540
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,500
I don't want to

541
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:11,500
Why do you bring a person who made bubbles here?

542
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,500
That's strange

543
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,500
That's strange

544
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,500
Is it you?

545
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:16,500
No

546
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,500
The bubbles, the bubbles

547
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,500
Is it you?

548
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,500
No

549
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,500
You've done it once before

550
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,500
Once

551
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:25,500
Twice

552
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,500
Twice?

553
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:28,500
Twice

554
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,500
You have to clean it properly

555
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:31,500
Three times

556
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,500
Three times?

557
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,500
Three times?

558
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:36,500
Three times?

559
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,500
Twelve times

560
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,500
Twelve times?

561
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:40,500
Yes, yes

562
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,500
Is there anyone like that?

563
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,500
That's right

564
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:44,500
I don't think so

565
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,500
Just once, just once

566
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:47,500
There is

567
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,500
There is, isn't there?

568
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:49,500
Well, well, well

569
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,500
I'll tell you one of my private things

570
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,500
I don't want to hear it

571
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,500
Just once

572
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:56,500
Just once

573
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,500
What?

574
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:58,500
I don't want to hear it

575
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,500
Everyone does it

576
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,500
I'm sure of it

577
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:04,500
These guys are trying to make it look good

578
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,500
What are you trying to make it look good?

579
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:09,500
They are trying to make themselves sweet

580
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:13,500
Also, the season is when the temperature is high

581
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,500
Is that so?

582
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:17,500
When you go hiking or go to the snowy mountains

583
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:18,500
It's high

584
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:19,500
That's right

585
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:22,500
When you go on a date

586
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:23,500
What?

587
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:25,500
When you go on a date

588
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:28,500
You wait for the ambulance

589
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:29,500
What?

590
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,500
What?

591
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:34,500
I think the funny laugh is the best

592
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:37,500
The one that goes up little by little

593
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:40,500
The one that goes up little by little

594
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,500
I mean

595
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,500
It's not funny

596
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,500
It's funny because it's a joke

597
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,500
When I was thinking about it

598
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:49,500
I've heard it before

599
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,500
The most comfortable thing in the body

600
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,500
Is the sex

601
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:53,500
In a woman's body

602
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:54,500
It's the sex

603
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,500
Because the temperature is the highest

604
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,500
So when you think about it

605
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,500
I think it's a direct question

606
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:02,500
Because the temperature is high

607
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,500
It's burning

608
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,500
It's like

609
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,500
It's like a little boy

610
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:15,500
A little boy

611
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:16,500
It's small

612
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:17,500
It's small

613
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,500
It's like a little boy

614
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,500
It's like a little boy

615
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,500
Everyone runs around

616
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,500
It's like my son

617
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,500
Why?

618
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,500
Everyone wants to try it

619
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,500
Why are you so motivated?

620
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,500
Everyone goes home when it snows

621
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,500
What are you doing?

622
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,500
Bring the camera

623
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:48,500
Why?

624
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:49,500
Take a picture

625
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:50,500
Why?

626
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,500
It's such a sexy shot

627
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:53,500
Why?

628
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:58,500
Let's go home

629
00:23:58,500 --> 00:23:59,500
Let's go home

630
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:00,500
Thank you very much

631
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,500
What are you talking about?

632
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:03,500
Nothing

633
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:13,500
Thank you very much

634
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:14,500
To the cord here

635
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:22,500
Thank you very much
