1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000
It doesn't have anything to do with the show at all, but the age of the audience is really increasing.

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
The older you get, the older you get.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
If you go on like this, you'll end up looking like Mino Monta.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Today is the last opening of the year.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Yes, yes.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Which do you like more, to forget the year of 1993?

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Yes.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Let's go with this one.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:34,000
It's not our will, it's not our will.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
That's right, it's really not our will.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I can't put it on.

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Why?

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Okay!

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Let's go.

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Let's start with the one you like.

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Okay.

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I don't know.

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
If this old lady approaches you, let's do it.

19
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
She's a very attractive owner.

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
If she approaches me?

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
If she approaches you.

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Let's do it.

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
There's no way I'm going to do it, it's disgusting.

24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Your turn.

25
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Me?

26
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Yes.

27
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Ta-da!

28
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Ramos.

29
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Ah!

30
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
You hate Ramos?

31
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I've been on TV too much.

32
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I hate him.

33
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
He's a sports player.

34
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
You guys are the most popular right now.

35
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I've been playing soccer all my life.

36
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Liar!

37
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
What are you talking about?

38
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Your face?

39
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I'm dancing.

40
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Oh, your favorite dance.

41
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Oh!

42
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
That's amazing.

43
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Next!

44
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Kagamari-ko.

45
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I like this guy.

46
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Oh, really?

47
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
He's kind of cute.

48
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I happened to see him on TV.

49
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
He's kind of a pervert.

50
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
He's a pervert.

51
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
He's kind of a pervert.

52
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
He's a very strong person.

53
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
He's very strong.

54
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
He came to the club before.

55
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Me?

56
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I hate him.

57
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Oh, really?

58
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
You too, right?

59
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Oh, really?

60
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
You can't say that.

61
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I like this guy.

62
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
He's a half-transparent guy.

63
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I like him.

64
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I like him.

65
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
But I hate him.

66
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Why?

67
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I like him.

68
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I hate him.

69
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I hate him.

70
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I hate him.

71
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
And you're wearing pants.

72
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I hate him.

73
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
It was a life-or-death situation.

74
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
So I was so skinny.

75
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I was always shaking.

76
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I thought I had to do something about it.

77
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
So I put on a sweater.

78
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
But still, I was shaking.

79
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I took off my pants.

80
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
But still, I was shaking.

81
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I opened the door.

82
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
When I opened the door, he came out on his own.

83
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I don't know why, but he was wearing a sweater and pants.

84
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
And then!

85
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
He went somewhere else.

86
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
In the end, he got pulled over by a car.

87
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
The man who pulled him was surprised.

88
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
The old man who pulled him.

89
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
That's...

90
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
That's pitiful.

91
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Next.

92
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Super kick bass.

93
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I see.

94
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Super kick bass.

95
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
It's not funny at all.

96
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
It's not funny at all.

97
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I'm going to make it into a show.

98
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I hate it.

99
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I think I ran a little too much.

100
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I don't deny this.

101
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
It's okay for people who like to do it on Sunday to do it.

102
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Let's do kick bass.

103
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I don't know if it's funny to film it on TV and play it all over the country.

104
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I'm saying, Ken-chan, get you!

105
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Nice athlete catch!

106
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
It's not funny at all.

107
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I don't deny it.

108
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Do you have a fan of this guy?

109
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
No, I like it!

110
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
No, I like it!

111
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I like it!

112
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
It's cute.

113
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Next.

114
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I like it.

115
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I like it.

116
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I like it.

117
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I like it.

118
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I like it.

119
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I like it.

120
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I hate it.

121
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Look at this face!

122
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
It's ugly!

123
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I think it's pretty funny.

124
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,000
She's so fat, fat and ugly, what should I do?

125
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
There's no escape for this woman.

126
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
But she's sexy.

127
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Why?

128
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
She's just showing off her legs.

129
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I don't like you, Matsumoto-san.

130
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
You don't like me?

131
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I don't like you.

132
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
What is this?

133
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
There's a lot of this in your wallet.

134
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Is this your first year's total bill?

135
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I didn't want to say this at the end.

136
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
It can't be helped.

137
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
There's a lot of this.

138
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
That's right.

139
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
There's dozens of this.

140
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
There's a lot.

141
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
That's right.

142
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
There's a lot.

143
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
And when she takes a bath, she runs away through the hole.

144
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Because she'll die.

145
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
This has been enlarged.

146
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
It's smaller.

147
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
It hasn't been enlarged.

148
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
What?

149
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
This...

150
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
One, one...

151
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
It's like this.

152
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
There's a lot of this in your wallet.

153
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
And when she takes a bath, she runs away through the hole.

154
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
You're stupid.

155
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I don't think I've ever been in a sex scene.

156
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I think I was in the shower room of CX.

157
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I always take a shower when I'm on TV.

158
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
There's a mat there.

159
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I think I was there.

160
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
You shouldn't use the mat like that.

161
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Why?

162
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
The mat...

163
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
When you put on your underwear, you do this.

164
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
You put your underwear on the mat.

165
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
That's right.

166
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
The mat in the bathroom?

167
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
That's right.

168
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I put my mat on the bottom of the heater.

169
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
You're stupid.

170
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
You shouldn't do that.

171
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
No, the mat, the mat, the mat.

172
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
There's a scratch.

173
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
If you do this, your underwear will stick to the bottom.

174
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
And when you go up,

175
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
The scratch on the mat, when the underwear comes down,

176
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
You put your hand on it.

177
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Which one will win this year?

178
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Will you take it?

179
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
You're stupid.

180
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
What's wrong with you?

181
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Whether you cry or laugh, it's over.

182
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Ladies and gentlemen.

183
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
You know, I heard it today.

184
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
There was a high school student who was waiting in front of the apartment.

185
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
He was told to be careful.

186
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
He was standing in front of my apartment.

187
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
He asked a reporter,

188
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Are you waiting for Mr. Matsumoto?

189
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
What kind of relationship do you have?

190
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I'm coming again.

191
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
A new one.

192
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
That's right.

193
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Stop it.

194
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
The reaction of the apartment is cowardly.

195
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Think about it.

196
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
When you become a bad guy,

197
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
You rent a room in front of the house you live in and wait, right?

198
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
But you're aiming for a big deal, aren't you?

199
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
That's right.

200
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
But if you're in front of the apartment,

201
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
If you're like this from the window,

202
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Everyone will get a little scandal.

203
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
No matter what kind of beautiful actress you are,

204
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Open the window and you'll get a nosebleed.

205
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
There are times when you get a nosebleed.

206
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
That's right.

207
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Even if you get a nosebleed,

208
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Mr. Wada, you have to go to the window.

209
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
If you get a nosebleed,

210
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I can't do it.

211
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Don't eat it.

212
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
No matter what kind of actress you are,

213
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
If you do that, the next day in the newspaper,

214
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
You'll get a nosebleed.

215
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Why is it over?

216
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
It's hard.

217
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
When I was Nan-chan,

218
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I stayed in the same place every day.

219
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
All the time.

220
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
That's strange.

221
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
On the third day,

222
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Why is that car here again?

223
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
When I was saying that,

224
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
We came back together.

225
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Why are you two going back there?

226
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
He's an idiot.

227
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
That's right.

228
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:12,000
It would be nice if we could split up like this.

229
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
What are you calculating?

230
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
What are you doing?

231
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
There's no sand.

232
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
The sand is down there.

233
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
It's too late.

234
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
What should I do?

235
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Don't make me feel bad.

236
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I didn't do anything bad.

237
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I just put it somewhere.

238
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
If you do that,

239
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
You'll be put in a strange place.

240
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
What's a strange place?

241
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
In a place like this?

242
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
What?

243
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
What are you doing?

244
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
What makes you feel so good?

245
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
If you were a violinist,

246
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
You'd be used to it.

247
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,000
You shouldn't do that.

248
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
You shouldn't have sex.

249
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I'm not saying that.

250
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
But it's the same as what you're saying.

251
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
You can say anything to anyone,

252
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
But not to me.

253
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Don't say that.

254
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
You shouldn't.

255
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
If I take a woman,

256
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
There's nothing left.

257
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
You have golf, right?

258
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
That has nothing to do with it.

259
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I only have sex.

260
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Seriously.

261
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
That's my hobby.

262
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
That's what you're saying.

263
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
That's right.

264
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
If you take that,

265
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I'll...

266
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Why are you crying?

267
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Why are you crying?

268
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I don't know.

269
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Why are you crying?

270
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Why do you only take pictures of women?

271
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Matcha! Fishing again!

272
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
You can't do that.

273
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
You can't do that.

274
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
It's the same thing.

275
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Women are also a hobby.

276
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I just went to the dorm to get my driver's license.

277
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
And you took a picture of me.

278
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
It says, again and again.

279
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
It's the same thing.

280
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
No, no, no.

281
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
That's definitely not you.

282
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
No, no, no.

283
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
That's the same thing.

284
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
That might be the same thing.

285
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
But at night, you're the same thing.

286
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
No, no, no.

287
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
That's definitely not you.

288
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
That's definitely not you.

289
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
No, no, really.

290
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
That's why...

291
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
You can rent a fake apartment.

292
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
No matter what you do, you're going to use it anyway, right?

293
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
What do you mean?

294
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
You're going to use it anyway, right?

295
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Oh, you're so cute.

296
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Oh, you're so cute.

297
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Even if you rent a fake apartment, you're going to use it, right?

298
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
You're going to use it, right?

299
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Shut up!

300
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
You're going to use it, right?

301
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Stop it!

302
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
What are you doing?

303
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
What are you doing.

304
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Stop it!

305
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
What are you doing?

306
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
You're going to use it, right?

307
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
You're going to use it, so if you're going to use it, you should rent that fake apartment.

308
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
It's the same thing.

309
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
It'll always be found.

310
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Why?

311
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I don't know if you have a house or anything.

312
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
When you leave the set, I don't know if you're following me from behind.

313
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
When you're at work.

314
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
What should I do?

315
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Do whatever you want.

316
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:18,000
If you were caught once as much as you want, I'd be laughing with your girl.

317
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
But if that's the case, I don't think I'll be able to get over it.

318
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Or you two can do this...

319
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I can do this...

320
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
And the woman can do this...

321
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I wonder if she'll do it for me.

322
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Recently, the prank calls have changed.

323
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Well, it's better now.

324
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
But in the past, it was really terrible.

325
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
The phone was ringing all the time.

326
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I would call that phone a prank call.

327
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
That's true.

328
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
That's definitely true.

329
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
A prank call.

330
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I would say, take the prank call.

331
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
No matter how many times I call, I don't know why.

332
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
It's definitely from NTT.

333
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Even if I say, what's wrong with you?

334
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I would say, I'm from NTT.

335
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I don't know why.

336
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
That's true.

337
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
But it's an organization, so I don't know what to say.

338
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
But it's an organization, so I don't know what to say.

339
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
But even if I say, hey, I'm from NTT.

340
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
It would be a problem for her.

341
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
It would be a problem for her.

342
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
What do you mean?

343
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I didn't tell anyone this time.

344
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I only had my phone.

345
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I didn't have to tell anyone.

346
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I didn't tell anyone about my phone number.

347
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Only my manager, Okamoto, knew.

348
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Then why did you call me?

349
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Okamoto doesn't know either.

350
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Bring me the phone.

351
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Why?

352
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Why?

353
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Today, Mr. Matsumoto.

354
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Today, Mr. Matsumoto.

355
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
You're not wearing a hanagi today.

356
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
You're not wearing a hanagi today.

357
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Put it down.

358
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Who will win the white-white?

359
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Who will win the white-white?

360
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Let's see the result.

361
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Let's see the result.

362
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Let's see the result.

363
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Let's play a punishment game.

364
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I wrote the winning and losing history of the last 10 years.

365
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I wrote the winning and losing history of the last 10 years.

366
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Last year, I won the white.

367
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
You won the white.

368
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I got it.

369
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
This time, I'll use the board.

370
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
This is the white group.

371
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
The first appearance.

372
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
This is a boom.

373
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
This is a boom.

374
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Takayama Gen-san, I'll freeze your heart.

375
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Who is it?

376
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
This person is the leading singer.

377
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
What kind of song is it?

378
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Let my heart freeze.

379
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Let my heart freeze.

380
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I don't know if it's true or not.

381
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I don't know if it's true or not.

382
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
You're such a fool.

383
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Just in case.

384
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Fukuyama.

385
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Fukuyama Masahara.

386
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Checkers last year.

387
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Checkers last year.

388
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Red.

389
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Red.

390
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Red.

391
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Red.

392
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Red.

393
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Red.

394
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Red.

395
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I'm not saying anything.

396
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I'm not saying anything.

397
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Look, it's a bull.

398
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
That's true.

399
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
That's true.

400
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
That's true.

401
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I don't have 5 points.

402
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I don't have red points either.

403
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I don't have winter vacation.

404
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I don't want it.

405
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I don't want it.

406
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I don't want it.

407
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
The rest is...

408
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
S.M.A.P.

409
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
S.M.A.P.?

410
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
You don't know?

411
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I don't know.

412
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Really?

413
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
What is this 10 dollars?

414
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,000
It's the sales of these kids.

415
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Well, that's right.

416
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Oh, there's a troupe.

417
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Oh, there's a troupe?

418
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Shall we go to the next word?

419
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
This is the only one left.

420
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
You fool!

421
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Don't joke around with jokes!

422
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
It's the 31st day of Kohaku!

423
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
J!

424
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
O!

425
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I don't even know if it's here or here.

426
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
You don't know?

427
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
It doesn't matter.

428
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I don't even know if it's here or here.

429
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,000
This time, Kobayashi-san is thinking about something else.

430
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
This person is smart.

431
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
He's a strategist.

432
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
There's something like that, so I can't get rid of it.

433
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I can't get rid of it.

434
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Will it be K?

435
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
It will be K.

436
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Won't it be Cho Yonpil?

437
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Cho Yonpil...

438
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Cho-san?

439
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
No, it won't be me.

440
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Gao!

441
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
What's with his face?

442
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
If Gao asks me to go out with him, it'll be hard.

443
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
It'll be hard, right?

444
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
There's also a drama called Dolly's Come True.

445
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Dolly's?

446
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
What's Dolly's?

447
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Dolly's...

448
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Can't you read it?

449
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Yugi Saori-san and his sister...

450
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Wow!

451
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
In Moon Desert...

452
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Yasuda Shouko-san.

453
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Why Moon Desert?

454
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Originally, Yugi Saori-san is a poet.

455
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
That's right, but Moon Desert...

456
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Who is this?

457
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Nakamura Mitsuko.

458
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Who is this?

459
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Shimada no Bunbun.

460
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Shimada no Bunbun?

461
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
What is this?

462
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Do you really know her?

463
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I don't know her.

464
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,000
She'll probably be stopped when she enters the dressing room.

465
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Excuse me.

466
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
She'll be asked, who is this?

467
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Nakamura Mitsuko.

468
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
So, who is this?

469
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
It'll be hard.

470
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
She'll be 30 minutes late.

471
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
She'll be late for the entrance.

472
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
She'll be late for the entrance.

473
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
This man will be angry.

474
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Are you underestimating me?

475
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
What are you doing?

476
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
What are you doing?

477
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
What are you doing?

478
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
He'll come out.

479
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
In Moon Desert...

480
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
In Moon Desert...

481
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Yasuda Shouko-san.

482
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
He'll be scolded again.

483
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Please go out with me.

484
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Who is this?

485
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Is this year white or red?

486
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I'm white.

487
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
If you're going to be so white...

488
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I don't think white is that strong.

489
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Is that so?

490
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
That's right.

491
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Then, I'm red.

492
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
You're really not red.

493
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
If you were told to give it to me...

494
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Even if you told me to give it to you...

495
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
I don't know if I'd really give it to you.

496
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
But I'm pretty confident that I'm red.

497
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
But if you told me to give it to you...

498
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I probably wouldn't give it to you.

499
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
But I don't feel like giving it to you.

500
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
If you say that...

501
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
What would you do?

502
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Would you give it to me?

503
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
I don't care.

504
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Rock-paper-scissors.

505
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
This guy is dirty.

506
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Rock-paper-scissors.

507
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Rock-paper-scissors.

508
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Rock-paper-scissors.

509
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
You really don't have confidence.

510
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Tengu rock-paper-scissors.

511
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:09,000
You really don't have confidence.

512
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
You really don't have confidence.

513
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
I told you I don't have confidence.

514
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Let's go.

515
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Even if you cry or laugh...

516
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
I don't care.

517
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Rock-paper-scissors.

518
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Rock-paper-scissors.

519
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:30,000
It hurts.

520
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
I really wanted to punch you.

521
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I'm going to kill you.

522
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Hurry up and save.

523
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Let's go.

524
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Rock-paper-scissors.

525
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Rock-paper-scissors.

526
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Good job!

527
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Good job!

528
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
I'm so happy!

529
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
I'm so happy!

530
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Red!

531
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,640
Go f**k yourself!!
