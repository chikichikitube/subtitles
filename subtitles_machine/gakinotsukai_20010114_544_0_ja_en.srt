1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,160
Black Eyed Girls

2
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:19,180
Everyone, well..

3
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:21,240
If you have a stomach pain you can do it

4
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,200
This is all you think is handsome

5
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:27,200
It's true! I'm sure of it!

6
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:30,200
I'm sure of it!

7
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:36,200
This program is brought to you by the following sponsors.

8
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,200
Well...

9
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:44,200
I was in Guam, but it wasn't like that when I was there.

10
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,200
Well, that's how it is.

11
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,200
Well, that's how it is.

12
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,200
I was surprised when I came back.

13
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,200
Well...

14
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,200
Rather than being sunburned, I was burning up.

15
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:58,200
I was burning up.

16
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:01,200
I was burning up.

17
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,200
It's a little scary.

18
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,200
Well, that's how it is.

19
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:07,200
I was surprised when I came back.

20
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,200
Well...

21
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,200
Well, that's how it is.

22
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,200
Well, that's how it is.

23
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,200
But, in Guam...

24
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,200
But, in Guam...

25
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,200
I stopped going to Guam in the New Year.

26
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,200
Why?

27
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,200
There were a lot of things I didn't like.

28
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,200
I see.

29
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,200
The sunburn you see on your face...

30
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:27,200
Even your dark circles were a bit white.

31
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:32,200
I can see the wrinkles on your dark circles.

32
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:35,200
I can see the wrinkles on your dark circles.

33
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,200
I'm done this year.

34
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,200
I'm done this year.

35
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,200
Why?

36
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,200
It's not going to work this year.

37
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,200
It's not going to work this year.

38
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,200
You almost ruined my hangup.

39
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,200
I mean it.

40
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:45,200
I'm not even joking. I don't care about the customers.

41
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,200
I almost died from the sunburn in Guam.

42
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:54,200
But that's the same level as what you always say about a broken rib, right?

43
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:58,200
Like a broken rib just from falling from a step like this, right?

44
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,200
It's a different level.

45
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,200
I almost died in a hotel bath in Guam.

46
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,200
Ah, that's...

47
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,200
I washed my feet like this, right?

48
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:11,200
And the bathtub in the bath wasn't flat enough.

49
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,200
It was a bathtub like this.

50
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,200
And I washed my feet, right?

51
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,200
And there was no place to put my feet.

52
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:21,200
And I went like this.

53
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,200
And they said, shut up!

54
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,200
I went crazy.

55
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,200
I managed to do a Kokemite.

56
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:33,200
And on the edge of the bathtub...

57
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:39,200
I went like this.

58
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,200
I mean...

59
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:43,200
What's a bathtub?

60
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,200
On the edge.

61
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,200
You've hit your head, right?

62
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,200
A little bit.

63
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,200
Like a bump, right?

64
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,200
It's different.

65
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,200
If you hit it that much...

66
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,200
It goes like this.

67
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,200
At that time...

68
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,200
I went like this to the hot spring.

69
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:06,200
And it was a hot tub!

70
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:09,200
But my brain was shaking.

71
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,200
I didn't know it was hot.

72
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:15,200
I thought it was cold.

73
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,200
I don't know if it was hot or cold.

74
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,200
I was in the hot tub for a while.

75
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,200
And I was lying down.

76
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,200
You couldn't move?

77
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,200
I couldn't move.

78
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,200
Really.

79
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:29,200
I thought I was going to die...

80
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:34,200
in the bathtub in Guam.

81
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,200
I was going to die.

82
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:39,200
Didn't you say that?

83
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,200
I thought so.

84
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,200
It was really bad.

85
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,200
But you were okay after that, right?

86
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,200
But I was scared.

87
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,200
I thought I was going to die in a few hours.

88
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,200
I know that.

89
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,200
Right?

90
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,200
I was really scared.

91
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,200
I was on the poolside.

92
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,200
I thought I was going to die.

93
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,200
You thought you were going to die?

94
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,200
I thought I was going to die.

95
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,200
I was really scared.

96
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,200
That's why I couldn't move.

97
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:07,200
I was like this.

98
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,200
I wasn't laughing.

99
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,200
It's nothing.

100
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,200
Be grateful.

101
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,200
Why?

102
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:18,200
I wanted to go to the place where I worked hard.

103
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,200
I chose that place.

104
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:23,200
If I thought I was going to die, I would have gone there.

105
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,200
You didn't go there.

106
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,200
I went there completely.

107
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,200
You didn't come back alive.

108
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,200
What would happen?

109
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:31,200
A person who was going to die on New Year's Day...

110
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,200
would he be able to survive this year?

111
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:36,200
He didn't die, so he would survive.

112
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:39,200
If he had died...

113
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:42,200
Why do you look like you're going to die?

114
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:46,200
I died three times.

115
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,200
You look like you're going to die.

116
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,200
Maybe it's because I just got hit today.

117
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,200
Is that so?

118
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:55,200
You just got hit.

119
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,200
You just got hit.

120
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,200
You said you were going to hit me.

121
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,200
I don't say it now.

122
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,200
Let's stop the Osaka fight.

123
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,200
You say it, too.

124
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,200
I say I can hit you.

125
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:10,200
I say it's plastic.

126
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,200
Let's stop it.

127
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:14,200
Plastic, plastic.

128
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:17,200
Plastic is plastic.

129
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,200
Where did you go?

130
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:21,200
I went to Las Vegas.

131
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,200
That's cool.

132
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,200
It's not cool.

133
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,200
Who did you go with?

134
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,200
I went with my family.

135
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:30,200
That's nice.

136
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:35,200
I don't want to go abroad on New Year's.

137
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,200
Really?

138
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,200
I don't want to.

139
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,200
I heard you went abroad.

140
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:43,200
You said you were going to fight.

141
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,200
That's right.

142
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:47,200
When I went abroad...

143
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:52,200
the reporter didn't know what I was going to do.

144
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:55,200
He asked me what year I wanted to be.

145
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:58,200
I said I wanted to be a snake.

146
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,200
I said I was already a snake.

147
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,200
He came back to me and asked me again.

148
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:06,200
I said I was already a snake, so I didn't care.

149
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:09,200
He asked me a lot about the future.

150
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,200
Miyasako was there, too.

151
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:14,200
I said I wanted to ask her, too.

152
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,200
She said, how is it?

153
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:19,200
I asked Yamashita.

154
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:22,200
Miyasako was depressed.

155
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:27,200
I had to do my best.

156
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,200
He doesn't understand.

157
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,200
He doesn't understand?

158
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,200
Yes.

159
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,200
Is that so? Did you write a lot about it?

160
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,200
It seems so.

161
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,200
I've heard a lot about it.

162
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:43,200
I decided not to go on a trip with Yamashita.

163
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:43,200
Why?

164
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,200
He's a dummy.

165
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,200
Why?

166
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,200
He's a fool.

167
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:49,200
Oh, really?

168
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:53,200
On Gundam Day, when we were going to the pool together,

169
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:57,200
he didn't sleep much at the end of the year.

170
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,200
To be honest, he wanted to sleep.

171
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:02,200
So I told him to let me sleep today.

172
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,200
I said, let's leave him alone for now.

173
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,200
Let's go to the pool together.

174
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:10,200
I told him to write a message and put it under the door.

175
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,200
I wrote Yamashita and told him to go.

176
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,200
He got out of the car and said, yes.

177
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:18,200
There wasn't as much space as I thought.

178
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:23,200
I said, I'll put 5mm of it and it'll be blowing in the wind.

179
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,200
I'll go back in a gas pose.

180
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,200
I said, okay.

181
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,200
I'll fly for sure.

182
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,200
I see.

183
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,200
You'll have to put it in longer.

184
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:34,200
I'll be sure to be blown away by the wind.

185
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,200
I said, think about it.

186
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,200
I said, okay.

187
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:41,200
I'll go back and turn the door mat and put a sticker there.

188
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,200
I said, okay.

189
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,200
That's...

190
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,200
You'll have to come back and clean it.

191
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,200
I said, no.

192
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,200
I'll clean it.

193
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:54,200
I'll be blown away by the wind.

194
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:57,200
I'll open the garage and turn the door.

195
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,200
You'll understand.

196
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,200
I said, okay.

197
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,200
I said, okay.

198
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:05,200
I said, okay.

199
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,200
I'm an idiot.

200
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,200
I said, okay.

201
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:13,200
I'll put it where I put the card machine.

202
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,200
I said, okay.

203
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:17,200
I'll ask you to put it in the room.

204
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,200
More than half of it.

205
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:22,200
That's more than enough.

206
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,200
I'll go back.

207
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,200
That's a bad idea.

208
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,200
That's a bad idea.

209
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,200
That's stupid.

210
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:36,200
Miyasako came to my house because she forgot her cap.

211
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:39,200
She asked me to put it in the post office.

212
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,200
When Miyasako woke up, she went in.

213
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:45,200
I called him, and he said he didn't go in yet, so what does that mean?

214
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,200
He said he didn't have a place to put it.

215
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,200
There's no way.

216
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,200
Then what do you do with the letter?

217
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,200
There's no way.

218
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,200
There's a place where there's a lot of boxes, right?

219
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,200
Put it in there.

220
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,200
He said he didn't have it.

221
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,200
He said he couldn't tell the number just by having the key.

222
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,200
Then what is it?

223
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,200
The postman, the newspaper editor, all of them locked the door and opened it.

224
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,200
You can definitely put it in.

225
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,200
He said he didn't have it.

226
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,200
He said he didn't have it.

227
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:15,200
He said he didn't have it.

228
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,200
He said he didn't have it.

229
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,200
I think we need to take care of him a little more.

230
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:26,200
If I was his junior, I think he would be a really good junior.

231
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,200
I don't know what to say.

232
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:31,200
I don't know, he was just sitting there, riding a high-speed train.

233
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,200
When the toll booth was getting closer, I should have already prepared it.

234
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:37,200
I couldn't get in after I got there.

235
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:42,200
One of the doors in the back was open.

236
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,200
I was in a hurry.

237
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,200
I prepared the money.

238
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:49,200
I only opened it for a little while, so I had to do it again.

239
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:56,200
When I was about to pay, he was the only one who took the ticket.

240
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,200
You should have said that too.

241
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,200
That's a little bad.

242
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,200
I see.

243
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,200
That can't be helped.

244
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,200
Thank you.

245
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:10,200
If I had a bigger hand, I would have done it better.

246
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,200
What do you mean?

247
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:17,200
I would have done it with this much of a hand.

248
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,200
You would have made the area wider.

249
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,200
But I don't want one hand.

250
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,200
I want both hands.

251
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,200
I don't want a partner like that.

252
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,200
I want only one hand.

253
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:31,200
I'm going to eat rice from this year.

254
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,200
I'm going to eat white rice.

255
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,200
I'm going to introduce a split.

256
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,200
Why is that?

257
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,200
That's because...

258
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,200
That's enough.

259
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,200
Everyone is making money.

260
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,200
Why do I always have to pay?

261
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,200
That's strange.

262
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,200
Are you making money?

263
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,200
I'm making money.

264
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,200
Is that so?

265
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,200
That's strange.

266
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,200
I don't want to do it anymore.

267
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:57,200
It doesn't matter if people say I'm stingy.

268
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,200
Why do I have to pay for everything?

269
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,200
Last year we had a year-end party.

270
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,200
Let's go to Fuku.

271
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,200
We called a lot of juniors.

272
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,200
But in the end it was me who had to pay.

273
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,200
If I went to Fuku, it would have cost me 200,000 to 300,000 yen.

274
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:19,200
If I paid for it, who would pay for it?

275
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,200
Who would pay for 200,000 to 300,000 yen?

276
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:25,200
You should have said that to that girl.

277
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,200
I can be more generous than Fuku.

278
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:35,200
What?

279
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:39,200
That's too generous.

280
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,200
I don't care about money.

281
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,200
I don't care about money.

282
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,200
I'm going to quit.

283
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,200
But you should have a year-end party.

284
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,200
I'll still do it.

285
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,200
It's already the tenth.

286
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:58,200
It's already the tenth.

287
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,200
Yamazaki, please give me a year-end party.

288
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,200
He kicked me from the top.

289
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:05,200
He's a little cheeky.

290
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,200
I haven't done it every year, but I can't help it this year.

291
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:12,200
I can't do it anymore.

292
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:21,200
Yamazaki, let's go.

293
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:26,200
I wanted to do it too.

294
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:31,200
Do you remember when we were doing Tsumura Illusion in Japan?

295
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:35,200
White Tiger came and Zeke Freed Android.

296
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,200
White Tiger was doing it.

297
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,200
He was still there.

298
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,200
He suddenly became an old man.

299
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,200
Do you know that?

300
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:48,200
I know.

301
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:51,200
I saw a pamphlet in Guam.

302
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:56,200
There was an Italian restaurant called Peppino Oji.

303
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,200
There was an old man who was very cheerful.

304
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:01,200
He said, everyone, come and eat.

305
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,200
I said, let's go.

306
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,200
He became an old man.

307
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,200
He didn't react at all.

308
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:13,200
No way.

309
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,200
He was a different person.

310
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,200
He was a big old man.

311
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:21,200
He ran around so much when he came to Japan.

312
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,200
That's right.

313
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:30,200
He came down from the top.

314
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:33,200
That's true.

315
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,200
I have to do the show from now on.

316
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,200
That's true.

317
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:46,200
Zeke Freed is a different person.

318
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:49,200
He didn't move at all.

319
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:52,200
Only his partner, White Tiger, was like this.

320
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,200
He disappeared.

321
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:57,200
There are sad things like that.

322
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,200
At a circus or something.

323
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:04,200
The clown who was doing it was wearing a lot of makeup.

324
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,200
He was wearing a lot.

325
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,200
I can't forgive him because he's a human being.

326
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:13,200
There are animals that are strange.

327
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,200
They have something coming out of their asses.

328
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:18,200
Even a monkey has something like a rose coming out of its ass.

329
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,200
That's because it's such an ass.

330
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,200
There are monkeys that have something like a rose coming out of their asses.

331
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,200
But it's a monkey like that.

332
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,200
It's like a rocket launcher.

333
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,200
That's true.

334
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:29,200
That kind of thing is not good.

335
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:39,200
If you put your partner like this and do it at a high place, he disappears.

336
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:43,200
Only his partner has started.

337
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:49,200
All of them.

338
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:56,200
Only existence is walking alone.

339
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,200
It can't be helped.

340
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,200
I think he's walking alone.

341
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:04,200
Without a doubt, he will disappear throughout the year.

342
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,200
He will.

343
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:11,200
This is a question for Mr. Matsumoto, who has been an astronaut many times since the time of NASA's Apollo project.

344
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,200
Yes.

345
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:24,200
Even if you enter the atmosphere barefoot, how do you live without burning out?

346
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:29,200
How long do I have to answer such a useless question?

347
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,200
No, no.

348
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:37,200
It's okay if you don't answer.

349
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:40,200
But you know, right?

350
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,200
It might be a sin to know this.

351
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,200
Right?

352
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,200
So please tell me.

353
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,200
Don't you know?

354
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:51,200
You're wearing a jumper like that.

355
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,200
No, I don't know.

356
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,200
Why?

357
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,200
I don't know.

358
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,200
Do you know the atmosphere?

359
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,200
No, I don't know.

360
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,200
That's amazing.

361
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:02,200
It's tens of thousands of hertz.

362
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,200
I mean, if you put it in hertz.

363
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,200
No, I don't want to put it in hertz.

364
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,200
Then let's say the distance.

365
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,200
No, I don't want to say the distance.

366
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,200
What is it?

367
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,200
It's a very hot line.

368
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,200
It's a hot line.

369
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:15,200
A hot line?

370
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,200
You're a hot line?

371
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,200
What?

372
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,200
No, no.

373
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,200
What?

374
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:25,200
You're a hot line? That's strange.

375
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:29,200
It's a hot line.

376
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:32,200
Now, when it's dug out there.

377
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,200
How can I protect myself?

378
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,200
Who can protect me?

379
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,200
I'm the only one.

380
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,200
At this point.

381
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,200
And by what I'm saying here.

382
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:42,200
The people who heard this can protect themselves.

383
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,200
Well, if that's the case.

384
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,200
If it's too much.

385
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,200
It can't be.

386
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,200
The age of the universe is coming.

387
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,200
It's coming.

388
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,200
I don't think that's the case.

389
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,200
I can't do that with my body.

390
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,200
Well, you have to try to avoid it.

391
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,200
Yes, yes, yes.

392
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,200
As much as you can.

393
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,200
Yes.

394
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,200
By eating soba.

395
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,200
I see.

396
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,200
Then please tell me.

397
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,200
Try to get out.

398
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,200
I'm trying to protect you from the heat.

399
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,200
Try to get out?

400
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,200
What are you going to do?

401
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:11,200
Try to get out.

402
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,200
It's a little strange.

403
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,200
What should I do?

404
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,200
Let's say it's coming.

405
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,200
A great heat.

406
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,200
Yes, yes, yes.

407
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,200
What's going to happen?

408
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,200
Please protect me.

409
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,200
As much as you can.

410
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:25,200
Please protect me as much as you can.

411
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:28,200
It's not a big deal.

412
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:31,200
What do you want to protect?

413
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,200
What do you want to protect?

414
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,200
Where do you want to protect?

415
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,200
It's all over the place.

416
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,200
It's all over the place.

417
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,200
Where do you want to protect?

418
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:41,200
Find some points.

419
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,200
Then like this.

420
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:49,200
You're melting.

421
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:55,200
Nothing feels good.

422
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,200
What are you doing?

423
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,200
What's wrong?

424
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,200
First of all, you have to protect your eyes.

425
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,200
Eyes?

426
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,200
If you don't protect your eyes, you'll be in trouble.

427
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,200
I'll put it on my face.

428
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,200
No, no, no.

429
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:07,200
You don't know.

430
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,200
No, no, no.

431
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:12,200
If your fingers can withstand the heat, no one will have a hard time.

432
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,200
That's right.

433
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,200
This is melting.

434
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,200
There's nothing you can do about it.

435
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,200
So think about protecting the whole thing.

436
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,200
What do you want me to do?

437
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,200
What?

438
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,200
What do you want me to do?

439
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,200
What kind of question is that?

440
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:29,200
I can't get out of the New Year mood.

441
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,200
It's the same as usual.

442
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,200
I don't even feel like answering.

443
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,200
What do you want me to do?

444
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:41,200
It's a little inside out.

445
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:49,200
The heat is going to run away.

446
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,200
It's in the middle.

447
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,200
It's in the middle.

448
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:59,200
First of all, you have to think about separating the heat.

449
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,200
That's right.

450
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,200
That's right.

451
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,200
Do you want to hear it?

452
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,200
Yes, yes.

453
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,200
I don't like it.

454
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,200
What are you talking about?

455
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,200
I'm listening.

456
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,200
Really?

457
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,200
Yes.

458
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,200
It's a little inside out.

459
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,200
Raise your armpit.

460
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,200
Why?

461
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:18,200
It's better to burn your armpit hair.

462
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:23,200
It's the other way around.

463
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:30,200
That's right.

464
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,200
Stop it.

465
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:37,200
This is a question for Mr. Mazumoto, who ate rice in a kappa plate.

466
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:45,200
Didn't the kappa get angry when the plate was taken?

467
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,200
What do you mean?

468
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,200
What do you think the kappa plate looks like?

469
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:52,200
I've only seen it in the manga.

470
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:55,200
It looks like a real plate is on it.

471
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,200
Do you think it's stuck to your body?

472
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,200
That's right.

473
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,200
That's what you think, right?

474
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,200
Yes.

475
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,200
It's actually just on it.

476
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,200
It's just on it?

477
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,200
That's right.

478
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:07,200
What is a kappa plate like?

479
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,200
I don't know.

480
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:11,200
It's like...

481
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,200
It's not like a plate that breaks when you drop it, is it?

482
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,200
No, it's like that.

483
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:19,200
It's more like a kappa plate than that.

484
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,200
Is that so?

485
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,200
Rather.

486
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:26,200
It's more like a kappa plate than that.

487
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,200
It's like that.

488
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,200
Is that so?

489
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,200
It's just on it.

490
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:36,200
If you think of it as a part of your body, you're wrong.

491
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:40,200
In a sense, a kappa is a plate.

492
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:43,200
It's also called a plate.

493
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,200
If you think of it as a plate.

494
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,200
If you think of it as a plate.

495
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,200
That's right.

496
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:55,200
After I finished eating, the kappa was giving me highlights.

497
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,200
It was sour.

498
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:02,200
If you think of it as a star, it's a yotsuboshi.

499
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,200
Who?

500
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,200
The kappa.

501
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,200
This store.

502
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,200
I see.

503
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,200
That's what he said.

504
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:19,200
At that time, I went and took a picture, but I didn't notice it for a while.

505
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,200
I looked at it again.

506
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,200
What?

507
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,200
I looked at it again.

508
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,200
Hey, why?

509
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,200
That's when I finally noticed it.

510
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,200
I said, I'm sorry.

511
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,200
That's why I'm not angry.

512
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,200
I see.

513
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:32,200
But I'm really angry.

514
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,200
It's not like I'm going to die because I caught it.

515
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,200
It's not like that.

516
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,200
I'm just angry.

517
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,200
I see.

518
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,200
I think it's a feeling of being hit by a talent.

519
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:47,200
It's okay, but...

520
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:52,200
I'm angry.

521
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,200
It's just on it.

522
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,200
It's just on it.

523
00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:03,200
I put a double-sided tape on it.

524
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,200
You didn't put it on.

525
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,200
What are you doing?

526
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:11,200
I'm going to fall.

527
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,200
It's getting weirder.

528
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:20,200
I'm still being chased.

529
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,200
Did you return it?

530
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,200
I didn't return it.

531
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,200
You didn't return it?

532
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,200
I didn't return it.

533
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,200
Did you take it home?

534
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,200
I took it home.

535
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,200
So I'm still coming.

536
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,200
Kappa?

537
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,200
Kappa.

538
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,200
Return it.

539
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,200
I see.

540
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,200
Return it.

541
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,200
If it's like this, it's Iji.

542
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,200
It's a fight between Iji and Iji.

543
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,200
It's his problem.

544
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:47,200
It's not him.

545
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,200
It's Kappa.

546
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,200
What's wrong with Iji?

547
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,200
I'm angry.

548
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,200
I feel like I lost.

549
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,200
What's wrong with Iji?

550
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,200
You took it yourself, didn't you?

551
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,200
That's right.

552
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,200
You should have returned it.

553
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,200
I feel like I lost.

554
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,200
Why did you do it?

555
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:04,200
I was angry because I thought I was scared.

556
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,200
What?

557
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:10,200
If I return it, he'll definitely say it's home.

558
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:15,200
When I said it, he was scared and returned it.

559
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,200
That's right.

560
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:19,200
I understand that.

561
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,200
Do you understand that feeling?

562
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,200
I understand that.

563
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,200
I don't return it.

564
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,200
I don't return it.

565
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,200
I don't know what he'll say.

566
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,200
I'll definitely scold him.

567
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,200
I'll scold Kappa.

568
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:35,200
I want to give him something different.

569
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,200
I see.

570
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,200
I see.

571
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:41,200
Like a dumpling.

572
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:45,200
I don't know what to do with a small dumpling.

573
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,200
I don't know if he'll accept it.

574
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:53,200
