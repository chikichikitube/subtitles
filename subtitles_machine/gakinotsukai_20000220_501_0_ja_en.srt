1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The second trial

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:08,000
From now on, we will begin the second trial, the light trial.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Now, the judges, judges, and the jury, please enter the court.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Now, the judges, judges, and the jury, please enter the court.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Now, the judges, judges, and the jury, please enter the court.

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The defendant, Saito Toshihide.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Not only as the chief director of Gaki no Tsukai,

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
but also as the chief editor of Gaki no Tsukai, he has created a lot of laughs,

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
but his true nature is that he is a very timid person,

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
such as a coward, a liar, and causes a lot of trouble to people.

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Therefore, he was sentenced to a light trial and was sentenced to a sentence of imprisonment,

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
but he still seems to be without showing any signs of regret.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
This time, he will be put on trial again.

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
From now on, we will begin the second trial, the light trial.

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Mr. Onuma, who is over there, will be put on trial again.

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I would like to make a declaration here.

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Is that so?

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Before that, I wanted to say something.

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
The chief judge.

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Actually, I came here by bus today.

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
The third trial, Mr. Onuma Akihiro will be put on trial again.

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:38,000
However, this time, the second trial, the light trial will be put on trial.

23
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
This program is provided by the sponsor you are watching.

24
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Prosecutor Hamada, please present the evidence.

25
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Yes, this time as well, as in the last time,

26
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,000
we are doing a VTR of various evil deeds of Heipo.

27
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
First of all, please take a look at this.

28
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
This is an incident in the rehearsal of a local program produced by Heipo.

29
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I would like to start the rehearsal.

30
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Mr. Shomei, are you ready?

31
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I'm ready at any time.

32
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Then, let's start the rehearsal.

33
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
First, two MCs will appear.

34
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
And then,

35
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
the rehearsal will proceed smoothly.

36
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I'm late again. I'm sorry.

37
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
But suddenly,

38
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
What is this? This dark Shomei.

39
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I can't record a TV program like this.

40
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
This is the reason why the MC is always a minor.

41
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Who is the person in charge of Shomei?

42
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Whether he appears or not, Heipo is angry with the darkness of Shomei.

43
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
You?

44
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Why is the Shomei so dark?

45
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
No, it's the same as usual.

46
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
That's not true.

47
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
My eyes are not a hole in the wall.

48
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
It's dark. It's completely dark.

49
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Heipo, who gets angry with more energy,

50
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
and at that time, there is only one AD.

51
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Um, Saito-san?

52
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Sunglasses...

53
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Sunglasses?

54
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
It's bright.

55
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,000
It turns out that Heipo was angry with the darkness of Shomei through the sunglasses.

56
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Yes, yes, yes, shall we go to the main show?

57
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
He is the worst man.

58
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Now, the judge, there is a witness about this.

59
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I understand.

60
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
The witness, please come in.

61
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Nakamura Yoshinobu.

62
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Um, the AD found the sunglasses.

63
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Well, he knew it.

64
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
However, as usual, he laughs and deceives.

65
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
There is no apology.

66
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
And Shomei-san was a little angry.

67
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
That's why.

68
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
We went and apologized next to him.

69
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
This glass was expensive.

70
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
What is that?

71
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

72
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
This is the second trial.

73
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Don't mess with me.

74
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Well, that's true.

75
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
What I want to say is that such a thing,

76
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
why do you wear sunglasses?

77
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Basically.

78
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Basically.

79
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
It's not a talent.

80
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
It's not a skill.

81
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
It's not a skill.

82
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
But it's ugly.

83
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
It's a small man.

84
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
It's ugly.

85
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
It's ugly.

86
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
There is a reaction.

87
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Actually, the recording of this local song was done in Alta.

88
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Then there was a young girl down there.

89
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
She was stabbed in the face.

90
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Really?

91
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
It's ugly.

92
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
It's annoying.

93
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Do you believe it?

94
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
It's annoying.

95
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Really?

96
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
It's true.

97
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Well, Yoshinobu said it,

98
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:13,000
but if you wear sunglasses and notice that you made a mistake,

99
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I'm sorry.

100
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I forgot.

101
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
You can make an apology.

102
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I said this in the last trial.

103
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
You can't change what the director said.

104
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
You're completely wrong.

105
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
You're wrong as a person.

106
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
It depends on who it is.

107
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
The belief is...

108
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
That's the same thing.

109
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Let's watch the next VTR.

110
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,000
A staff came to the cabaret at the end of a certain program.

111
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
There was also a figure of TETSURO DEGAWA.

112
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Then HEIPO was there.

113
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
We are the treasure of the staff.

114
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
We can't make a program without a talent.

115
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
We are the staff with talent.

116
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
No way.

117
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I'm ready to do anything for you.

118
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Don't worry.

119
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,000
For some reason, HEIPO said he was passionate about his talent.

120
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
And the show ended.

121
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
DEGAWA, come here.

122
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
And then...

123
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
It's DEGAWA.

124
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
It's really DEGAWA.

125
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
DEGAWA is here.

126
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,000
A group of bad-looking young people came to DEGAWA.

127
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Do something.

128
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Hey, you guys.

129
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Let's talk.

130
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
DEGAWA's manager tried to stop them.

131
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
But...

132
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Shut up.

133
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
It's not a big deal.

134
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:58,000
A group of young people came to DEGAWA.

135
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Help me.

136
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
DEGAWA was in a big trouble.

137
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:08,000
But the staff tried to protect DEGAWA.

138
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
But HEIPO said...

139
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Hey, taxi.

140
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:21,000
He stopped the taxi and went back to the hotel.

141
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Really?

142
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
There is a violent incident.

143
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
It's scary at night.

144
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
It's really bad.

145
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,000
After that incident, I asked Yamada-kun.

146
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Yamada-kun tried to help me.

147
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
But he was stopped by SAITO-san.

148
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
He said, don't get involved. Let's run away.

149
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
And then he got on a taxi and ran away.

150
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I'm disappointed in him.

151
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
And the other thing is...

152
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I think all the talents are in trouble.

153
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
When I go to an edgy bar...

154
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I want to go, but I use a talent's name.

155
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
DEGAWA wants to go.

156
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
We're in trouble.

157
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
If you really want to go, use your own money.

158
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Please go alone.

159
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Please.

160
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Do you admit the truth?

161
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I admit the truth.

162
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
That's the worst.

163
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Why are you laughing?

164
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
What do you mean?

165
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Please tell us.

166
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Because it's scary.

167
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
That's the worst.

168
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
When I stopped the taxi...

169
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I wanted to get Tetsu-chan on the taxi as soon as possible.

170
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
If you do that, the scary guy will chase you.

171
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Do you understand what I'm saying?

172
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I don't understand.

173
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
This is the story when Heipo went to Osaka.

174
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

175
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I came to Osaka.

176
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Do you know there's a good cabaret in Osaka?

177
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I heard that the number one there is really cute.

178
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Really?

179
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:24,000
After all, a director has to be with a good woman.

180
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Let's all go together.

181
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Heipo, who had been wanting to make a girlfriend in Osaka for a long time,

182
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
appointed her as his girlfriend as soon as he entered the store.

183
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Number one, please.

184
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
And the woman who was appointed sat next to him.

185
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I'm Saito, a child care worker from Tokyo.

186
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
As expected, number one is cute.

187
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I've been to Osaka twice a month, so I look forward to working with you.

188
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Heipo liked her very much, but after a while...

189
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Ai-chan, I've got an order.

190
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I'm sorry, I was called.

191
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
The popular girl left the seat immediately.

192
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Then Heipo...

193
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Number one, please.

194
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
He appointed her.

195
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I can only be number one.

196
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I hope you don't come soon.

197
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Sorry to keep you waiting.

198
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I'm Saito, a child care worker from Tokyo.

199
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I've been to Osaka twice a month, so I look forward to working with you.

200
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Ai-chan, I've got an order.

201
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I'm sorry, I was called.

202
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Again?

203
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
You're as busy as me.

204
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Saito-san, shouldn't you appoint someone else?

205
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
What are you talking about?

206
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I'm number one in Tokyo.

207
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Number two doesn't match me.

208
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I'm sorry.

209
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Number one, please.

210
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Heipo called her back several times after she left the seat.

211
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
But after that...

212
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Ai-chan, that customer is calling you again.

213
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Again?

214
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
This is the fifth time.

215
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Heipo didn't even notice that the girl was bothering her.

216
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Number one, please.

217
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I'll appoint her.

218
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Understood.

219
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Please appoint her.

220
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Okay.

221
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I've been to Osaka once every two weeks.

222
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I go there with Saito-san.

223
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:44,000
At that time, I was asked who the number one was.

224
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
So I came.

225
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
At that point, I was like Onogori-san.

226
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I came, I came, I came.

227
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Wait, why are you all so good?

228
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
We're all good, right?

229
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
If you can't do that, you can't be a staff.

230
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I heard a loud voice from around me.

231
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
When you go to a store like that and stand there,

232
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
you say that you wanted to be there more, right?

233
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
That it was fun.

234
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I see, I see.

235
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
But I don't have time for that.

236
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
So I repeat it over and over again.

237
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
So when I look around me,

238
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I can see that the third time around,

239
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
the girl is a bit attracted to me.

240
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
That's right.

241
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Are you misunderstanding?

242
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I don't know.

243
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Hikoku.

244
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Yes.

245
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Don't you notice it yourself?

246
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
That you're attracted to her.

247
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
No, I'm not attracted to her.

248
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Do you only like the number one?

249
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
After all, there's a difference, right?

250
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Difference.

251
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
In that sense,

252
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
if it's a girl like this, it doesn't suit her.

253
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Where does your confidence come from?

254
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
That's why soap is good.

255
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Yes.

256
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
If you like the number one, it suits you.

257
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Yes, yes, yes.

258
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
But soap is not interesting.

259
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
So-called.

260
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
You don't like soap very much?

261
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
No, I went to the 20s a lot,

262
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
but about twice a week.

263
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I think that's a lot.

264
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
At that time.

265
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
It's more than a piano class.

266
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
It's really thin.

267
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
It's not thin.

268
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Is it still a fuzoku?

269
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
That's a story from a dozen years ago,

270
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
when Keipo went to fuzoku with Suga.

271
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Yes, yes, yes.

272
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
It's refreshing.

273
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
After all, fuzoku is good.

274
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I work hard and play with my cute sister.

275
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I'll get to Vector Myoujin.

276
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Right, Gass?

277
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Yes.

278
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
But today's child was cute.

279
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I gave her a name card without thinking.

280
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
What?

281
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Did you give her a name card?

282
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
What are you doing?

283
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
A name card is not just an individual thing.

284
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
It's a sacred thing as a journalist.

285
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
You can't give it to her.

286
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

287
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Recently, Vector Myoujin will soon be in the industry,

288
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
so please proceed with caution.

289
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Please.

290
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
And the next week.

291
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
You did a good job today.

292
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Gass, let's go play.

293
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Speaking of Heipo's play, of course, fuzoku.

294
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,000
The two who got a job came to the fuzoku store as usual.

295
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Welcome.

296
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Is the customer going home from work?

297
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Yes.

298
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
What kind of work are you doing?

299
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
It's a TV relationship.

300
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Wow, that's cool.

301
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Then, do you know this person?

302
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
He seems to be a pretty famous person.

303
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
The person who was offered in front of the store was Heipo's name card.

304
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
While saying such a great thing,

305
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Heipo was handing out name cards at various stores.

306
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
My name is Saito.

307
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Then, the most difficult one.

308
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
The witness.

309
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I understand.

310
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
The witness, please enter.

311
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
That's a manga.

312
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
This is the current VTR.

313
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
The first witness, Mr. Suga.

314
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Yes.

315
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
This is also pretty cool.

316
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
This is not the current VTR, but the name card incident.

317
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Yes.

318
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
It's the same as before.

319
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Really,

320
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
that person is not a journalist.

321
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
That's why you're not a director G-man Ichi.

322
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
That's what I was told.

323
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
If you're told that, you'll die, right?

324
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Yes, that's right.

325
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Heipo, I'm sorry,

326
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
but the other day,

327
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
the place I went to yesterday,

328
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
your name card was there.

329
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
What do you mean?

330
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
No, it's important to be a director first.

331
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
It seems that he's in the jail.

332
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
That's the worst.

333
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I don't understand.

334
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
What do you mean?

335
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
What's your reaction?

336
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
People's talk makes me angry.

337
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Somehow.

338
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
So I don't want to make it so.

339
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Especially around me.

340
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
You're giving it to people, right?

341
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
You want to have a good name, right?

342
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I say it with a face that I'm good at.

343
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I was very angry.

344
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
So I just said, why are you giving me a name card?

345
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
But if you're giving it to me, you've had a good name, right?

346
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I'm good.

347
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
It's strange.

348
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Because when it started,

349
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I said, let's go to Seikan.

350
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I don't feel like getting on.

351
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
When the door closed,

352
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I heard the sound of a pink rotor.

353
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Here you go.

354
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
One night,

355
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Heipo was drinking and walking alone.

356
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,000
He was so excited.

357
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Then...

358
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Ouch!

359
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Who are you to play with me like this?

360
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I'm sorry.

361
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Where are you looking at?

362
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I'm Heipo, the servant of a kid.

363
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
What are you going to do if I get hurt?

364
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
That's why I don't like it.

365
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
As soon as he realized that he was weaker than him,

366
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Heipo, who started shouting like a thief,

367
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,000
left the scene without realizing that he had lost his name card.

368
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
And the next day,

369
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Heipo got a call on his cell phone.

370
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Hello.

371
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
It's Saito.

372
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Are you Saito, the servant of a kid?

373
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Yes.

374
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
What can I do for you?

375
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,000
It seems that you gave a big discount to my acquaintance last night.

376
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
What? Last night?

377
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Yeah!

378
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I'm going to go over there now and make you pay for it.

379
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Wait for me.

380
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
What?

381
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
No, please don't.

382
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Suddenly, Suga appeared on Heipo's phone.

383
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Hey, Heipo, what's wrong?

384
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Mom, I'm in trouble.

385
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Heipo told Suga about what happened.

386
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Heipo said it was okay.

387
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
If you think it's okay, tell me.

388
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Ah, I'm going to change my new friend, Suga.

389
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
What?

390
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Heipo, who couldn't say a word,

391
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
suddenly put his cell phone on Suga's phone.

392
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Suga said,

393
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Hey, don't be so sad over the phone.

394
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
If you're coming, please come.

395
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I don't care if it's right now.

396
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Ah, Gas.

397
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
If you say that, you'll really come.

398
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
What are you going to do?

399
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
After that, Heipo...

400
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Excuse me.

401
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Please knock.

402
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Heipo, who screamed and was scared by a little sound,

403
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:02,000
called Suga and Kobayashi and asked them to be his bodyguards for three days and two nights.

404
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
I did something stupid.

405
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Let's do it one more time.

406
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
The witness, please come in.

407
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I'm Kobayashi, who appeared in V.

408
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Yes, yes, yes.

409
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Suga was there, too.

410
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Bodyguards.

411
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
The two of us.

412
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Yes, yes, yes.

413
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
So, how was it?

414
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,000
It was a little bit like a big brother on the outside.

415
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Otomo was an AD at the time.

416
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Heipo in the editing room said,

417
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Excuse me.

418
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
He took the tea and said,

419
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
What are you doing?

420
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
What kind of education are you giving to your parents?

421
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Knock on the door.

422
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Next time I knocked, I knocked again.

423
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
What are you knocking?

424
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
There's no way he'd come to the company.

425
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
I'm scared of the sound.

426
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I thought a man came.

427
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I just knocked on the door.

428
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
That day, Kobayashi and I came to the company by car.

429
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
He said,

430
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I'm scared, I'm so scared, so please stay with me.

431
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Let's go for a drink.

432
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I and Kobayashi said,

433
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Let's drink and go home by taxi.

434
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
We went for a drink.

435
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Kobayashi and I were drinking.

436
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
He kept silent for about 30 minutes.

437
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
He said,

438
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I'm scared, I'm so scared.

439
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
He said,

440
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Heipo, it's okay, let's just drink.

441
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Suddenly, like the part before,

442
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
He bowed his head and said,

443
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:22,000
You've done something stupid, haven't you?

444
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Me and Kobayashi said,

445
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Let's go home that day.

446
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
It's okay.

447
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
He said,

448
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
No, I'll definitely attack you.

449
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Forcibly, he took me to a capsule hotel in Akasaka.

450
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
He said,

451
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
If you come, I'll go to the middle bed.

452
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Please surround me with Kobayashi and sleep.

453
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
I'm so scared.

454
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Did you say something to the person you hit?

455
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
That's right.

456
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:57,000
I was a weak guy, so I thought I could win.

457
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
I think I said a lot.

458
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
He kept apologizing.

459
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
What happened at the end?

460
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,000
I said what I wanted to say, so I let him go home.

461
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
What happened after that?

462
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
After that, Kobayashi was dragged away.

463
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I was with him for three days and nights.

464
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Please don't leave me alone.

465
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
I was with him all the time.

466
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I thought it would be bad if I didn't go home on the fourth day.

467
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
I'm sorry I'm leaving today.

468
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
When I said that, Saito said,

469
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Then I'll go home, too.

470
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
I can't help it, so I'll send you home.

471
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Why are you angry?

472
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
I went to the side of the house.

473
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I always walk from there.

474
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,000
I'm sorry, but there's a suspicious person around the house.

475
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Is there a car? Can you take a look?

476
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
I went to see him.

477
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Who is Saito?

478
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
It's okay.

479
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
You can go in.

480
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
He's making a big fuss.

481
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
What's wrong?

482
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,000
A dog happened to pass by.

483
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
You're a dog.

484
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
You can't get out of the earth.

485
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:08,000
I found the person who called me.

486
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Please come in.

487
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Are you Saito?

488
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Yes.

489
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
You're my friend.

490
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
I'll beat you up.

491
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
You're making a big fuss.

492
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Yes.

493
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
What is it?

494
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Please forgive me.

495
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,000
You're watching someone else's game.

496
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
I'm sorry.

497
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
It's okay.

498
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Please forgive me.

499
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
You're making a big fuss.

500
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
I'm scared.

501
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Please come in.

502
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
He's making a big fuss.

503
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
He's making a big fuss.

504
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
He's making a big fuss.

505
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
He's making a big fuss.

506
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
He's making a big fuss.

507
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
The defendant, Sougen.

508
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,000
I'll tell you the truth.

509
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
He's guilty.

510
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
That's right.

511
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Everyone is very angry about this crime.

512
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:26,000
I couldn't laugh at the mini-prank.

513
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:55,000
The next day.

514
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:00,000
The victim was found dead.

515
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
The victim was found dead.

516
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:08,000
The victim was found dead.

517
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,000
The victim was found dead.

518
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:19,000
This program was provided by the following sponsors.
