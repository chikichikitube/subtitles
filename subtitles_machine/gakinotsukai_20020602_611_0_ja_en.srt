1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Who was it last time?

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
License.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
License. You've been talking about your license for a long time.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Ah, really?

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I really thought you should get a license.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
This program is brought to you by these sponsors.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
What is it? Did something happen?

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I don't want to watch TV anymore.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Why?

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
The World Cup is over.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm not interested at all.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I don't care.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I'm not interested in anything.

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I'm not going to watch it.

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'm not going to watch it even if it's 1mm.

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
There aren't many people who are interested in it.

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
But...

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
It's just that time.

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
But you'll watch it anyway, right?

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I can't watch it.

21
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Your face is like a fool.

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I don't care about my face.

23
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
But you won't watch it, right?

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I won't watch it.

25
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
It can't be helped.

26
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Goal!

27
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
What?

28
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I don't care about that.

29
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I don't care about that at all.

30
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Ah, you scored a goal, right?

31
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
No, no, no.

32
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Goal means the end.

33
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Right?

34
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
No.

35
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
It's so difficult that no one watches it.

36
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Goal!

37
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Shut up!

38
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'll eat, sleep, and take a bath.

39
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I don't care about the goal.

40
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I don't care about the time.

41
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I don't care.

42
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I don't care about that.

43
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
If you really want to score a goal, you should have done it now.

44
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
You should have scored a goal now.

45
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
But then...

46
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
You'll score a lot of goals now.

47
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Even if I do that, I'll just be a fool.

48
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I'll talk about it after my opponent scores a goal.

49
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
It doesn't matter.

50
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
What do you mean?

51
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Shouldn't the people who came from overseas accept that?

52
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Well, since it's an international tournament, they should provide a practice room.

53
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Is there any benefit in doing that?

54
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
What do you mean?

55
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Doesn't that mean people will come?

56
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
But you've been to so many places, and you've been to so many places at the same time.

57
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
There's no way that the village itself will get excited.

58
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
No, it's just the village that gets excited.

59
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
What?

60
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
The radius...

61
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
How many meters?

62
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Cameroon...

63
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
How many kilometers?

64
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Cameroon, huh?

65
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
You're late.

66
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Do you know why?

67
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I saw it on the news.

68
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
It's about money, right?

69
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
It's like a joke.

70
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
You came on a cheap plane because you wanted money, so you were late, right?

71
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Is that so?

72
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
That's what they say.

73
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
They say that direct flights cost a lot of money.

74
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:48,000
But you wanted to save money, so you went on a cheap tour.

75
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
You came from the outside.

76
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
You made a lot of money.

77
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I didn't know that.

78
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
The villagers were making money, but you were late.

79
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
You're late, but you're not a good person either.

80
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
It's the same with you.

81
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Slowly, slowly, something came up.

82
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
It's the opposite, isn't it?

83
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
It's the same with you.

84
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
You know how Cameroon feels, don't you?

85
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I know exactly how Cameroon feels.

86
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
That's weird.

87
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
It's okay.

88
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I won't see it.

89
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
How are you doing lately?

90
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
It's an old story, but there was another one.

91
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
What is it?

92
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Choja Banzuke.

93
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I looked into it in detail.

94
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:57,000
You have about 20 million yen more than me.

95
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I think you've got a little bit of it, but you're going to get 10 million yen, aren't you?

96
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
You're not going to put it in the envelope when you get back to school, are you?

97
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Wait a minute.

98
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
What is it?

99
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
It's not a ostrich club.

100
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Ostriches are all the same.

101
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
What is it?

102
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
What are you talking about?

103
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
What is it?

104
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Is it weird?

105
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

106
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Well, let me ask you.

107
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Yeah.

108
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Last year, you were higher than me.

109
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Was that how it was?

110
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Yes.

111
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I'm sorry.

112
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Yeah.

113
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
That's when I was a pretender.

114
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I have my own way of thinking.

115
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I don't do that kind of thing.

116
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
That's your style.

117
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
That's my style.

118
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Then I won't do it either.

119
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
What style?

120
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I won't do it either.

121
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Why?

122
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Then, what is it?

123
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
What are you talking about?

124
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
You see...

125
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Yes, yes, yes.

126
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
The one who hasn't come out yet is Paul, right?

127
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
No, he's here.

128
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Why hasn't he come out yet?

129
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
No, that's...

130
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I don't know.

131
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
That's just...

132
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Every day is the final answer.

133
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I don't know what you mean.

134
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I don't know what you mean.

135
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I don't know what you mean.

136
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I don't know what you mean.

137
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
But I'm sure you know what a combination is.

138
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
For example, when you were a rookie,

139
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
you won the rookie award,

140
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
or the celebrity award,

141
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
or the amateur celebrity award.

142
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
You did it properly.

143
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Properly.

144
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
In the true sense, you two did it properly.

145
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I won't forget it.

146
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
When I was an amateur celebrity,

147
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I won a prize of 50,000 yen.

148
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
He gave me a trophy.

149
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
When you win a trophy or a medal,

150
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
when you win a rookie award,

151
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
you don't give a trophy.

152
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I was like,

153
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Oh, thank you.

154
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
And when I won a prize of hundreds of thousands of yen,

155
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I was like,

156
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Oh, thank you.

157
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
And then,

158
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
in the dressing room,

159
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I was like,

160
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Oh, thank you.

161
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Why?

162
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
And I was like...

163
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Why?

164
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I was like this.

165
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Like this and this.

166
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Why?

167
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I was like this.

168
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I was like this,

169
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
and I was like this.

170
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
You're annoying.

171
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I was like,

172
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I don't want to blame you.

173
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
No, that's wrong.

174
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
What's wrong?

175
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
No, you're wrong.

176
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
What's wrong?

177
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
No, that's...

178
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
So, what if you do that from this year?

179
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
What if next year...

180
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
It's from this year.

181
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
It's from this year.

182
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
It's from this year.

183
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
If it's a new song next year,

184
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
it's from this year.

185
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
What about the announcement from last year?

186
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Oh, that's fine.

187
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I'll do that from last year.

188
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Why?

189
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
That's weird.

190
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
In exchange,

191
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
if something happens to me in the future,

192
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
and I go like this,

193
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
and you're really like this in the park,

194
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
if I only take the radio and the dog with me...

195
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
What is it?

196
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
What year is that?

197
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Even if it's only the radio and the dog...

198
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
What year is that?

199
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
That means you're a dantai.

200
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
That's right.

201
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
That's why...

202
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I'll go to that park.

203
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
What year is that?

204
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I'll go to that park.

205
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
What year is that?

206
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
How many years has it been since you took the radio and the dog with you?

207
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Well, it's been two years.

208
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Two years?

209
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Two years?

210
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I won't be there in two years.

211
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
If I take the radio and the dog with me...

212
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
That's right.

213
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
That's right.

214
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I'll be an octopus by then.

215
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
But you'll be happy.

216
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
When you take the radio and the dog with you,

217
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I'll fly from an airplane.

218
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
An airplane?

219
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
And then,

220
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I'll say,

221
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
You're downtown.

222
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
And then,

223
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I'll say,

224
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I'm glad we made a promise back then.

225
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I'm at the turning point right now.

226
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
If I give you 10 million yen here,

227
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
you'll have a lot of money in the future.

228
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Do you understand?

229
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
What are you talking about?

230
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
You should definitely do that.

231
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
You're talking nonsense.

232
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
It's 10 million yen.

233
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
No, that's not it.

234
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
That's weird.

235
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Why?

236
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
What's weird?

237
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I mean,

238
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I don't understand why you don't want to pay 10 million yen.

239
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
That's what I don't understand at all.

240
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Why?

241
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Because you have 20 million yen more than I do.

242
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
That's why I'm paying my taxes.

243
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
What do you mean?

244
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Taxes?

245
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
It can't be helped.

246
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
It can't be helped if you pay more taxes than I do.

247
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I have an idiotic family.

248
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
So,

249
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I have to feed my kids.

250
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I'm just getting in the way.

251
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
You're just getting in the way,

252
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
you're just getting in the way.

253
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
It's like you're polluting the Tetrapods.

254
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Where do you get that from?

255
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I don't know.

256
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
10 million yen?

257
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
You're saying I have 10 million yen here?

258
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
How many times do I have to tell you?

259
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
You'll get tired of hearing that.

260
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,000
When should I start sniffing the smell of the toilet paper?

261
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
There is, right? The one with the smell.

262
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Yes.

263
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Do you use that?

264
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Certainly, there is no need to smell it.

265
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
That's right.

266
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
It's because it has a smell.

267
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
It's because it has a smell.

268
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
It's not a smell that you can fool with that smell.

269
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Well, yes.

270
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
That's right.

271
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
So, there is no need to smell it, right?

272
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
What do you mean?

273
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
But you shouldn't smell it.

274
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
But the smell comes from smelling it, right?

275
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
It's not because you smell it.

276
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
You smell it because it has a smell, right?

277
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Huh?

278
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
No, it's not huh.

279
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
So, when you use it, do you smell it like this?

280
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
You don't smell it, right?

281
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Then, when should I smell it?

282
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Huh?

283
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
No, it's not huh. You know it.

284
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
So, it's poop, right?

285
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
No, just throw it away.

286
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Just throw it away.

287
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Just throw it away. It's too late at that stage.

288
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
It's before it's too late.

289
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
No, it's not.

290
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Don't say strange things even though you don't have 10 million yen.

291
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
It's not, right?

292
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,000
So, how should I say it?

293
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,000
For example, what is your favorite food?

294
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Yakisoba.

295
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
There is one more, right?

296
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Gyoza.

297
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
It's gyoza, right?

298
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Since you like gyoza and yakisoba, do you want to eat gyoza and yakisoba?

299
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
If there is one, I will eat it.

300
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Huh?

301
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
There is yakisoba inside the gyoza skin.

302
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Don't say it like that.

303
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
It's not like that, right?

304
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
If you add what you like, it will be twice as delicious.

305
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
This is a stupid way of thinking.

306
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
But there are times when it's the opposite.

307
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
If you add two things you don't like, it will be surprisingly good.

308
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I think this way of thinking is suitable for this.

309
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
What do you mean by that?

310
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
That toilet paper alone doesn't have a strong smell.

311
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:04,000
But when it's combined with the smell of poop...

312
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
It gives off a really good smell, right?

313
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
The smell of poop.

314
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Don't you have the courage to do that?

315
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Wipe my ass and bring it here.

316
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
You have a lot of courage.

317
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
That's why I don't like the smell.

318
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Try it.

319
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
This is...

320
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
This is...

321
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
This is that girl?

322
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Don't you think so?

323
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
That girl?

324
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
This is that girl who smells like the countryside?

325
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
What are you saying?

326
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Why are you laughing?

327
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
No, that's a mania.

328
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I'm happy about that.

329
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Okay, then try it.

330
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Really.

331
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Try it.

332
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:52,000
That's just tied to my past memories.

333
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I'm determined that the smell of poop is strong.

334
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
There are times when it smells strong.

335
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Yes, there are.

336
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I'm surprised.

337
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
What am I?

338
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
There are times when it smells strong.

339
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Yes, there are.

340
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
There are times when it smells strong.

341
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I'm thinking about the side that smells strong.

342
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
When I think about that, I definitely know that it smells strong.

343
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I can't bring it here.

344
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Try it.

345
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:20,000
It smells so strong that it can be used as a diaper.

346
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
What do you mean a diaper?

347
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
It's the air purifier of the entertainment world.

348
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I think I can use that.

349
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Is that so?

350
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Yes.

351
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:37,000
When you're inside the negative ion, how excited are you?

352
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:42,000
You're from Kyoto, right?

353
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
When you're inside the negative ion, how excited are you?

354
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,000
The negative ion is said to be very good.

355
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
You're talking about the momentum.

356
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
No, it's not like that.

357
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I don't understand the meaning of being excited.

358
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
What do you mean?

359
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I don't understand the meaning of being excited.

360
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
It's said that the negative ion makes people excited.

361
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Really?

362
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Yes.

363
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Don't you have a negative ion device at home?

364
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I don't have one.

365
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
People who work like this should have one.

366
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Really?

367
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
It's better to be excited than to be low.

368
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
That's right.

369
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
That's absolutely right.

370
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Do you have one at home?

371
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Yes, I do.

372
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
If you have one, you'll be very excited.

373
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
A lot of things change.

374
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Please tell me the details.

375
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
How does it feel?

376
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
The negative ion spreads widely.

377
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:40,000
When I go into the living room, I feel the negative ion.

378
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
There's a lot of negative ion coming in.

379
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000
It's coming in from the back of the room.

380
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:53,000
The negative ion is coming in through the gap.

381
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:59,000
The negative ion is coming in from the back of the room.

382
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
It's amazing.

383
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
It's coming in through the gap.

384
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Does that make you excited?

385
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Does that make you excited?

386
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
It's easy to get excited.

387
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
The negative ion is coming in through the gap.

388
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,000
It's coming in through the gap.

389
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I can feel the negative ion coming in.

390
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
That's how you get excited.

391
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I see.

392
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I think today's guest was too high-class.

393
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I don't know.

394
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I don't know if there's anyone here who has a machine.

395
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Is there anyone?

396
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I don't think there's anyone like you.

397
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
It's amazing.

398
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:53,000
There's a lot behind the TV.

399
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:58,000
There's a lot behind the curtains.

400
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,000
That's amazing.

401
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
It's really...

402
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
It's obvious.

403
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
There's a lot behind the curtains.

404
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
There's a lot behind the curtains.

405
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Hey!

406
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
It's scary.

407
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
There's a lot behind the curtains.

408
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I don't like wearing that.

409
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Really?

410
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Even if I'm wearing it, it looks like it.

411
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
The negative ion.

412
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Really?

413
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Nearby?

414
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Nearby.

415
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Because the room is full of negative ions.

416
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
That's right.

417
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Even when I'm screaming, the negative ion is coming in.

418
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
What's that?

419
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Director.

420
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Why is it like D?

421
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
The negative ion is coming in.

422
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Grimdor is a man who plays the flute.

423
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,000
When he plays the flute, all the rats in town gather around him.

424
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:04,000
When he hums that song, all the old and young people in town gather and dance.

425
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I heard that there's a magic trick in Matsumotsu-san's lyrics and music.

426
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:15,000
What kind of trick is that?

427
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:21,000
The staff of this show told me to change my phone number from time to time.

428
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Really?

429
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I told them not to say stupid things.

430
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
What?

431
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:32,000
You're just going to say that?

432
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
How about it?

433
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
But you've made a lot of them.

434
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I've made a lot of them.

435
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
But how about it?

436
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I think that's what we're going to do today.

437
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
What do you mean?

438
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
That's what we're going to do today.

439
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I'm going to change my phone number.

440
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Are you going to change it?

441
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Are you going to do it?

442
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
You're the one who's going to do it.

443
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
You're the one who's going to do it.

444
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
When I look back on the past, I feel like it was a long time ago.

445
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I see.

446
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Can it be shorter?

447
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Sure.

448
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
How do you want it to be?

449
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Isn't it going to be fun?

450
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Sure.

451
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
It's going to be fun.

452
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Sure.

453
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Please.

454
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Are you going to record it?

455
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I'm going to record it.

456
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Are you going to record it?

457
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Are you going to record it?

458
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
That's better.

459
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Let's change it from next week.

460
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Let's change it from next week.

461
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Everyone, be quiet when it starts.

462
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Can I?

463
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Sure.

464
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Can you help me?

465
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,000
You're the only one who's going to do it.

466
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:56,000
You're the only one who's going to do it.

467
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Is this okay?

468
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I told you to wrap the tape properly.

469
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Why?

470
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:09,000
It's hard to breathe.

471
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,000
I can't sing with this mic.

472
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
What kind of image do you want?

473
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
It says it's going to be fun.

474
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Everyone's going to dance.

475
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I understand.

476
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
That's fine.

477
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
There's something like that.

478
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Of course there is.

479
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
That's why I'm here right now.

480
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
You can sing it for a while.

481
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I can't sing it for a while.

482
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Let's go.

483
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Yes, please.

484
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Take it, Deshi.

485
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
It's a vegetable.

486
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
It's a fun feeling.

487
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
It's fun.

488
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I told you it's a fun feeling.

489
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
You're going to disband.

490
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
If it's a vegetable, I can't throw it away.

491
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I don't care.

492
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:06,000
How is it?

493
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
After that...

494
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
You should put the sound on the bass later, right?

495
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
That's right.

496
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Then play the whole song.

497
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I don't know what kind of song I want to sing.

498
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
You said you were going to join us.

499
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
What do you think this is?

500
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I'll put the sound on later.

501
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
You can sing in a cappella.

502
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Really?

503
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I'll make it fun.

504
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
I don't know the atmosphere yet.

505
00:19:35,000 --> 00:20:00,000
It's a sampling.
