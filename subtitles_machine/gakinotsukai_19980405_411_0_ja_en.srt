00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
This week, we'll be talking about one of the biggest unspoken secrets!

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:12,000
On the veranda, well, it's a mansion, but on the veranda of my house,

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
every night, recently, a cat comes.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
It's a black cat, but it's a great adult.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
It's a black cat?

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
A black cat comes to my house, and the black cat will look at it.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I feed it, but I don't have any cats, so I only feed it with katsuobushi.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
You live alone, and you have katsuobushi?

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Well, I have to take out a lot of things.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Don't make such a big deal out of it!

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Unfortunately, the front legs of the black cat are injured.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:55,000
You can say that cats are a little timid.

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I don't know if the front legs of the black cat were injured by humans.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I don't really know.

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
That's why it doesn't come to me from about one meter away.

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I try to get a little closer with the food, but it's still scared.

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I talk to it while laughing, but it's still scared.

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I want to catch it as soon as possible and take it to the hospital.

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Is it over?

20
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
When I say this, I feel like I'm talking to a very nice person.

21
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Say it quickly!

22
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
It's a long story.

23
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:47,000
In the end, what I wanted to say was that Matsumoto told everyone that there was such a place.

24
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
That's mean!

25
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
That's mean!

26
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
You don't have to say that!

27
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
So today, everyone went home and called their friends.

28
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Which do you think is kinder, Machan or Hama-chan?

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
First of all, listen to the story.

30
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I don't want to do it anymore.

31
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I killed a cat.

32
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I also killed a lot of animals.

33
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Who is the most popular man in Japan now?

34
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I think there are various opinions.

35
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Who do you think it is?

36
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Well, now...

37
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
The representative is Sorimachi, right?

38
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Yes, Sorimachi.

39
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Who else?

40
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:47,000
The person who appeared in the drama with me.

41
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Who is so strong?

42
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Who is it?

43
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Sorimachi and...

44
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Take no Uchi!

45
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Who else?

46
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Who else?

47
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Kimura Takuya.

48
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
What is Kimura Takuya?

49
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Do you think it's Kimura Takuya?

50
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
That's a big mistake.

51
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Let me tell you a good thing.

52
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
For example, there is a data of wanting to be hugged.

53
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
There is a little mistake or mystery of such data.

54
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I found it completely.

55
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
For example, there are the most people who say they like Kimura Takuya.

56
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
And the most popular is different.

57
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
It's just that there are the most people who say they like Kimura Takuya.

58
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
But it doesn't mean that Kimura Takuya is popular.

59
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
No, it doesn't.

60
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,000
There are also people who say they hate Kimura Takuya.

61
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I know that.

62
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
It means that the most popular is the top 10.

63
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
It doesn't mean that Kimura Takuya is popular.

64
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
No, it means that Kimura Takuya is the most popular.

65
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Even if you don't aim for the top 10, there are very few people who say they hate Kimura Takuya.

66
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I don't know about that.

67
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
But if you look at it simply,

68
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Everyone thinks that Kimura Takuya is popular because he is the most popular.

69
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Because he is the most popular.

70
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
That's the evaluation.

71
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
No one thinks that Kimura Takuya is the most popular.

72
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Then I'm the loser.

73
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I'm completely defeated.

74
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
You're completely defeated.

75
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
That's exactly right.

76
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
But I wonder if that's the case.

77
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
But if you look at it this way, people usually think that way.

78
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Is it that popular?

79
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Even if you say that, people will come to you even if you walk in the streets.

80
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
You'll say that, right?

81
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I'll definitely say that.

82
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
You're just saying that now.

83
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
If you see him on TV, you'll say that.

84
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I think so, too.

85
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
It's completely different from seeing a celebrity on TV.

86
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Even Katsura Kokinji is cool.

87
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
He's cooler than watching TV.

88
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
He's cooler than watching TV.

89
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
He's cooler than watching TV.

90
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
He has a small face.

91
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
But that's just a small face.

92
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I don't think he's cool.

93
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
He's cooler than watching TV.

94
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
That's not true.

95
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I don't care about that.

96
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I think that's true.

97
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
That's right.

98
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I think that's true.

99
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:38,000
There are so many people who say that they saw Downtown for the first time today.

100
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
That's true.

101
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I've been watching downtown on TV for the first time.

102
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I've never seen it live.

103
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
He's so cool.

104
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Is he?

105
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I only see you.

106
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
It's amazing.

107
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
He's so cool.

108
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I don't know which one is which.

109
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
That's what it means.

110
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I don't know if it's live.

111
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
And...

112
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
What is it?

113
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I don't like him.

114
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I don't like him.

115
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I don't like him.

116
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I don't like him.

117
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I don't like him.

118
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I don't like him.

119
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I don't like him.

120
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I have a bad image.

121
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I can go to a cafe and say,

122
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Hey, come on, come on, come on!

123
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
But when I say something,

124
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Thank you.

125
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Grab the apron while standing up!

126
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
What am I supposed to do?

127
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
What's the point?

128
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
That's where it starts.

129
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
But...

130
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Out of the 10 people here, almost 10 people,

131
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Machan is kinder than usual.

132
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
What's that?

133
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
That's a long story.

134
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
This is a question for Matsumoto-san, who bought a giraffe for his pet.

135
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I also want to buy a giraffe.

136
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
How do you take it for a walk?

137
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
And what kind of food do you feed it?

138
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Please tell me.

139
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I've seen this a lot.

140
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Where did you hear about it?

141
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
How big is it?

142
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
First of all, you don't have to check if you really bought it or not.

143
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
You believe in the letter and say that you bought it.

144
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
You've decided.

145
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Isn't that strange?

146
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
You have to ask me first if you bought it or not.

147
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I don't even know if I bought it or not.

148
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Why do you keep going alone?

149
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Is that wrong?

150
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Is that wrong?

151
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Does that mean you're not buying it?

152
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
First of all, do you buy it or not?

153
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I'm sorry.

154
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I heard that you bought a giraffe for your pet.

155
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Did you buy it?

156
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I bought it.

157
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I don't care.

158
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I don't care if you keep going.

159
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
There are many kinds of giraffes.

160
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
They're all called Kyurin.

161
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Kyurin?

162
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
It's a giraffe, isn't it?

163
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Well, it's easy for everyone to understand.

164
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
It's a giraffe.

165
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
There are many kinds of giraffes.

166
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
It looks like a giraffe.

167
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
What kind of giraffes are there?

168
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
It's not that everyone is big.

169
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
There are small ones.

170
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
There are such things.

171
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Everyone may have a water ball pattern.

172
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
It's not just that.

173
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
What kind of giraffe do you have?

174
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
What kind of giraffes are there?

175
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
What kind of pattern is it?

176
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Well...

177
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
How big is it?

178
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
If you put it in here, it's almost as big as the front.

179
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
If you put in the length of the neck, it will be like that.

180
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Actually...

181
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
This is a giraffe.

182
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I can still go.

183
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
No, no, no.

184
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
You have a neck.

185
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
No, no, no.

186
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Where do you buy it?

187
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Where do you buy it?

188
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
What do you mean?

189
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
You don't go inside the house, do you?

190
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I go inside.

191
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
It's all blown out.

192
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Is it expensive?

193
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
It's expensive.

194
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I see.

195
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Well, that's true.

196
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I'm taking a walk.

197
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
You're taking a walk.

198
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I'm taking a walk in the neighborhood.

199
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Well, in the neighborhood or around Shonan.

200
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
That's a Shonan animal.

201
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
No, it's not.

202
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
What do you do when you take a walk?

203
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
If it's a dog, you hold a chain.

204
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I see.

205
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
You can talk to it.

206
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
How do you take it?

207
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Well, most of the time...

208
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Where?

209
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
It's the face.

210
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
The face?

211
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
The face?

212
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
It's like this.

213
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Well, but...

214
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I'll talk to it here.

215
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
But it's hard for this guy to walk.

216
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Why?

217
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
It's like this.

218
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
But it's okay.

219
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
You don't know if it's okay or not.

220
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
What the hell?

221
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
What?

222
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
What?

223
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Why did you kick it barefoot?

224
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Matsumoto-san says he's good at telling stories.

225
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Matsumoto-san says he's good at telling stories.

226
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Well, yeah.

227
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Please tell me how to tell the next story.

228
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Okay.

229
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
When your friend cuts your hair and it doesn't look good on you.

230
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
It's not like I'm telling a story.

231
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
It's not like I'm telling a story.

232
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
It's not like I'm telling a story.

233
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
By the time I know the moment it's going to hold,

234
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Finished, I must already be looking forward to the next meeting with you guys.

235
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I swear it's a lie.

236
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I don't know about those kinds of stories.

237
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
When you say this, you can't say that you were it.

238
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
When you say this, you can't say that you were it.

239
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
That's how I say that I don't mean it.

240
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
That's how I say that I don't mean it.

241
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
It's how I greet people.

242
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
It's rude.

243
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I think I don't think it's rude any more

244
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I'm sure.

245
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
It's rude, isn't it?

246
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
No.

247
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
It's not rude at all.

248
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Oh, really?

249
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
It's like, I knew it.

250
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
There's no way it's like that.

251
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
It hurts.

252
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
No matter how you think about it.

253
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
It's like, I knew it.

254
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
It's rude to say it like that.

255
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Why is that?

256
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
It's like, are you underestimating me?

257
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I don't think it's like that.

258
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I'll tell you what's bad about the other person.

259
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I see.

260
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
What is it?

261
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
There are times when you cut your hair and it doesn't suit you, right?

262
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

263
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
When that happens, what do you say?

264
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
First of all, that hairstyle is weird.

265
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
But, but, you're like that.

266
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I like it too.

267
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
That's...

268
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
That's...

269
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
What kind of follow-up is that?

270
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
There's no follow-up at all.

271
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
What is it?

272
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Is it bad?

273
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Your friend's house is too small and dirty.

274
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Your house is too small and dirty.

275
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
What is this?

276
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
You can't just say it.

277
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Shut up and live in your own house.

278
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Shut up and live in your own house.

279
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
What kind of house is this?

280
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
But...

281
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I like this kind of girl.

282
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Your friend's father and mother have a bad relationship.

283
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Your friend's father and mother have a bad relationship.

284
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Your friend's father and mother have a bad relationship.

285
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
But...

286
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I like her.
