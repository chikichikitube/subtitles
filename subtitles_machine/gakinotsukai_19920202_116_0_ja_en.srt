1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
It's time for the children's game, Mokura-Tataki Game!

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
We're here at the cold sky.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Yes, it's cold.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
What is this cold sky?

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Mokura-Tataki.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Yes, I'm going to skip it.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
We're going to play a classic game called Mokura-Tataki.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I see.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
We're going to capture the hearts of children.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
From adults to children.

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I see.

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Let's go to the children's game.

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Go!

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Mokura!

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Go into the middle.

16
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
First, slide.

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
He slipped once.

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
What is Mokura?

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It's my name.

20
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
You're Mokura.

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
And you?

22
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm Kong.

23
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
He slipped twice.

24
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
From now on, each person will be adjusted.

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
We have a clock here for 30 seconds.

26
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
If you succeed three times out of ten, you win.

27
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
What do you mean by three times?

28
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
If you don't get hit four times, you win.

29
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
If you don't get hit three times, you win.

30
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
If you don't get hit four times, you win.

31
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
It's a wonderful game.

32
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Here it comes.

33
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
This is a gift.

34
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
What?

35
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
What?

36
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Who is it?

37
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Who is it?

38
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Why don't you do it?

39
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
This beat.

40
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Are you serious?

41
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Is this a beat?

42
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
No, it's not.

43
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
No, it's not.

44
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
This is a gift.

45
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Are you serious?

46
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Look at this.

47
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
There's something wrong with golf.

48
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
All right.

49
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Stop it.

50
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Stop it.

51
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Let's do it.

52
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
All right.

53
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I'll tell you something good.

54
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Both of you...

55
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
You should be on the show.

56
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I'll tell you something good.

57
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Both of you should be on the show.

58
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
All right.

59
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I'll do my best.

60
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
You should be on the show.

61
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Let's do it.

62
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
All right.

63
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Ready.

64
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Start.

65
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
One time.

66
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Two times.

67
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Three times.

68
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
You lose.

69
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I got hit three times.

70
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
No.

71
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
This is strange.

72
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Here it comes.

73
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Ready.

74
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Ready.

75
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Go.

76
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
What?

77
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
The end.

78
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
The end.

79
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
You have no talent.

80
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Do you want to make another chance?

81
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I don't know.

82
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I'm sorry.

83
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I'll do my best.

84
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I'm sure you can beat me.

85
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Can you hit me here?

86
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I can't move.

87
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Suya-san.

88
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
You'll get hurt.

89
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
This is a nuisance.

90
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Let's take this.

91
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
What are you doing?

92
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
This is a nuisance.

93
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I can see well.

94
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
What are you doing?

95
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
What are you doing?

96
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
What are you doing?

97
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
What are you doing?

98
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I'll give you a bottle.

99
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I'll give you a bottle.

100
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
What are you doing?

101
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Spit it out.

102
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Spit it out.

103
00:03:50,000 --> 00:04:09,000
The air is coming out.

104
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I'm busy.

105
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:33,000
This is a nuisance.

106
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I'll give you a bottle.

107
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I'm tired.

108
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I'll give you a bottle.

109
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I'm tired.

110
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
What do you think?

111
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Is this okay?

112
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Did you win?

113
00:04:47,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I'll kill you someday.

114
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Wait a minute.

115
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Is this a school trip bus?

116
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Is this a school trip bus?

117
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Do you want to sit in a bus?

118
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
There are many.

119
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
It's creepy.

120
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
It's creepy.

121
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
It's creepy.

122
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
It's creepy.

123
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Do you want to sit in a bus?

124
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
This is a band.

125
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
There was something to celebrate today, right?

126
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
There was something to celebrate today, right?

127
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I passed the exam today.

128
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
You're going to get in the car again, aren't you?

129
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:54,000
To be honest, I was relieved when you got in the car.

130
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Why?

131
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
You stole gasoline again.

132
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
You're going to commit a crime.

133
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
If I tell you the truth, I don't want you to get in the car.

134
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Are you stupid?

135
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
You're going to get in the car again, aren't you?

136
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,000
You're going to get in the car again, aren't you?

137
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Are you stupid?

138
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I've never had an accident when I was in front of you.

139
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
You're lying.

140
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Are you serious?

141
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
You were spinning in the high speed.

142
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
No, I'm not.

143
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
You were spinning in the high speed.

144
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
You were spinning in the high speed.

145
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
You were spinning in the high speed.

146
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Are you stupid?

147
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
You're going to get in the car again, aren't you?

148
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
What did you do once?

149
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
What's the thing that can break the tire?

150
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
The standing wave phenomenon.

151
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I got in the car.

152
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I was spinning in the high speed.

153
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Suddenly, I heard the sound of a helicopter.

154
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I thought it was strange.

155
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
The back of the car was shaking.

156
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I thought it was me.

157
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,000
The tire on the right side of the car was broken.

158
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
The rest of the tire was broken.

159
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Then I heard the sound of a helicopter.

160
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
The rest of the tire was broken.

161
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
It was a penguin toy.

162
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
There was such a thing, but there was no accident.

163
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Did you hook your grandmother?

164
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Have you ever cut your grandfather's Achilles tendon?

165
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Is your grandfather like this?

166
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Everyone is angry.

167
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
But your grandfather has a crack in his ear.

168
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Your grandfather suddenly stopped.

169
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I couldn't stop it.

170
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,000
My grandfather suddenly stopped.

171
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Because your Achilles tendon was broken.

172
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Because I don't have the strength to hold on.

173
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
It's strange.

174
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
You took a lot of time.

175
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
My grandfather said that.

176
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
My grandfather was 70 years old.

177
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I have the same age as my grandfather.

178
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,000
My grandfather challenged me for the third time.

179
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I was surprised.

180
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Did you challenge me again?

181
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I tried again the next day, but I couldn't do it.

182
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
If I fail today, I'll quit.

183
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
My grandfather was a little blue.

184
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
My grandfather was a little blue.

185
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I didn't say that.

186
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I've been driving for 70 hours.

187
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I didn't say that.

188
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I was watching him drive.

189
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I said, of course you are.

190
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,000
When I came out, my grandfather looked like this.

191
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I passed.

192
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I'm glad I passed.

193
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I'm glad I passed.

194
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I don't like it when I'm checked.

195
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I've been watching him drive for a long time.

196
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:10,000
My grandmother is the worst.

197
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
My grandmother is the worst.

198
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
My grandmother is the worst.

199
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
My grandmother is the worst.

200
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
My grandmother is the worst.

201
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Why are you stretching your neck?

202
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I'm fine.

203
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I'm stretching my neck.

204
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
My grandmother is the worst.

205
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
My grandmother is the worst.

206
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
My grandmother is the worst.

207
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
My grandmother is the worst.

208
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
My grandmother is the worst.

209
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Animals jump out.

210
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
There is a short-legged dog with brown hair.

211
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,000
It's like a big dog.

212
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,000
When I drove it, it jumped out.

213
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I thought it was a fried chicken.

214
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I thought so.

215
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I thought it was strange.

216
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I hit the car.

217
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I thought I would kill it.

218
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
It jumped out.

219
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
It jumped out.

220
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
It jumped out.

221
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
It jumped out.

222
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,000
It's like me.

223
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
It's true.

224
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:37,000
It's hard to drive a car.

225
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
When I got in the car, I had a stomachache.

226
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
You mean you want to throw up?

227
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Yes.

228
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
It's hard.

229
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
It's a one-way street.

230
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
It's very crowded.

231
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I have a stomachache.

232
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
It's like knocking on the entrance.

233
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Please get out of the car.

234
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,000
It came out of the keyhole.

235
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
If there was a door.

236
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
It came out smoothly.

237
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
It's hard.

238
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
It's hard.

239
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I want you to think about it.

240
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
It's like this.

241
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I understand.

242
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
It's like this with this hand.

243
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
It moves little by little.

244
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
But I can't step on the accelerator.

245
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,000
It's like this.

246
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
It's really like this.

247
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
The person next to you will be surprised.

248
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
It's like this next to you.

249
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
It's really like this.

250
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
But the front tire is like this.

251
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,000
It's really like this.

252
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
The front tire is like this.

253
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
It moves like this.

254
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
It's really like this.

255
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
It's really like this.

256
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
What is this?

257
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,000
There is a sauce on it.

258
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
It's hard.

259
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
This is human.

260
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Mix it.

261
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Take the sauce off.

262
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
It's hard.

263
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:23,000
It's hard.

264
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I have a question for you two.

265
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,000
What is in the head of Tetsuko Kuroyanagi?

266
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
What do you mean?

267
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
It doesn't look like hair.

268
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
There must be something in it.

269
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
What is in it?

270
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I don't know.

271
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I don't know.

272
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I don't know either.

273
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
What is in it?

274
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
It's like that.

275
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
It's like a treasure.

276
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
What is a treasure?

277
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,000
It's sweet.

278
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,000
You are a fool.

279
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
It's like a bag of sweets.

280
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
It's like a bag of sweets.

281
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
It's sweet.

282
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:18,000
It's like that.

283
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
It's like that.

284
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I went to drink with my friend and I lost my memory.

285
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
This is the first time.

286
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Have you ever drunk so much that you can't remember?

287
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
No.

288
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I drink so much that I can't remember.

289
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I remember when I was flirting with a girl at the club.

290
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Wait.

291
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
You took me to the past.

292
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
What?

293
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
You brought me here.

294
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I didn't bring you here.

295
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
What are you talking about?

296
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
You called me and came here.

297
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I called you.

298
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I'm coming.

299
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Then I'll bring you a girl.

300
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Why are you saying that?

301
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I didn't say that.

302
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,000
You are a fool.

303
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Wait.

304
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Someone help me.

305
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Please.

306
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Hey.

307
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
You brought me here.

308
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I didn't bring you here.

309
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I just followed you.

310
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
That's not true.

311
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I brought you here.

312
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I brought you here.

313
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:38,000
One of the four of us was drunk.

314
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I didn't drink.

315
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I thought you didn't have a memory.

316
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I didn't drink so much.

317
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I was singing all the time.

318
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
So you remember.

319
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I remember.

320
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
What do you mean?

321
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I don't remember what kind of strawberry talk we had.

322
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I didn't talk to her enough to have a strawberry talk.

323
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
What are you talking about?

324
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Stop it.

325
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Don't stretch your neck.

326
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Really?

327
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I'll tell you.

328
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I'll tell you.

329
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I'll tell you.

330
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I went home.

331
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I didn't do anything.

332
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I went home.

333
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I didn't do anything.

334
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I don't want to talk about that.

335
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I had a new year party the other day.

336
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
The vice president came.

337
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
The vice president of Japan TV.

338
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
His name is Matsumoto.

339
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Matsumoto, good job today.

340
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:45,000
And Horiguchi.

341
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
What?

342
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
That old man is strange.

343
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
He keeps saying Hama-chan.

344
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,000
And Horiguchi.

345
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Horiguchi even though he is Hama-chan.

346
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Horiguchi Hamaoka.

347
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
It was the same today.

348
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I went to Japan TV today.

349
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
The president gave me a letter of appreciation.

350
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
There were two letters at first.

351
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Hamada Masa.

352
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
It's called Masatoshi.

353
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
It's called Masatoshi.

354
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Matsumoto Hitoshi.

355
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I read it.

356
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I read the letter of appreciation.

357
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Matsumoto's letter of appreciation.

358
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Matsumoto Jinshi.

359
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
You read it at first.

360
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
You read it at the third time.

361
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Jinshi.

362
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
It's similar, isn't it?

363
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I'm really sorry, but that old man is stupid.

364
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Shock.

365
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Enemy.

366
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Telephone.

367
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Paco.

368
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Paco?

369
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
How many times do I want to hit my head?

370
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
It's strange, isn't it?

371
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
There are a lot of strange things.

372
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Recently, Matsumoto and Hama-chan often say it's tight.

373
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I found something tight at home.

374
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I found something tight.

375
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Please give me your opinion.

376
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
An umbrella made of an empty tobacco box.

377
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
It's tight.

378
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
The old man in the taxi.

379
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
It's hanging.

380
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
It's tight.

381
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
It's tight.

382
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:42,000
A cardboard box with Natsumo's father written on it.

383
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I'll forgive you for that.

384
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
It can't be helped.

385
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
It's written like that.

386
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
My father always wears my underwear.

387
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:59,000
It's my year's underwear.

388
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
It's your family's underwear.

389
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
It's my family's underwear.

390
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
It's my family's underwear.

391
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,000
My father always wears my underwear.

392
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:16,000
My father always wears my underwear.

393
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
It's written on the white brief.

394
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Father.

395
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
It's tight.

396
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I didn't have a bath at that time.

397
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I can't go to the bath with my father.

398
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
But sometimes I go to the bathroom.

399
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:38,000
It's written on my father's underwear.

400
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
It's cool.

401
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
It's manly.

402
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
It's okay.

403
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
That's all.

404
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Let's go home.

405
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I'll put this away for the time being.

406
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
It's a marionette.

407
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
What is a marionette?

408
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
You did it the day before yesterday.

409
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
You did it the day before yesterday.

410
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
What is this?

411
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
I want to see it.

412
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Try it.

413
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
There are two fists here.

414
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Are you kidding me?

415
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
There are two fists here.

416
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Don't move here.

417
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Are you angry at this time?

418
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I'm angry at this time.

419
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Don't move.

420
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Tell me how to move.

421
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Like this.

422
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Can I bend this?

423
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
How is it?

424
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Like this.

425
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Wait a minute.

426
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
It's true.

427
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,000
There are two fists.

428
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Don't laugh.

429
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Yes.

430
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
It's true.

431
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
It's true.

432
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I heard that the pig won.

433
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Takahana?

434
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
What are you doing?

435
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
It's spring.

436
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,000
You are a strange person.

437
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Why is everyone making such a fuss?

438
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
It was amazing.

439
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
What is it?

440
00:20:51,000 --> 00:21:12,000
There was an old man.

441
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
It was amazing.

442
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
It would be nice if my father was so great.

443
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:23,000
It would be nice if my father was so great.

444
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Really?

445
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I don't know Kazushige at all.

446
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,000
I don't know Kazushige at all.

447
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
I don't know Kazushige at all.

448
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Who is Kazushige?

449
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:43,000
You are a professional.

450
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
What is it?

451
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
You are Kazushige Nagashima.

452
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Yes, I am Kazushige Nagashima.

453
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Everyone likes Nisei.

454
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Who likes Nisei?

455
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Babel Nisei.

456
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:08,000
If you want to go to the sky, the president will come.

457
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
If you want to go to the sky, the president will come.

458
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:16,000
If you want to go to the sky, the president will come.

459
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,000
I think this is amazing.

460
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:45,000
I think this is amazing.
