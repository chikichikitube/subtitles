00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Thank you.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
You're the host, but you're so excited.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Who said that?

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
It's easy to say.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
The captain of this team is...

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Hage.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
The captain of this team is...

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Sashiba.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
It's Sashiba, but...

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
It's Sashiba.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
It's our show, so we're the captains.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
What are you looking at?

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
What are you looking at?

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
This show is brought to you by these sponsors.

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Let's get started.

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Tanaka Kankan's first question is...

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Tanaka's episode quiz!

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
That's a common way to get excited.

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I don't know what to say.

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Let's get started.

22
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Recently,

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Tanaka and I

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
are addicted to

25
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
MyBOOM.

26
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
MyBOOM is a popular show.

27
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Hage's team.

28
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Let's start with Hage.

29
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
What?

30
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
You're an idiot.

31
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
You're an idiot.

32
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I don't like it.

33
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Let's start with an idiot.

34
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
MyBOOM.

35
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I want a car.

36
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I see.

37
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I want a used car.

38
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I want a used car.

39
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
You're an idiot.

40
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Next.

41
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Uwamaki.

42
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
What?

43
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Uwamaki.

44
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
He looks like Uwamaki.

45
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Uwamaki.

46
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
What is Uwamaki?

47
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Table tennis.

48
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Tanuki.

49
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
You just remembered how to use it.

50
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Don't say that I like you.

51
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Don't say that I like you.

52
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Tanuki.

53
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I want a plastic model.

54
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Wrong.

55
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I got it.

56
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I want to get rid of my hair.

57
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
That's it.

58
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
That's it.

59
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Are you guys fighting?

60
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
We're not fighting.

61
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Are you worried about your hair?

62
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I want a fat character.

63
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Fat character?

64
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Fat character.

65
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Fat character.

66
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I want to go to a hotel.

67
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
That's wrong.

68
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
That's wrong.

69
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Baseball.

70
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Baseball.

71
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
MyBOOM.

72
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I want a pig.

73
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Wrong.

74
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000

Tanaka Episode Quiz Question 2.

80
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Tanaka Episode Quiz Question 2.

81
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Lately,

82
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I think puns are very interesting.

83
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
When I gathered my juniors

84
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
and talked about it,

85
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I used a lighter

86
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
as a pun.

87
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
A lighter.

88
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I made everyone laugh.

89
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
What did you do with this lighter?

90
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
What are you talking about?

91
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I don't know.

92
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
With a lighter?

93
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
With a lighter.

94
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
A lighter.

95
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
That's good.

96
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
That's good.

97
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
That's good.

98
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
It's not funny.

99
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
It's not funny at all.

100
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
It's not funny at all.

101
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
A lighter.

102
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
My teeth hurt.

103
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
It's like that now.

104
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
It's like that now.

105
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
My teeth hurt.

106
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I can't say it.

107
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I can't say it.

108
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I can't say it.

109
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I can't say it.

110
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I can't say it.

111
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
A lighter.

112
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
This lighter...

113
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
It's flat.

114
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Thank you.

115
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
That's the end.

116
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
This is a very good opportunity.

117
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I used a lighter

118
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
at that time.

119
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Is that okay?

120
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Lupo-Lighter is a flint.

121
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Lupo-Lighter is a flint.

122
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Lupo-Lighter,

123
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
flint,

124
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
flint,

125
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
flint.

126
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
It's like a lighter.

127
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
There are three in it.

128
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
What's in the box?

129
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Put your hand in it.

130
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Guess what's in it.

131
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Everyone, come forward.

132
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Did you see it in this box?

133
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
It's a memorable book.

134
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
It's a memorable book.

135
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
You said it.

136
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
You said it.

137
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
It's a book.

138
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
The contents of the box are books.

139
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
However,

140
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
the title.

141
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
What kind of book is in it?

142
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
It's a reaction video.

143
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I'll watch it.

144
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
It's a reaction video.

145
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
At least you don't have to move.

146
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
It's hard to do.

147
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
It's hard to do.

148
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
It's hard to do.

149
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
It's hard to do.

150
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
It's a book.

151
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
It's an open book.

152
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
When will it be released?

153
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I don't accept any questions.

154
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I don't accept any questions.

155
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I'll go first.

156
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I'll go first.

157
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I'll go alternately.

158
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I'll go alternately.

159
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
It's a book.

160
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
It's a book.

161
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
It's a book.

162
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
It's a book.

163
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Next

164
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I'll try the first one.

165
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
What kind of animal is it?

166
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
That is the answer.

167
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
It's a papers.

168
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
It's a papers.

169
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
It's called Cinderella.

170
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I can't move.

171
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I can't move.

172
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I can't move.

173
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I told you I was watching your reaction.

174
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I did my best.

175
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
What? You didn't listen?

176
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I did my best.

177
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
You didn't listen?

178
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Why aren't you interested in me?

179
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Why?

180
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Go ahead.

181
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Ah!

182
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
No!

183
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
What is it?

184
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Ah! Ouch! Ouch!

185
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
What?

186
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Isn't it easy?

187
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
It's a book.

188
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Hey, do it.

189
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
What?

190
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Do it.

191
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
It's a book.

192
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Again?

193
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Again?

194
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Why aren't you interested in me?

195
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I didn't listen.

196
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I didn't listen.

197
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
You were watching.

198
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Ah!

199
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
It's hard.

200
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Ah!

201
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
What is it?

202
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
It's hot.

203
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Ah!

204
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
It's hot.

205
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
What is it?

206
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
It's like a picture book.

207
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Ah!

208
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I see.

209
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Is it that one?

210
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
What are you doing?

211
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:16,000
It's a book.

212
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
It's hard.

213
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
It's like a picture book.

214
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
What?

215
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
It's like a picture book.

216
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
No.

217
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
It's like a picture book.

218
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
It's like a picture book.

219
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
You can go home.

220
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Why?

221
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
It's okay, you can go home.

222
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I'm sorry.

223
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Is it the only book you have?

224
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Go home.

225
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I'm sorry.

226
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Do it.

227
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Do it.

228
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I have a lot of books.

229
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Do you have them?

230
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I have them.

231
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
It's the book No.3.

232
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
It's a book.

233
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
What is it?

234
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
What does it mean?

235
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
It's strange.

236
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Time's up!

237
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
What?

238
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Mr.Tanakaze Shagun!

239
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Yay!

240
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Yay!

241
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Yay!

242
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Yes!

243
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
First, Habu Team.

244
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Yes.

245
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Who is it?

246
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Rock, paper, scissors

247
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Agitator

248
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
You know it, right?

249
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
You will get 30 points if you get this question right

250
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Ready, start!

251
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Nagashima?

252
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Nagashima?

253
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I don't have to hit it, right?

254
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Why is your chin sticking out?

255
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Batter

256
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
You hit it

257
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Home run

258
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
You hit a home run

259
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
You ran

260
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Hit it

261
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Banzai

262
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
You got a point

263
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Home base

264
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
How far are you going?

265
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
How far are you going?

266
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
From the top of your head

267
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Baseball?

268
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
From the top of your head

269
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Baseball?

270
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
1st, 2nd, 3rd?

271
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
10,000 points

272
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Wait, what did you say?

273
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
10,000 points

274
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
10,000 points

275
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
That's not fair

276
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
What are you talking about?

277
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
You were doing it

278
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
You hit a home base

279
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I don't know that

280
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Ago

281
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Inoki

282
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
What?

283
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Are you ready?

284
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Wait, wait

285
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Hanaka Naoki

286
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
That's not fair

287
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
You hit a home run

288
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
That's not fair

289
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
That's not fair

290
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
That's not fair

291
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
It's the same if you say the type

292
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
It's fine

293
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
That's right

294
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
You both did well

295
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
It's impossible

296
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
50 points

297
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Who will do it?

298
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Can I decide?

299
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Me?

300
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Please

301
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
50 points

302
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Nakamura will do it

303
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I'm sorry

304
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
It's the Sashiba team's problem

305
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Got it?

306
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Got it

307
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Okay

308
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Start

309
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Match

310
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
It's burning

311
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Crab

312
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Crab

313
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Fire

314
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Match

315
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Fire

316
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Fire

317
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Car

318
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Car

319
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
What's that?

320
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Match

321
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Match

322
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Fire

323
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Car

324
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Car

325
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Car

326
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
You're leaving the car?

327
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
You're leaving the car?

328
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
What?

329
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
What are you doing?

330
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Fire?

331
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
It's definitely fire

332
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
There's no fire?

333
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
You can talk to each other

334
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
You can talk to each other

335
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
You can talk to each other

336
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I won't lose

337
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
You're leaving the car?

338
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
You're leaving the car?

339
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
You're leaving the car?

340
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
You're leaving the car?

341
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
What?

342
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
A child who is crying

343
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
The one who saved

344
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
The one who saved

345
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Tanaka

346
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Correct

347
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
50 points

348
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
It's weird

349
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
If you listen to it, you'll understand it, right?

350
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:56,000
There's no time limit, so you have to keep doing it until you get the answer.

351
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
That's impossible.

352
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
That's impossible.

353
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
But it can't be helped.

354
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
What are you doing?

355
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Sorry.

356
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
That's all!

357
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:20,000
That was Tanaka Kankan!

358
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Help me!

359
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
The only thing I can say is...

360
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I'm sorry for saying too much.

361
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I'm sorry for saying too much.

362
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Good evening!

363
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Thank you for finding me.

364
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Thank you for finding me.

365
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
You should have stopped here.

366
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
You really look like House Kaguya.

367
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I don't know anyone called House Kaguya.

368
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
That means everyone is laughing, right?

369
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Are you House Kaguya?

370
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Then I'm House Kaguya.

371
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I'll do my best.

372
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Thank you very much.

373
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
That's all.

374
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
What do you think?

375
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I had a wonderful experience the other day.

376
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Wonderful?

377
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Wonderful.

378
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I'm going to surprise you with this story.

379
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Tell me.

380
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Do you want to hear it?

381
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
There's a lot.

382
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Really?

383
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Why do you look like Hayashi Sensei?

384
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I don't know who you are.

385
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Tell me.

386
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Tanaka and Endo were in the car.

387
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
They've already experienced it.

388
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I don't like to colorize the story.

389
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I'll tell you what happened.

390
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
It's not a lie.

391
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
It's not a lie.

392
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Last week, I was driving a car.

393
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
There was a guardrail.

394
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
There was a guardrail and there was a road.

395
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I was driving on that road.

396
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
The police officer was driving a white car.

397
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
The guardrail wasn't on this side.

398
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
It was on the other side of the road.

399
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
The car was on the other side of the road.

400
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
The guardrail was on the other side of the road.

401
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
What do you think?

402
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Was there an obstacle?

403
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
No.

404
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Did you have to avoid it?

405
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
No.

406
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
The guardrail was on the other side of the road.

407
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I can't forgive such things.

408
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
It doesn't matter if it's the police or not.

409
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
The car was on the other side of the road.

410
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I was careful.

411
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
This is my prediction.

412
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I'll tell you what I think will happen from now on.

413
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
This is easier to understand.

414
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
It's like NG Taisho.

415
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
It's easy to understand.

416
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I was trying to be careful.

417
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I opened the window.

418
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
The guardrail came.

419
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I thought it was dangerous.

420
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I told the police officer.

421
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
It's dangerous.

422
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I thought it was dangerous.

423
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I told the police officer.

424
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
It was dangerous.

425
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I see.

426
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
The guardrail was in a mess.

427
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
This is normal.

428
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
The guardrail should have run on the street.

429
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I ran around the street and caused trouble.

430
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I thought it was Matsumoto.

431
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I always see Matsumoto.

432
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I caused trouble.

433
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Please do your best.

434
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Please be careful.

435
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
This is my prediction.

436
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I see.

437
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Let's talk about the real story.

438
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I was in trouble.

439
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I opened the window.

440
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I thought I should tell you something.

441
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
What are you doing?

442
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
What?

443
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I'm being beaten up.

444
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I see.

445
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
How can you forgive me?

446
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I'm being beaten up.

447
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I'm telling you something from the other side.

448
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
What are you doing?

449
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Why?

450
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Come on.

451
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
You can't run.

452
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
You can't run.

453
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
You can't run.

454
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
You can't run.

455
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
You can't run.

456
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
What are you doing?

457
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
You can't run.

458
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
You're angry because of the Corax.

459
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I'm scared.

460
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
This is a scary world.

461
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
That's the theme for today.

462
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Thank you.

463
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
The announcer is going to fall.

464
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I heard you did a simulation.

465
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I can't trust that kind of simulation.

466
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
In the past,

467
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I did a face with an airbag.

468
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I didn't feel bad about anyone.

469
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
I felt like I couldn't trust love.

470
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
It was a trauma for me.

471
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I can't trust anyone.

472
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I understand that.

473
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Do you understand?

474
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I can't trust skydiving.

475
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I'm not scared.

476
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Which one?

477
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I'm not scared.

478
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I can't trust people.

479
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I don't care if they're human.

480
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
I'm not scared.

481
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I don't care if I get a slit.

482
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
What are you looking at?

483
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Your bones?

484
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I'm not a bone.

485
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I'm not a bone.

486
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
No more.

487
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Ever since the airbag.

488
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Ever since then.

489
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I was surprised too.

490
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I was surprised too.

491
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I was surprised.

492
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I was scared of you.

493
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
You looked at my face.

494
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
What did you check?

495
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Did you have a nose?

496
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Do you know what I am?

497
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I am a down-to-earth idiot.

498
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
You know what I mean.

499
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
What you are thinking is strange.

500
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,000
The airbag inflates, and then you put your face in it.

501
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I was shocked.

502
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Before the airbag inflates, you put your face in it.

503
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Like this.

504
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Why didn't you know that?

505
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Why did you do that?

506
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Come closer.

507
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Like this.

508
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Why did you do that?

509
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:24,000
You don't take care of your nose hair at all.

510
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Since you were 30, your nose hair has grown thicker.

511
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Why is that?

512
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:36,000
How old do you think a man's genitalia is?

513
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
About 40.

514
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
About 40?

515
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
45.

516
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:45,000
I think 45 is the most genitalia of a man.

517
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I became 35 recently.

518
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:53,000
From now on, I will polish my nose hair as a man for the next 10 years.

519
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:58,000
When that happens, I will have a lot of nose hair.

520
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
As a man.

521
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
This genitalia...

522
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I like it.

523
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
That's good.

524
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
I like it.

525
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,000
I don't want to feel embarrassed as a man.

526
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
You don't mind having a nose hair at this stage?

527
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
I don't mind having a nose hair at this stage.

528
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
But it's not a complete nose hair?

529
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
It's not a complete nose hair.

530
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
The reason why I have so much nose hair is...

531
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,000
When I turn my head, it looks okay.

532
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Does that mean you can turn your head from here?

533
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
For example, when I turn my head...

534
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
If I don't have anything, I look bad as a man.

535
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
When?

536
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,000
It's not like that. When I turn my head...

537
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
If I don't have a nose hair, I look bad as a man.

538
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
But I don't have anything to turn my head.

539
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I'm not saying that.

540
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
For example, I can ride a bike.

541
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I don't have anything to turn my head.

542
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
I don't have anything to turn my head.

543
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
I don't want to talk about turning my head.

544
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I don't care.

545
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:14,000
When I go to the hospital and they ask me to wait for the medicine, I don't care.

546
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
I'll prepare it for you.

547
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:22,000
But when I'm waiting, I can't turn my head.

548
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
You can't turn your head.

549
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
I can't turn my head.

550
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
I can't turn my head.

551
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
I can't turn my head.

552
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
I can't turn my head.

553
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
I can't turn my head.

554
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
I can't turn my head.

555
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:44,000
When you tell me that you have a paper to write something, I'll write down your address.

556
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Turn my head.

557
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Turn my head.

558
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
What are you doing?

559
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
When I turn my head...

560
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Turn your head.

561
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Listen to me.

562
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Listen to me.

563
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
When I turn my head...

564
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
If you don't listen to me, I can't talk.

565
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
What the hell are you talking about?

566
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Listen, really, listen!

567
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
This is...

568
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
This is weird!

569
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
This idiot...

570
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
What should I say?

571
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
So, in a building like this,

572
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I don't know what's going on.

573
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
There's a fire, an ambulance comes,

574
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
and the fire department goes crazy, right?

575
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
At that time,

576
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
there are times when I go out.

577
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
The ambulance says,

578
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
are you okay?

579
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
At that time...

580
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Why are you talking about that?

581
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
So,

582
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
the story of Mekure,

583
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
no matter when,

584
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Mekure is weird.

585
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
If you say that,

586
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
I can't talk.

587
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
I don't need to talk.

588
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
When I went to the inter high school,

589
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
I said,

590
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
hey,

591
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
you put your legs in like this, right?

592
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
At the beginning...

593
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
At the beginning,

594
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
when I put my legs in like this...

595
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:33,000
