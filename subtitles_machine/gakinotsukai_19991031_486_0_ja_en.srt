1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Yōkan no Kanna

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Yōkan, Tsutai wa Nakayoshi-san

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Itsumo Futari de Mitsuyo-kan

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Yōkan no Kanna

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Yōkan no Yome

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
The night is coming

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
It's already time

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
It's already time

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
It's already time

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Everyone is here

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Everyone is here

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
It's not that I'm bad or anything.

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
If I had to say, I'm a politician.

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
What does that have to do with anything?

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
The Takeshita cabinet.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
That's old!

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Well, there are a lot of things.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
What else is there?

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Let's go on.

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
But what about the punishment game?

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Oh, the punishment game! That's right!

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
If you don't tell me that, how will I do it?

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
It's already decided in my head.

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Can I say it?

25
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
For now, just say it.

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
This is going to be a really interesting punishment game.

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,000
There was this guy, the magician.

28
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Copperfield.

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Go see Copperfield.

30
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
America or something.

31
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Why?

32
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
With four people.

33
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Why?

34
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
They made you teleport.

35
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
If you go boom, you won't be able to get rid of the four of them.

36
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
And when the other four came out, for some reason, he became a skinhead.

37
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
This is...

38
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
This is...

39
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Do-wan! Do-wan! Do-wan!

40
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Endo! Do-wan! Yane! Tanaka! Do-wan! Yamazaki! Do-wan!

41
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
You're not even talking.

42
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
After Endo, why did you say Yane?

43
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
You should have said Tanaka right away.

44
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I think this will be a great thing.

45
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,200
Think a little more.

46
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,200
Think a little more?

47
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,200
Yeah, a little more.

48
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,200
But, you know, you thought you were doing it, right?

49
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,200
I don't think you had any problem with me.

50
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,200
Neither Tanaka, nor Endo.

51
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,200
After all, that shit...

52
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,200
That shit is terrible, right?

53
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,200
Who would be in it if that happened?

54
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,200
I was totally late.

55
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,200
I was nervous.

56
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:37,200
If Yamazaki suddenly did it, it would be the worst.

57
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,200
I was the first one to think about it.

58
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,980
And then, I heard the sound of the sun and I thought,

59
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:44,980
It's too late!

60
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:46,980
You know,

61
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:49,980
I don't think you can see it on TV,

62
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:52,980
But if you look at the camera from the side, you can see it.

63
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:56,980
At Tanaka's place, the difference is about 3 meters.

64
00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:02,980
If it wasn't for that, I would have lost more.

65
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:05,980
What is that guy?

66
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:06,980
I see.

67
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:08,980
I really didn't want him to be born.

68
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:11,980
That's not what you're saying.

69
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:13,980
It's because of the show.

70
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:16,980
That's true.

71
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:19,980
When he came to me from the end, he was like this.

72
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:21,980
It was a loss.

73
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:23,980
But before that, he was that slow?

74
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:24,980
He was really slow.

75
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:26,980
He's a neck.

76
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:27,980
He's a neck.

77
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:30,980
He has a little bit of a ego, so it's fine.

78
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:31,980
Really, it's fine?

79
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:36,980
You might think I don't say this on TV, but I think Fujii is cuter.

80
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:48,980
I feel like I'm in the same boat as Fujii.

81
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:55,980
I see.

82
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:56,980
I think Fujii is cuter.

83
00:03:56,980 --> 00:04:01,980
That's why I said, if it's a neck, then let's just say it clearly.

84
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:04,980
Understood.

85
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:05,980
Neck!

86
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:10,980
That's for the person himself.

87
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:11,980
That's right.

88
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:14,980
Even if you say it in a fake way, it's not a problem.

89
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:19,980
It's not a problem, if you say it's a neck.

90
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:21,980
It's a fake!

91
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:25,300
I was angry at first, but after you said you were going to quit, you said,

92
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,180
Say it!

93
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:28,180
This face!

94
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:30,780
This face!

95
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:31,980
What's good about it?

96
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:32,480
What's good about it?

97
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,780
You're taking a life!

98
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:34,880
That's right!

99
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,080
Say it!

100
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,880
Hey!

101
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:40,380
You're talking like that?

102
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:43,380
What are you talking about?

103
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:45,580
But you're a kid, you have nothing to do with it!

104
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:46,780
I have nothing to do with it!

105
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:47,780
You do!

106
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:48,380
What do you mean you don't?

107
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:49,680
Say it!

108
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,980
Yes, I have.

109
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:51,480
Oh!

110
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,480
Simula X.

111
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:52,980
Oh!

112
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:53,480
Oh!

113
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,680
Tensai TV.

114
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,180
Oh!

115
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:57,680
Osaka Nagoya.

116
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,680
Osaka Nagoya.

117
00:04:59,180 --> 00:04:59,880
I have.

118
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:00,980
You have.

119
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:03,180
And you said that you don't want to do it!

120
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:04,680
Hey!

121
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:06,180
Don't say it!

122
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,680
I said it.

123
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:10,680
I said it.

124
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,680
It's over.

125
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,180
It's over?

126
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:14,180
It's over.

127
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:14,980
It's over?

128
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:16,180
You should be the one to say it.

129
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:16,680
Oh.

130
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,680
Oh, it's over?

131
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,680
It's like going back to the bath.

132
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,680
Well, it's fine.

133
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,680
Well, let's think about it again.

134
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,680
Oh, really?

135
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,680
What's going to happen to you?

136
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,680
The story changes completely.

137
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,680
The car...

138
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,680
It's starting next month.

139
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,680
What?

140
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,680
I can't use my cell phone.

141
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,680
Oh, you said something.

142
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,680
You were driving.

143
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:49,680
There are so many idiots who talk on their phones and cause accidents.

144
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,680
They are even allowed to drive this car.

145
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,680
I can do it all by myself.

146
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,680
You can do it.

147
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,680
Right?

148
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,680
That's why it's so...

149
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,680
That's why it's gone.

150
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,680
That earphone.

151
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,680
Ah, yes, yes.

152
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,680
I can't drive like this.

153
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,680
I can't drive like this.

154
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,680
But I think it's strange.

155
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,680
What do you mean?

156
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,680
What's the standard for the police?

157
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,180
What?

158
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:15,180
If you do this, do you know what will happen?

159
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:17,180
Even if you don't have a cell phone.

160
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:20,180
That's what I'm saying.

161
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:23,180
But, what will you do if you smoke like this?

162
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,180
You can't do the same thing.

163
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:28,180
But that's because it's impossible.

164
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:30,180
For example, what is it?

165
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:35,180
If you drive with your shoes like this, is this a violation?

166
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:36,680
I drive with one hand.

167
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,180
No way!

168
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:40,180
You can't do this with your shoes?

169
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:41,180
I drive with one hand.

170
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:42,680
You can't do this with a cigarette?

171
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,180
No, no.

172
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:43,680
Why?

173
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,680
You haven't been told that before?

174
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,680
Then, you should have put your phone in your shoe.

175
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,680
So, you shouldn't be stiff.

176
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:57,680
You shouldn't be stiff, but you put your phone in here.

177
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,180
If you're asked what you're doing, you should say,

178
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:00,180
in your shoe.

179
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,680
I'm going to talk with my shoe.

180
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,680
That's what you should have said.

181
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,680
What's wrong with you? You're taking me to a different place.

182
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,680
The place you're going to is not a hospital.

183
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,680
It's a hospital.

184
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,680
But I'm always like this.

185
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,680
That's right. There's no one who drives normally like this.

186
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,680
There's no one.

187
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,680
When you get to a certain point, it's like this.

188
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,680
What's this?

189
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,680
Well, in my case, I'm left-handed.

190
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,680
That's not good.

191
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,680
You're a fool!

192
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,680
Well, I'm right-handed, but...

193
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:48,680
Are you going to brag about your left-handedness?

194
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,680
Toll On

195
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,260
About the nuanced

196
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,500
Don't you think this is a fray?

197
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:11,500
What's the big deal?

198
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:19,500
Before your debut as a downtown, you had a baby with a thousand children as a step-mother.

199
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,500
Yes, yes.

200
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:26,500
You were born in the Rammer's method, but you were born too many times and were sealed away.

201
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:30,500
I heard that there is a method called the human method.

202
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,500
Yes, yes.

203
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:32,500
What is it?

204
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,500
Actually, it's the human method.

205
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,500
Whichever is fine.

206
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,500
It doesn't matter. You have to be clear about that.

207
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,500
It doesn't matter.

208
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,500
What is your wife's birth date?

209
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,500
What is your wife's birth date?

210
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,500
What?

211
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,500
What did she give birth to?

212
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,500
What do you mean?

213
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,500
What did she do?

214
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,500
What kind of body did she have?

215
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,500
I want to know that.

216
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,500
I don't know what kind of body she had.

217
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,500
What kind of body she had?

218
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,500
What room is it?

219
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,500
Where is your room?

220
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,500
Sofa?

221
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,500
You don't have to make me do that!

222
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,500
What about the country?

223
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,500
I think I know

224
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,500
There is a place called Hitoho

225
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,500
Please teach me that

226
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,500
It's also called Nishinho

227
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,500
Is that okay?

228
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,500
If you are going to do this, please watch carefully

229
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,500
Please leave your hand here.

230
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,500
It's not breathing.

231
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,500
It's not breathing.

232
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,500
There is something like hi-fu.

233
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,500
It's not hi-fu.

234
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,500
Lamaze's method is...

235
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,500
That's what I'm teaching you.

236
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,500
Please do your best until you get your head out.

237
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,500
Do you mean that I should do my best?

238
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,500
You should do your best to live until you get your head out.

239
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,500
And when your head comes out,

240
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,500
Don!

241
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,500
Don!

242
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,500
Don!

243
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,500
Don!

244
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,500
But you can't make a mistake.

245
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,500
If you do this first,

246
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,500
the child will be like this.

247
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,500
The back will be like this.

248
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:23,500
I can't do it fast.

249
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:28,500
It's better to do it fast.

250
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:32,500
I take the train everyday to go to work.

251
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:37,500
Wait a minute. Are you editing something?

252
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:40,500
It's like the first time.

253
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,500
What are you talking about?

254
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Why are you sweating all of a sudden?

255
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I don't know.

256
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
What are you talking about?

257
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,500
What is it?

258
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I take the train everyday to the company.

259
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,500
What was that?

260
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
What are you talking about?

261
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,000
What are you talking about?

262
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I'll go back and press it again.

263
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,000
You're going to the company by the train, but you don't like the crowd.

264
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
That's right. There's a thing called people-intention.

265
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Mr. Matsumoto of the train research group.

266
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Yes.

267
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Please tell us how to spend the train comfortably and freshly.

268
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Of course there's that.

269
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Please tell us how to spend it comfortably.

270
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
It's like this every morning.

271
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
It's like this.

272
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
It's like this.

273
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
You have to use this.

274
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Because you have the rhythm.

275
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Yes.

276
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Right?

277
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
You have to dance.

278
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
It's a train.

279
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Train.

280
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Yes.

281
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
You have to dance.

282
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
You dance so cool.

283
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
No.

284
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
You can't do that.

285
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
No.

286
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
It's just a piece of cloth.

287
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Even so, I'm saying it's OK.

288
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
It's OK.

289
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Try it.

290
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
It's OK.

291
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Please, continue.

292
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
It's embarrassing.

293
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
OK, please show it.

294
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Ah, it was embarrassing.

295
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
It was a good idea.

296
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
It's like an eraser.

297
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Before her debut as downtown, she was the first woman to have a baby.

298
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Her birth was born in the Ramaz method.

299
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
But she was born too many times and was sealed away.

300
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I heard there is a method called the Hitoshi method.

301
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
What kind of method is it?

302
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Actually, this is called the Hito-shi method.

303
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I don't know that.

304
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
It's called the Hito-shi method.

305
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
You can say either.

306
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
You can say either.

307
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
What should I do?

308
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Please teach me.

309
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Hito-shi method.

310
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Please do your best until you get a head.

311
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
What do you mean by do my best?

312
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I mean, I'll do it with all my strength.

313
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
And then, don!

314
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Don!

315
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:40,000
If you don't pay attention, if this leg goes don, your back will go round and round.

316
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
You're a little...

317
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Please say it differently.

318
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Terrible!

319
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I'll kill you as a partner of the comedian Tsubushi!

320
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,720
How many are they dori?
