1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Good evening.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Good evening.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Good evening.

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Good evening.

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
What are you thinking about?

6
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Debayashi seems to be in a rush to do something.

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I told you from the start!

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I told you to change it over and over again!

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I've been thinking about it for the past three weeks.

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
That's too late.

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
It's hard to come up with something.

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Let's really stop.

13
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Let's really stop.

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Let's do an impersonation of Keisuke Kuwata.

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Wait a minute.

16
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
What?

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Actually, everyone does an impersonation of Keisuke Kuwata, right?

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I've seen a lot of Keisuke Kuwata, but I think I'm the most complete.

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Keisuke Kuwata?

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
When it comes to me, I can impersonate Keisuke Kuwata in 10 different ways.

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
You don't have to do 10 different things.

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Show me the best one.

23
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I can't show you the best one.

24
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
There are about 4 Keisuke Kuwata impersonations in the world.

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
You don't have to show me that.

26
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Show me 10.

27
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
What is it?

28
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Tsunami.

29
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
What was Tsunami like?

30
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I don't know.

31
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
You can do an impersonation.

32
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
What was Tsunami like?

33
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
10 different things.

34
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Don't be shy.

35
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You can't just step on poop.

36
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
You can only step on poop today.

37
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Stop it.

38
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
What was Tsunami like?

39
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
There's something like this.

40
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I'm lost in the wind.

41
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
The next one is easier to impersonate.

42
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Have you ever done that song?

43
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I have.

44
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Do it.

45
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I just remembered.

46
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
What's the next one?

47
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Why are there so many?

48
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Did that song sell so well?

49
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I don't know.

50
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Stop it.

51
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
What was it?

52
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I don't know.

53
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
What was it?

54
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I'm lost in the wind.

55
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Your T-shirt is dirty.

56
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
This program is brought to you by these sponsors.

57
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I'm lost in the wind.

58
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
That's right.

59
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I'm weak.

60
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I'm weak.

61
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
That's right.

62
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I'm lost in the wind.

63
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I don't know.

64
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I heard that.

65
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I'm frustrated.

66
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I don't know that much.

67
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
You don't know everything?

68
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I don't know everything.

69
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Later.

70
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Why don't you know anything?

71
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
What?

72
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I was curious.

73
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I'm lost in the wind.

74
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I'm weak.

75
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I'm lost in the wind.

76
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
That's the next problem.

77
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I don't know that.

78
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I'm frustrated.

79
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
What is it?

80
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I'm lost in the wind.

81
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I'm weak.

82
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I'm lost in the wind.

83
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I'm weak.

84
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I'm lost in the wind.

85
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I'm lost in the wind.

86
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I'm lost in the wind.

87
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
That's it.

88
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
But you don't laugh.

89
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I thought it would be like this.

90
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Was I that big?

91
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
You were big.

92
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
You were big.

93
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Later.

94
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Later.

95
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Wait.

96
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
It's finally coming out.

97
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Can you do it with this?

98
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Let's do it with 3.

99
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Please.

100
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
With 3.

101
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Actually it's more than what it looks like.

102
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
That's it.

103
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
No, no, no.

104
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Even if you do it 10 steps.

105
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
No matter how many steps you do.

106
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
It's not that big.

107
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
3 is like this.

108
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
It's 3.

109
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
It's 3 out of 10.

110
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
You're always throwing it the wrong way.

111
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
But now everyone should have seen the belly button.

112
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Don't do 10. Do 6.

113
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
6 is a lot.

114
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Do you want me to raise it?

115
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
No.

116
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Come closer.

117
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
It hurts.

118
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
No, no, no.

119
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
6 means there are only 7, 8 and 9 left.

120
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Until 10.

121
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
There are only 3 left.

122
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
There are only 3 left.

123
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
You're trying really hard.

124
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
It's still like this.

125
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I'm trying really hard.

126
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Then do 7.

127
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
You haven't changed.

128
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I haven't.

129
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
7.

130
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
That was 7.

131
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
8.

132
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:43,000
8, 8.

133
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Now it's finally 9 out of 10.

134
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Right?

135
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
9.

136
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
You have a lot of power.

137
00:05:52,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I have a lot of power.

138
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I was looking at it from a distance.

139
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Then it's 9.

140
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Now everyone is like,

141
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Oh, it's true.

142
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
It's true.

143
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
It's not true.

144
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
It's true.

145
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
It's not true.

146
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
It's not true.

147
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
That's what you think, right?

148
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Yes, I understand.

149
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
You're going to do 10.

150
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Yes.

151
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I'm sorry, but it's finally time to judge.

152
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Yes, 10.

153
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Listen with all your heart.

154
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I'll listen with all my heart.

155
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Listen as if you've become Keisuke Kuwata.

156
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Who?

157
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
The listener too.

158
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
The listener?

159
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:48,000
And all 10 of you will sing together.

160
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
If everyone sings, I can't hear it.

161
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Is it similar or not?

162
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Let me check.

163
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,000
It's hard for me to get that kind of reaction with 9.

164
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
That's because everyone thinks it's similar.

165
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
If you listen to 10 and think,

166
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Everyone stand up and clap.

167
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
You ran away just now, didn't you?

168
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
You didn't run away, did you?

169
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I don't know.

170
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Why are you acting like a gorilla?

171
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Say that.

172
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I don't mean to be like a gorilla.

173
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I can't say that.

174
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I'm sorry.

175
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I thought you were like a gorilla.

176
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I'm sorry.

177
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I'm sorry.

178
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Don't mind me.

179
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I'm sorry.

180
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Don't mind me.

181
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I'm sorry.

182
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I just heard it a little.

183
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I'm sorry.

184
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I'm sorry.

185
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I just heard it a little.

186
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I'm sorry.

187
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I just heard it a little.

188
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I'm sorry.

189
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I'm sorry.

190
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I'm sorry.

191
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I'm sorry.

192
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I'm sorry.

193
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I'm sorry.

194
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I'm sorry.

195
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
You look like a gorilla.

196
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Why don't you talk?

197
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I'm not motivated.

198
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I'm not motivated.

199
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I couldn't get motivated at all.

200
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I just heard it like that.

201
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I made a mistake too.

202
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

203
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Don't say that.

204
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

205
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:56,000
If you say that, I really don't know why I'm wearing a y-shirt.

206
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I'm wearing a y-shirt because I don't want to look like a gorilla.

207
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
That's right.

208
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Because if I don't wear a y-shirt, I'll look like a gorilla.

209
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I don't want to be just a gorilla.

210
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I'm not saying I'm a gorilla, I'm saying I'm a gorilla.

211
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I don't know how long ago I heard you saying you're a gorilla.

212
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I couldn't make a mistake.

213
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I'm a gorilla.

214
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Did you hear that?

215
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
You're not saying you're a gorilla, are you?

216
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I'm not a gorilla.

217
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I'm not a gorilla.

218
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
No, I'm a gorilla.

219
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Stop it!

220
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
You're a gorilla!

221
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:54,000
If that's what you're saying, then I'm a gorilla.

222
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I'm a gorilla.

223
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I'm a gorilla.

224
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
That's good.

225
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
It's good, right?

226
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I'm sorry, but you can do whatever you want.

227
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
It's just my nasal voice.

228
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I see.

229
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
It's not as loud as usual.

230
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
What?

231
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Nothing.

232
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I'm sorry, but you can do whatever you want.

233
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I'm sorry, but you can do whatever you want.

234
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I'm not a gorilla.

235
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I'm not a gorilla.

236
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
My voice is coming out.

237
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I'm sorry.

238
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
It's not like that.

239
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
My voice isn't coming out?

240
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
You said you're not a gorilla.

241
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I just admitted that I'm a gorilla.

242
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Then what am I?

243
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

244
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I'm a gorilla.

245
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:04,000
It's coming out!

246
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I'm sorry, but you can do whatever you want.

247
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I'm sorry, but you can do whatever you want.

248
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I'm sorry, but you can do whatever you want.

249
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Is Keisuke Kuwata the gorilla version?

250
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:36,000
If Keisuke Kuwata is the gorilla version...

251
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I think that's enough.

252
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
You've done a lot, haven't you?

253
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I've done a lot?

254
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
What is this?

255
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
What is this conversation?

256
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
It's my stress release.

257
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I've done a lot, haven't I?

258
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
If I can do it, I'll do it at home.

259
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
If I can do it, I'll do it at work.

260
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
It's like everyone's gathered because of my selfishness.

261
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
It's like everyone's gathered because of my selfishness.

262
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I've done a lot, haven't I?

263
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Why? You came out and didn't say anything, but you said you'd do it.

264
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I said it.

265
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I want to make everyone proud.

266
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
It's cold this year, even though I've been told many times.

267
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
It's cold this year, even though I've been told many times.

268
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Even though I've been told many times.

269
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
What is a gorilla?

270
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
It's not even a gorilla.

271
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Who's aiming for a gorilla?

272
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
What are you talking about?

273
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:47,000
It's the same as trying to be a human being.

274
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Who's trying to be on the gorilla side?

275
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
It's the opposite.

276
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I don't understand what you're saying.

277
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
That's enough.

278
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I have something I have to decide today.

279
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
That's right.

280
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Hey, come here.

281
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Thank you.

282
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:15,000
As I said before, we're going to have a rematch.

283
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Wait a minute. Why is everyone...

284
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
That's the key.

285
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
It's the Hamada side.

286
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Why are you getting more and more confused?

287
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:30,000
In the previous penalty game, the four of us are really stuck.

288
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
What?

289
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Yes?

290
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I spoke properly.

291
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
We're stuck in the previous penalty game.

292
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Oh, you're stuck.

293
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I'm stressed out.

294
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
What are you doing?

295
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
What are you doing?

296
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
As I said the other day, it's a swimming competition.

297
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
The staff is simulating it.

298
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I'm thinking about this version.

299
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Let's watch the video.

300
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Are you sure?

301
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Yes.

302
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
He's still a swimmer.

303
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Wow.

304
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
He's good at swimming.

305
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
That's cool.

306
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
That's cool.

307
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:41,000
That's cool.

308
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
He's like a kamasaka.

309
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
The first swimmer is Hirao, 50 meters.

310
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000
The Hamada team swam 12.5 meters.

311
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
The first swimmer is Hirao, 50 meters.

312
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Matsumoto swam 50 meters.

313
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:00,000
The Hamada team swam 12.5 meters.

314
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I just did this.

315
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
This is a touch.

316
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
If you swim 12.5 meters, you'll be the next swimmer.

317
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
12.5 meters?

318
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Yes.

319
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
There are four of you.

320
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I can't speed up.

321
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
That's right.

322
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
If you stop once...

323
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
It's completely different.

324
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:26,000
This is a touch, right?

325
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
This is bad.

326
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
This is impossible.

327
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
But you're still swimming.

328
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Yes.

329
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:40,000
You're getting slower.

330
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Who is this?

331
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I don't know.

332
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I lost.

333
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Matsumoto won.

334
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
The next swimmer is Kurool, 50 meters.

335
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,000
The Hamada team swam 12.5 meters.

336
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
This is a touch.

337
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Get ready.

338
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I'm not good at swimming.

339
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I can't swim.

340
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:27,000
This is impossible.

341
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:39,000
You're getting faster.

342
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,000
The Hamada team won the race.

343
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
The last swimmer is Kurool, 50 meters.

344
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
The Hamada team won the race.

345
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,000
This time, they will use the swimming cap as a baton.

346
00:16:52,000 --> 00:17:04,000
This is a baton.

347
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,000
This is impossible.

348
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:19,000
This is impossible.

349
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:33,000
This is impossible.

350
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:41,000
The swimming cap lost a lot of time, and Matsumoto won the race.

351
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Why did I get this?

352
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
This is a strange story.

353
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I see.

354
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I noticed something that no one noticed.

355
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
What is it?

356
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:59,000
First of all, if it's not a 50-meter pool, it's no good.

357
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,000
If it's a pool, it's no good.

358
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
The opponent will turn, so it's a big loss.

359
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,000
So the three of them will swim in the middle of the pool.

360
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
And the one who can kick will win.

361
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:19,000
And the hat is too heavy.

362
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
But the baton is good.

363
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
What?

364
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
No, no, no.

365
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I don't think so.

366
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
The baton is good.

367
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
The baton is impossible.

368
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Let me say it again.

369
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
The baton is good.

370
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
The baton is good.

371
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
The baton is impossible.

372
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
But Matsumoto won the race, didn't he?

373
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Yes, yes, yes.

374
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
But Matsumoto won the race, didn't he?

375
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
No, no, no.

376
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Why?

377
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I don't have any proof.

378
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I touched the baton, and he said,

379
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I touched the baton, and he said,

380
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I don't have any proof.

381
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
No, no, no.

382
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:57,000
But Matsumoto won the race, and he said,

383
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I don't have any proof.

384
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I touched the baton, and he said,

385
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I touched the baton, and he said,

386
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I touched the baton, and he said,

387
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I found out where you were going.

388
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
All of you are Japanese.

389
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Japanese?

390
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
All of you are Japanese.

391
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
So how do we play?

392
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I'm going to…

393
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
We're going to compete, right?

394
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
To compete.

395
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
The free or free, right?

396
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
No, no, we're going to compete.

397
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Yes, right.

398
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:07,320
So it's a kind of

399
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,000
We're going to compete.

400
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
So it's a kind of

401
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Dark roll.

402
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
And the free one is dark roll.

403
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Yes, and that's the best,

404
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Nice.

405
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
It's dark roll.

406
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
But what if I say I can't do dark roll?

407
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
But what if I say I can't crawl?

408
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
What?

409
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
You can't crawl?

410
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Not that I can't, but I've never really thought about crawling.

411
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
We haven't thought about it either.

412
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
We haven't thought about it either.

413
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
When I watch TV, I'm focused on the TV.

414
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
We're the same.

415
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
When we're eating, we're focused on the food.

416
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
No, that's not it.

417
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
He's the one who suggested the swimming competition.

418
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
That's right.

419
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Hmm...

420
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Well, even if you say that...

421
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
The one who suggested the swimming competition was Gorilla.

422
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
You didn't say Gorilla.

423
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
That's right.

424
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Well, that's fine.

425
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I only know one thing.

426
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:00,000
What?

427
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I can't jump into the water.

428
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
You can jump from below.

429
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Stand up.

430
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
You can't jump into the water?

431
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
I can't jump into the water.

432
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
But I can't do that either.

433
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
You can't jump into the water?

434
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Then you can jump from below.

435
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
You can jump from below.

436
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
But that's not good.

437
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
That's right.

438
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
The pool is 50 meters.

439
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
50?

440
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
It's not 25 meters.

441
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
If it's not 50 meters, it's hard to understand.

442
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
What about the memo?

443
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
The memo is fine.

444
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Miso.

445
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
You don't have to write it.

446
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
You don't use it, right?

447
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
What do you use?

448
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
I don't use it.

449
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Gorilla.

450
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
I want to write Gorilla.

451
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Please write it.

452
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
I don't use it.

453
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
What do you use?

454
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
I don't forget.

455
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
I don't forget today's return.

456
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I see.

457
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
It's okay.

458
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
It's not related to the competition.

459
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
It's not related to the competition.

460
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
So

461
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
If you look at the part,

462
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I divided it into four parts.

463
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
50 meters.

464
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Why didn't you say that?

465
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
What is this bitter feeling?

466
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Everyone will swim evenly.

467
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
12.5 meters.

468
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
12.5 meters.

469
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Can I decide the order?

470
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
No, you can't.

471
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Why?

472
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Bitter.

473
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I want to do it in the previous order.

474
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
It's a revenge.

475
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
That's right.

476
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
I want to hit Mr. Matsumoto at the start.

477
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Let's do it.

478
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
You lost last time, right?

479
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I lost.

480
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I'll do my best.

481
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Tanaka.

482
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Endo and my baton.

483
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I lost last time.

484
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
I lost.

485
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Let's go with this.

486
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
There is no point in winning with this.

487
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
When is the game?

488
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Next week.

489
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
It's coming.

490
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
It's a punishment game.

491
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
It's a punishment.

492
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
It's a punishment that I will never forget.

493
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
But

494
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
After the game,

495
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
I think about whether there is a punishment or not.

496
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
I think about whether there is a punishment or not.

497
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
There is a punishment.

498
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
There is a punishment.

499
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Why did you get a punishment?

500
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
It's coming.

501
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Stop it.

502
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Why are we running?

503
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
It just happened.

504
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
It's not just a coincidence.

505
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
It's a taboo.

506
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
What are you talking about?

507
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
It was like that at the time.

508
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
No, no.

509
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
I'll do my best.

510
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I'll do my best.

511
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
I'll do my best.

512
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
I'll be like, which one did I win?

513
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
I'll be like, which one did I win?

514
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
I'll be like, which one did I win?

515
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
I'll be like, which one did I win?

516
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Next week.

517
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Without batons?

518
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Without batons.

519
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
I'm begging you.

520
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
I can't do that.

521
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Drink the water.

522
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
If you drink it...

523
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Where?

524
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Okay.

525
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Next week.

526
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Next week.

527
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Revenge.

528
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Revenge.

529
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Next week.

530
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
The first match of the 21st century.

531
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
The first match of the 21st century.

532
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,000
This program was brought to you by these sponsors.
