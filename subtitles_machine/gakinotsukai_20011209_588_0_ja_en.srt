1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I don't want to say this at the end of the year, but really, in the true sense, aren't you going to quit?

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Eh?

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Ah, Yamasaki

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Yamasaki

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
No, I've been doing this for 14 years

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Why do you have to quit?

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Even if I quit in this world, I'm still a kid

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Please be quiet

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I've been sleeping since the second time

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
No, no

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
It's said that this is the worst period after the war

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Ah, it seems like that

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Are you going to continue doing this?

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Are you going to continue doing this?

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm a gyara thief

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Why are you a gyara thief? I'm doing my best

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
What about you guys?

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I've been doing this for 5 years

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Before I was called, I thought I didn't need it since I was watching Gaki

20
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I thought of it when I was a winner

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
If I quit, what are you going to do?

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Who's going to fill my hole?

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
You can't fill it, right?

24
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
The hole called Yamasaki Hosei

25
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
No, there's no hole

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The hole is like this

27
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I have one person

28
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I think this person is different

29
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Who is it?

30
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Muragami Shoji

31
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Shoji-san

32
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Shoji-san is really amazing

33
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,000
When he was cornered, it was like an explosion

34
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
He said something that surprised me

35
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
For example, this tissue

36
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
He asked me to do something with this tissue

37
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
He said something that surprised me

38
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
This is strange

39
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
But if you do that

40
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Can you do it?

41
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I can do it

42
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Really?

43
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I've been doing this for 14 years

44
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I can't believe you did that

45
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
It's amazing

46
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
For example, this

47
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
The tissue is handed over

48
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Like this

49
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Take it off

50
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
It's broken

51
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I can't take it off

52
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Pia-chan

53
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
It's funny

54
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I think it's better if Shoji-san does it

55
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Shoji-san is not like this

56
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Can you do it?

57
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I think I can do it

58
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I don't know

59
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
But I think Shoji-san can do it

60
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Shoji-san is not like this

61
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Eat properly

62
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I think I can do it

63
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I think I can do it

64
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I think Shoji-san can do it

65
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I think Shoji-san can do it

66
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
This program is brought to you by a brand sponsor

67
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I can't do it

68
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I'm sorry

69
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
No

70
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I'm sorry

71
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
But

72
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I told you I can do it

73
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Why?

74
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
But I think I can do it

75
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Really?

76
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Then you

77
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I think you can do it

78
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
This is difficult

79
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
What are you going to do with this?

80
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
If you tell me with this

81
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
If you tell me with this

82
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Can you do it?

83
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I can do it

84
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
What are you doing?

85
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
But if

86
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
If Shoji-san is here

87
00:03:49,000 --> 00:04:18,000
It will be like this

88
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Huh?

89
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Huh?

90
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Huh?

91
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Huh?

92
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Can you do it?

93
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:39,000
This is difficult

94
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Um

95
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
You can do it

96
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
This is difficult

97
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,000
This is difficult

98
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Anything can be done

99
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
That's right

100
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
There are many like this

101
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
There are many like this

102
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
This is good

103
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
This is good

104
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I don't know

105
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
This is

106
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I can't do it

107
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I can't do it

108
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
This is amazing

109
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I wonder if Shoji-san can do it

110
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:16,000
You can do it

111
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
In the past, when I went to the kitchen once

112
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
There were a lot of things

113
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Now this is just this

114
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
There are things like this

115
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
You're good at it

116
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
You're good at it

117
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
For example

118
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Tokkuri Seita

119
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Tokkuri?

120
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Yes

121
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Tokkuri Seita

122
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
You wear it like this

123
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
The moment your face pops out

124
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
You wear it like this

125
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
The moment your face pops out

126
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I'll just say something amazing

127
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
You're good

128
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Really?

129
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:13,000
It's probably like this

130
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Um

131
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Um

132
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Um

133
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Um

134
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Um

135
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Um

136
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Um

137
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Um

138
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Um

139
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Um

140
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:35,000
This is amazing

141
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
What was mouths like?

142
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
No

143
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
For example

144
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
There are slippers

145
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
If you don't say slippers

146
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Well, there are quite a lot

147
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Well, there were many people in the past

148
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:52,800
Take this

149
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,800
That's a lot of tricks!

150
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,800
Endo, that's too easy

151
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,800
It's completely different

152
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,800
It's too easy

153
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,800
But, maybe...

154
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,800
If it was Shouni-san, it would be like this

155
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,800
Shouni-san's room

156
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,800
Coffee and...

157
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,800
One

158
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,800
That's amazing

159
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,800
It's amazing

160
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,800
It's amazing

161
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,800
It's still on, right?

162
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,800
The scissors and sandals are still on

163
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,800
That's amazing

164
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,800
It's amazing

165
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,800
You can do anything with two people

166
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,800
That's right

167
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:56,800
I think you can go to places where it's impossible

168
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,800
For example, something that looks like this

169
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,800
You're wearing it

170
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,800
It can't be

171
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,800
Something that looks like this

172
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,800
It can't be

173
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,800
The scissors and sandals are completely different

174
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,800
It can't be

175
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,800
I think this is a call

176
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,800
It can't be

177
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,800
What?

178
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,800
Hey!

179
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,800
Hey!

180
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,800
Who is it?

181
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,800
Hmm?

182
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,800
Well, well

183
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,800
This is for editing

184
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,800
That's right

185
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,800
You know

186
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,800
It's not just one person

187
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,800
It's like

188
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,800
Even when you're with an amateur, it's explosive

189
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,800
You can do that?

190
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,800
Even when you're with an amateur

191
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,800
I've never seen anything like that

192
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,800
For example, when you go to the hospital and the doctor says you have a cold

193
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,800
The response is amazing

194
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,800
There's no such thing as an interesting response

195
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,800
There's no such thing

196
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,800
Because the doctor says you have a cold

197
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,800
That's the end

198
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,800
If you do it, will you do it?

199
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,800
Hmm, you have a cold

200
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,800
Don't say stupid things

201
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,800
You're a very good student

202
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,800
You have the same eyes as me

203
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,800
When you say a person

204
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,800
It's like a room runner

205
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,800
It's noisy

206
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,800
The person below

207
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,800
The person below

208
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,800
It's noisy!

209
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,800
It's angry

210
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,800
When it's angry

211
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:31,800
The response is amazing

212
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,800
If it's interesting

213
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,800
You can avoid the people below

214
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,800
It's funny

215
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,800
I'm nervous

216
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,800
It's angry

217
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,800
It's funny

218
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,800
But this is

219
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:59,800
I don't know

220
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,800
Shut up

221
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:05,800
I'm not in the goal yet

222
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,800
Wait

223
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,800
It's angry

224
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:19,800
It's the opposite

225
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,800
I see

226
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,800
I'm not in the goal yet

227
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:27,800
And it leaves with the angry residents

228
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:31,800
That's the calculation

229
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,800
That's the calculation

230
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,800
You live here

231
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,800
We went out together

232
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,800
It's normal to go out

233
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,800
We went out earlier

234
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,800
We went out earlier

235
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,800
You know

236
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,800
You know

237
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,800
You know

238
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,800
It's a normal thing

239
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,800
It's a normal thing

240
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,800
It's a normal thing

241
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,800
You go to a sushi restaurant

242
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,800
You go to a sushi restaurant

243
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,800
You ask what you want to eat

244
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,800
You go to a sushi restaurant

245
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,800
You ask what you want to eat

246
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,800
It's hard

247
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,800
You ask what you want to eat

248
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,800
You ask what you want to eat

249
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,800
You ask what you want to eat

250
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,800
You ask what you want to eat

251
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,800
Welcome

252
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,800
It's open

253
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,800
What do you want to eat?

254
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,800
Tetsubo

255
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,800
It's amazing

256
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,800
Right?

257
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,800
It's amazing

258
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,800
We took you to a sushi restaurant

259
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,800
It's amazing

260
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,800
What do you think?

261
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:55,800
I think it's amazing

262
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:59,800
We didn't do that

263
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,800
We didn't do that

264
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,800
We didn't do that

265
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,800
It's strange

266
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,800
It's a catch

267
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,800
It's not realistic

268
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,800
It's not

269
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,800
Next

270
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,800
It's amazing

271
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,800
It's amazing

272
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,800
It's amazing

273
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,800
It's amazing

274
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,800
It's amazing

275
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,800
You can't say anything

276
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,800
You're scared

277
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,800
You're surprised

278
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,800
You can't say anything

279
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,800
You're surprised

280
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,800
You're surprised

281
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,800
You're surprised

282
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,800
I don't know what to do.

283
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,800
You were cold last week, weren't you?

284
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,800
I didn't have a fight.

285
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,800
The final words...

286
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,800
After all the fighting...

287
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,800
But...

288
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,800
I think it's amazing.

289
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,800
What if it's Yamazaki?

290
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,800
Do you want to imagine it?

291
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,800
Wait a minute.

292
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,800
That's right.

293
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,800
Wait a minute.

294
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,800
What if it's Yamazaki?

295
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,800
Yamazaki and a 2 meter tall black man...

296
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,800
Wait a minute.

297
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,800
Is it like this?

298
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,800
Really?

299
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:51,800
Wait a minute.

300
00:14:51,800 --> 00:15:19,800
What are you doing?

301
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:33,800
Wait a minute.

302
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:49,800
I quit.

303
00:15:49,800 --> 00:16:07,800
I quit.

304
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,800
It's been about three weeks since the talk.

305
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,800
Is that so?

306
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,800
I haven't done it for a while.

307
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:17,800
I'm not feeling well.

308
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,800
Are you feeling well?

309
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,800
I'm not feeling bad.

310
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:25,800
I'm not feeling bad because you're feeling bad.

311
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:29,800
I feel like I've accumulated.

312
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,800
What?

313
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,800
What you ate.

314
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,800
And...

315
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:39,800
It smells so bad that I can't laugh.

316
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:43,800
I'm so angry.

317
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:49,800
It smells so bad that I can't laugh.

318
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,800
When I'm angry?

319
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,800
When I'm angry.

320
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,800
It smells bad when I'm angry.

321
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:59,800
It's four times as bad as you think.

322
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,800
It's four times as bad as you think.

323
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,800
It smells bad.

324
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,800
It smells bad.

325
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:09,800
I feel like my nostrils are closing.

326
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:13,800
It smells so bad that I don't want to go to the bathroom.

327
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,800
Why don't you go to the bathroom?

328
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:19,800
I have to go to the bathroom.

329
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,800
Have you ever been to the bathroom?

330
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,800
I have.

331
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,800
I've never been to the bathroom.

332
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:29,800
I've been to the bathroom every morning.

333
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,800
Really?

334
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,800
Yes.

335
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,800
Why?

336
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,800
Why?

337
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,800
Why?

338
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,800
I'm trying to live.

339
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,800
No doubt.

340
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:47,800
I don't want to be late and die.

341
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,800
You want to live.

342
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,800
I want to live.

343
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,800
Really?

344
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,800
One of us will die first.

345
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:59,800
One of us will die first and one of us will go to the funeral.

346
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,800
We can't die at the same time.

347
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,800
That's right.

348
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:09,800
When I was asked by a reporter, I wanted to be on the EU side.

349
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,800
That's right.

350
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,800
I don't want to go home.

351
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,800
I don't want to go home.

352
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,800
Kiyosu said that.

353
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,800
I'm a little embarrassed.

354
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,800
Kiyosu said that.

355
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,800
He was always angry.

356
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,800
He was always angry.

357
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,800
Why are you so angry?

358
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,800
I don't know.

359
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,800
I know everything.

360
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,800
I know everything.

361
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,800
I know everything.

362
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:39,800
I used to work part-time as a judge at a track and field competition.

363
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,800
I have a question for Matsumoto.

364
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,800
Where do you sell the stick?

365
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,800
Please tell me.

366
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,800
It's a simple question.

367
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,800
Where do you sell it?

368
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,800
Please tell me.

369
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,800
To be honest,

370
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,800
I don't sell it at the store.

371
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,800
I don't sell it at the store.

372
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,800
No.

373
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,800
There is a high jump.

374
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,800
It's not a stick high jump.

375
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,800
What do you call it?

376
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,800
It's a running high jump.

377
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,800
You have to enter from there.

378
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,800
For example,

379
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,800
We have a car license.

380
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,800
It's a temporary stage before that.

381
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,800
What?

382
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,800
It's a running high jump.

383
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,800
So

384
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:25,800
A person who has gone to a certain level of running high jump

385
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:29,800
Can't go to the stick anymore?

386
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,800
It's completely different from what you do.

387
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,800
It's the same as jumping.

388
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:37,800
So, it depends on whether you can go to the stick or not.

389
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,800
It depends on whether you can go to the stick or not.

390
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,800
The name is Kanzaki.

391
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,800
Kanzaki is a stick.

392
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,800
I don't know if the stick is good or bad.

393
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,800
What are you talking about?

394
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,800
There is a man.

395
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,800
There is a man in Sumo.

396
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,800
There is a man in Sumo.

397
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,800
The owner of the stick.

398
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:59,800
The owner of the stick is decided by the five of us.

399
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,800
So, Kanzaki says,

400
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,800
Bring out the stick.

401
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,800
I don't know about Kanzaki.

402
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,800
I just say it.

403
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,800
Who is it?

404
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,800
Shinohara.

405
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,800
Shinohara says,

406
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,800
Bring out the stick.

407
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,800
Shinohara says,

408
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,800
Thank you very much.

409
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,800
You can fly or not.

410
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,800
You can fly or not.

411
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,800
I want to do this.

412
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,800
Shinohara flew.

413
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,800
You did it.

414
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,800
Next is the stick.

415
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,800
What did Shinohara do?

416
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,800
You can't say this on TV.

417
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,800
An amateur shouldn't have a stick.

418
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,800
An amateur shouldn't have a stick.

419
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,800
What?

420
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,800
What did Shinohara do?

421
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,800
Shinohara?

422
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,800
Tomorrow morning,

423
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:51,800
There is a person who comes to sell secretly.

424
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,800
Don't miss it.

425
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,800
And,

426
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,800
Shinohara is sleeping.

427
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,800
Did you start from there?

428
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,800
It's about 7 o'clock.

429
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,800
It's 9 o'clock.

430
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,800
It's 9 o'clock.

431
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,800
It's about 9 o'clock.

432
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,800
Throw the stick.

433
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:15,800
I think this is just a stick.

434
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,800
I think this is just a stick.

435
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,800
Think about it.

436
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,800
Where is the person who sells only a stick in this big city?

437
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,800
Where is the person who sells only a stick in this big city?

438
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,800
That is a camouflage of a stick seller.

439
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,800
That is a camouflage of a stick seller.

440
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,800
Really?

441
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,800
Really.

442
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,800
He goes down to the wallet.

443
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,800
He goes down to the wallet.

444
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,800
Excuse me.

445
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,800
Excuse me.

446
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,800
Is it a stick seller?

447
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,800
The person who was pretending to be a stick seller

448
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,800
The person who was pretending to be a stick seller

449
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,800
He asked me.

450
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,800
He asked me.

451
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,800
Then,

452
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,800
He goes down.

453
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,800
He goes down.

454
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:09,800
He goes down.

455
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,800
It's about 9 o'clock.

456
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,800
It's about 9 o'clock.

457
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:39,800
It's about 9 o'clock.

458
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:47,800
Thank you very much.

459
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:53,800
It's about 9 o'clock.

460
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,800
Thank you for watching!
