1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Youkai

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:09,000
They have a deep connection with the human world with many legends from the ancient times of Japan

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
We have been mislead at times and have received grace at other times

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Just a year ago, we met several Youkai in downtown

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Tonight, we went to the school that is rumored to be the best in Japan

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Entering the Youkai, the school Youkai

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
What do you have for us today?

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Well...

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
There is a lot of spiritual energy

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I can't show it to children

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I can feel the spiritual energy around here

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I can tell right away

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Really?

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
There are a lot of Youkai

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Are they already out here?

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Yes, they are

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Really?

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Yes

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
This is the school

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
This is a scary picture

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
This program is brought to you by the following sponsors

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
This is a scary picture

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
There is someone here, Matsumoto-san

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
They are already out here?

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Matsumoto-san, I think I saw them last year

26
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
They are already out here

27
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
They are still here

28
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
They are already out here this year

29
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
What is this Youkai?

30
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
What is this Youkai?

31
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
A cat girl

32
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Youkai is a cat girl

33
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
This girl loves Temari and Yasuri

34
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
She is so energetic that her spirit has almost disappeared

35
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
A Youkai cat girl

36
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Isn't this too violent?

37
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
This is a good Youkai

38
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
She is just playing with Maritsuki

39
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Yes, she is not violent at all

40
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
She is not violent, but she has been lying down for a while

41
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
She is getting jealous

42
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
She doesn't want to go up

43
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
She is always like this

44
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
It would be a big deal if we took her down

45
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Is it dangerous?

46
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Yes

47
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Are you going to do it?

48
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I will

49
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Are you sure?

50
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Yes

51
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Don't do it

52
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I will

53
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
What?

54
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
We haven't had a big meeting yet

55
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
That was close

56
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
That was scary

57
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Let's go to the next one

58
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
A cat girl for the first time in a year

59
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Is it close?

60
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
It's really scary

61
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Can you feel it from the bottom?

62
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Yes

63
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
This is scary

64
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
What is this?

65
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
It's screaming

66
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
It's scary

67
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
It's scary

68
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
It's really scary

69
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
It's scary

70
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
What?

71
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
It's really scary

72
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
It's scary

73
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Something is coming

74
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
It's walking

75
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
What?

76
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
It's scary

77
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
What is this?

78
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
It's a monster

79
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Is it running?

80
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
It's a monster running

81
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I was really scared

82
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
A strange drum is ringing

83
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Many children were lured by the sound

84
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
A monster running

85
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
It was really scary

86
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
It was really scary

87
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
It was really scary

88
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
We should have put our hands out

89
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
What is this?

90
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
It's a monster running

91
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
It's said that it eats children

92
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Is that so?

93
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
It's scary

94
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
That's why this elementary school...

95
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
It's okay because it's not interested in adults

96
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
That's why it passed by

97
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Yes

98
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
What if it enters the school building?

99
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
It will enter the school building

100
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
It's suddenly hot

101
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Is it here?

102
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I can hear something

103
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
What is this?

104
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
It's scary

105
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I can hear something from there

106
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
There should be no one

107
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
This summer vacation

108
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
From the music room of the elementary school

109
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I can hear the piano

110
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
What is this?

111
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
It's scary

112
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
What is this?

113
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
It's a monster running

114
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
It's a monster running

115
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
We should have put our hands out

116
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
It's a monster running

117
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Let the wind blow

118
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
It's a monster running

119
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
It's a monster running

120
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
You bastard

121
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
It's a monster running

122
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
What is this?

123
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
It's a monster running

124
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
A long time ago

125
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,000
A young man was found by a man

126
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
It was a music room

127
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Yo-kai Mo-tei

128
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
The teacher is coming!

129
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Mo-tei!

130
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
The machine is scary.

131
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Scary! Scary! Scary!

132
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
This is dangerous!

133
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
If you get caught in this, it's over!

134
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Mo-tei!

135
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Yamazaki, push it in! Push it in!

136
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Mo-tei! Mo-tei!

137
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Good job!

138
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
That's the only way to get rid of it.

139
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
That's right.

140
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
It was a great desire.

141
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
You're completely in the mouth.

142
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
It's coming again!

143
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Where did you go?

144
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Yo-kai Running has appeared again.

145
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
He's not a bad guy.

146
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Really?

147
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
He's just passing by.

148
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
He doesn't do anything to adults.

149
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Scary!

150
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Is he looking for a child?

151
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
What?

152
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
He's carrying something.

153
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
What?

154
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Yo-kai Bo-in

155
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Yo-kai Bo-in

156
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Yo-kai Bo-in?

157
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Bo-in

158
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Bo-in

159
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Don't say it to yourself.

160
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
With a guitar in his hand, he travels all over the country.

161
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
He's the number one bo-in in the Yo-kai world.

162
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
He's the number one bo-in in the Yo-kai world.

163
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Yo-kai Bo-in

164
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Bo-in

165
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
What are you doing?

166
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
He's the number one bo-in in the Yo-kai world, but he sings his own song.

167
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
It's like saying, I'm still 16.

168
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I see.

169
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Bo-in

170
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
You're still alive.

171
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Are you still going to sing?

172
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Actually, the boss comes out later.

173
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
The boss?

174
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:02,000
The boss is coming out of the health room.

175
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Here?

176
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
He's really coming out.

177
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I'm scared.

178
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Yamazaki, someone's here.

179
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Are you sure?

180
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
He's here.

181
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
He's calling.

182
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
He's calling.

183
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Yamazaki, go.

184
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
What?

185
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Go.

186
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
What are you going to do?

187
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Hold him from the top.

188
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
He's coming out.

189
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
He's coming out.

190
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
He's coming out.

191
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
He's the number one bo-in in the Yo-kai world.

192
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
He's hiding in the health room bed.

193
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:48,000
He's the number one bo-in in the Yo-kai world.

194
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
The number one bo-in in the Yo-kai world.

195
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I'm scared.

196
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I'm really scared.

197
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I can't do this.

198
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Is this the boss character?

199
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
This is the boss character.

200
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Yamazaki, do something.

201
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Yamazaki, do something.

202
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I can't do anything.

203
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I'm begging you.

204
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Get the teacher.

205
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
You said you wanted to see the teacher.

206
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I really like matcha.

207
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Please forgive me.

208
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Please forgive me.

209
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Please forgive me.

210
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Thank you.

211
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Help me.

212
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Help me.

213
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Run away.

214
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I'm scared.

215
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Help me.

216
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I can't do this.

217
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I'm scared.

218
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I want to sleep.

219
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
This year was more intense.

220
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I think it will be the same next year.

221
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
You managed to escape.

222
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I'm desperate.

223
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
The Yo-kai world is full of evil spirits.

224
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
It's a real Yo-kai.

225
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
It's a real Yo-kai.

226
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
It's said that there is no way to deal with it.

227
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
It doesn't work.

228
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Let's get out of here.

229
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Let's get out of here.

230
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Let's go.

231
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I'm really sorry.

232
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I'm really sorry.

233
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
It's been a long time.

234
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
It's been a long time.

235
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I don't talk much.

236
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
It's been a long time since I've been here.

237
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I lost my motivation.

238
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
What do you mean you lost your motivation?

239
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I had a lot of fun.

240
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I had a lot of fun.

241
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I took a break.

242
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I heard that you went to the beach and picked up girls.

243
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I didn't.

244
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I heard a lot of great things.

245
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I went to the beach with a yoga mat.

246
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I waited for you in the car.

247
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I waited for you in the car.

248
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
These videos are useful.

249
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:16,000
You can watch it right away.

250
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
What are you doing?

251
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Don't say anything.

252
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Don't say anything.

253
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I didn't do anything.

254
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
You went with me, didn't you?

255
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I didn't do anything.

256
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I didn't go to the beach with you.

257
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I don't like it.

258
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
You charged me with the battery of the yoga mat.

259
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I don't like it.

260
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Don't say things that don't concern you.

261
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Yamazaki picked up the girls.

262
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
He came back in the car.

263
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:54,000
He was fast.

264
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
He was telling me what to do.

265
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
It was like you were at the scene.

266
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I said I wanted to go to the beach.

267
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I want to go to the beach because I'm a summer guy.

268
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I want to go to the beach.

269
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I don't care.

270
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I'm not doing anything bad.

271
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I want to go to the beach.

272
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I want to make memories of the trip.

273
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I want to do something.

274
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
This is not common for an amateur.

275
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
You're making fun of me.

276
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
You're making fun of my sister.

277
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

278
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I know her.

279
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
What?

280
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:42,000
She's grown up.

281
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
How many of you know her?

282
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
And then...

283
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
You're making fun of me.

284
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:52,000
There was a girl I knew.

285
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,000
And then...

286
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I heard something interesting.

287
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I asked the girl a lot of questions.

288
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
She came to Shonan last year.

289
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
She was a businesswoman.

290
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
She talked to you?

291
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:15,000
She said there was someone who was definitely there, so I asked her to come with me.

292
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I asked her who it was.

293
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
She said it was a celebrity.

294
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I said it wasn't a celebrity.

295
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I asked her to come with me.

296
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,000
She said it wasn't a celebrity.

297
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Hey!

298
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Hey!

299
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
It wasn't a celebrity!

300
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Hey, everyone, come here!

301
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
That's how it went.

302
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I see.

303
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
There were a lot of things.

304
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
But I really...

305
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
This is enough.

306
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
You're making fun of me.

307
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I was at home.

308
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I was basically at home.

309
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Basically?

310
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Yes.

311
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
But you did go.

312
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Well, well...

313
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
That's right.

314
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I didn't really go.

315
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I just...

316
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
How do I say this?

317
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
To put it simply, I didn't go.

318
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
You did go!

319
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
To put it simply...

320
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
You didn't go, you didn't go.

321
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
You didn't go.

322
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I got in a car accident.

323
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
You didn't go.

324
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
You didn't go.

325
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
What car accident?

326
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
It was a 5.2.

327
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

328
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
No, no.

329
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
This is just for the sake of the honor.

330
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
This is really...

331
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Yes, Mr. Kazumoto?

332
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Well, you see, when I work as a comedian,

333
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I have to do a lot of research.

334
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:40,000
So, most of the girls I've taken pictures with are popular now.

335
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
What are you talking about?

336
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,000
That's because you went to the beach.

337
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
That's right.

338
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Ah...

339
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
My comment...

340
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
My comment was wrong.

341
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Yes, yes.

342
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Really.

343
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Yes, yes, yes.

344
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Right?

345
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Ah, the sand...

346
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Ah, the beach.

347
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
When you're driving,

348
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
there's a soldier or a shoe in the middle of the road.

349
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Sometimes there's a blanket on the ground.

350
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Mr. Kazumoto, what does that mean?

351
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
What does that mean?

352
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
You're driving me crazy.

353
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,000
This is something you really have to think about.

354
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Don't be so desperate.

355
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
You have to think seriously about this.

356
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
You have to think seriously about this.

357
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I have something I have to think about, too.

358
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Really.

359
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
It's a big deal.

360
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Mr. Kinpachi.

361
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Mr. Kinpachi.

362
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
This is a big deal.

363
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
A blanket, a soldier, and a shoe.

364
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
What does that mean?

365
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
What does that mean?

366
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
It doesn't have anything to do with the body.

367
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
It doesn't have anything to do with the body.

368
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Why are you so desperate?

369
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
You have to think seriously about this.

370
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
What does that mean?

371
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
A hand and a foot.

372
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Okay.

373
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Well, this is...

374
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
First of all,

375
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
have you ever found a soldier on the road?

376
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Yes, I have.

377
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
You have?

378
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
You have, right?

379
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
No, I haven't.

380
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I haven't.

381
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
You should have.

382
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I should have.

383
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Have you ever seen a soldier on the road while driving?

384
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Yes, I have.

385
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:54,000
This is a message for you.

386
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
What?

387
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Are you okay?

388
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Everyone is a soldier, right?

389
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
That's right.

390
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
That's the difference.

391
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Is that so?

392
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
That's right.

393
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
That's a message.

394
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Why have you ignored it all this time?

395
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
That's annoying.

396
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
You want to come over there?

397
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
On the other hand,

398
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I can't help but get angry.

399
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I'm sorry about that.

400
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I can't help but get angry.

401
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Right?

402
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Don't do that again.

403
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Okay.

404
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
This is a long story.

405
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Tell me the message.

406
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Let's ask him.

407
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Let's ask him more directly.

408
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Did you use your left hand or your right hand?

409
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I didn't look at it carefully.

410
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Maybe I used my left hand.

411
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Soldiers don't use their left hand and right hand, right?

412
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
That's not true.

413
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
When I was doing this,

414
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I felt pain.

415
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
You lied to me just now.

416
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
I don't like this story anymore.

417
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
No matter how I look at it,

418
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
you lied to me.

419
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
That's not true.

420
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
No matter how I look at it,

421
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I feel pain when I do this.

422
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,000
You used your left hand, didn't you?

423
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Yes.

424
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
What?

425
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Right?

426
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Yes.

427
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I don't know if you use your left hand or your right hand,

428
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
but I use my left hand.

429
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Which one is better?

430
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I got it.

431
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I'm sorry.

432
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I don't want to use my left hand or my right hand anymore.

433
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I don't want to use my left hand anymore.

434
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Which one is better?

435
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I don't want to use my left hand anymore.

436
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I'm sorry.

437
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
All the things that were falling down,

438
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
they're all dead.

439
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Are you okay?

440
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
What do you mean by that?

441
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
When you get out of the car,

442
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
a lot of things are falling down.

443
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
You didn't notice that,

444
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
but they're all dead.

445
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Do you understand?

446
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I see.

447
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Yes.

448
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
For example,

449
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
a soldier's hand is falling down.

450
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Right?

451
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
A soldier's hand is falling down.

452
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,000
And a lot of things are falling down.

453
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
There are a lot of things in between.

454
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Of course.

455
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
A soldier's hand doesn't suddenly fall down.

456
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
And...

457
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
How do you explain that you did it?

458
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
That's right.

459
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Why do you think that Shiritori is following you?

460
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Yes, yes.

461
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
You think that, right?

462
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I think so.

463
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
You think that, right?

464
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Wait a minute.

465
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
It's old.

466
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I don't understand.

467
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Why do you think that?

468
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
You don't understand that?

469
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I don't understand that.

470
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
But you know that Shiritori is following you.

471
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I know that.

472
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
That's great.

473
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
No one will notice that.

474
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Yes, yes, yes.

475
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
After the military service,

476
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
they sell you a hand mirror.

477
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
What's next?

478
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Well,

479
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
usually,

480
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
you know,

481
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:11,000
they sell you a pair of earrings.

482
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
And then,

483
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,000
they sell you shoes.

484
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
And then,

485
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
usually,

486
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
you know,

487
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
they sell you a pair of wings.

488
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
And then,

489
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
you know,

490
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
they sell you a mask.

491
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
And then,

492
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
usually,

493
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
you know,

494
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
they sell you a scarf.

495
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Yes, yes, yes.

496
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
You know,

497
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
they sell you a scarf.

498
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
It's impossible.

499
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
The scarf is...

500
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
I have to finish it.

501
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
I have to finish it.

502
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
I have to finish it.

503
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
It's not a scarf.

504
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Well,

505
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
usually,

506
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
they sell you a condom.

507
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Oh, a condom.

508
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
And then,

509
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
they sell you a muumuu.

510
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
It's impossible.

511
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
It's impossible.

512
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
They sell you a muumuu for adults.

513
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
What?

514
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
For children?

515
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
For children?

516
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
In your body,

517
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
there is a left-handed psycho gun.

518
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
It seems that there are seven weapons inside.

519
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
What are the other six?

520
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
And whose hands were they inside?

521
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
It's a sad past, but please tell me.

522
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
If I take this off, it's a psycho gun.

523
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Then, take it off.

524
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
No, no, no, no.

525
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
I can't take it off.

526
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
You have to push and turn it.

527
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Oh, I see.

528
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
That's right.

529
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I can't take it off like this.

530
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
I can't wait.

531
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
You have to push and turn it to take it off.

532
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Oh, I see.

533
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
You have to push both buttons at the same time.

534
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
You have to push both buttons at the same time.

535
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Oh, there are buttons here.

536
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Yes, there are two.

537
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
So, you can't take it off even if you push only one.

538
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
You have to push it hard.

539
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Yes, yes, yes.

540
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
In the past, it was easy to take it off.

541
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Tell the doctor to do it a little bit more.

542
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Doctor?

543
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Tell him to take it off in three actions.

544
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
It's a doctor's song.

545
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Then, take it off.

546
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
No, no, no.

547
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
You can't do that.

548
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
What's this?

549
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
So, the bullets are coming out?

550
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
If you take it off?

551
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Yes, yes, yes.

552
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
That's basically it.

553
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
And you can change about six more.

554
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
You don't have to sing.

555
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
So, I don't use that much.

556
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
In fact, I use something else.

557
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Oh, there's something you use.

558
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Yes, there is.

559
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Even now?

560
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,000
The thing I use the most is the wine extractor.

561
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
You're so sad.

562
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
It's like this.

563
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,000
You're using my arm to make wine.

564
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
It's like this.

565
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Is that your request?

566
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Yes, yes, yes.

567
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
It's like this.

568
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:17,000
But you have to turn it yourself.

569
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Why?

570
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Turn this way.

571
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
What?

572
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Why?

573
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
I don't want to do this.

574
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Why do I have to turn it myself?

575
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
That's what you use the most?

576
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
That's what I use the most.

577
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
And there's something else.

578
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
If it's like this, it's like a mirror.

579
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:38,000
It's like the back of your teeth.

580
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Leave it to the dentist.

581
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
It doesn't matter if it's there or not.

582
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
That's not convenient.

583
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Oh, that was it.

584
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
That's not there anymore.

585
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
What do you mean?

586
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:21,000
It's like magic.
