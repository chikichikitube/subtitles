1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Chikichi's over-manager Fujiwara

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I'm so sorry for that

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Ken-sho

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Good job Fujiwara

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Do you wanna say something?

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
There was a word called Ka

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I see

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Over-manager

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
What is it?

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
You said it in the talk

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
You said it

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Over-manager Fujiwara

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
When I went to work the other day

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I wanted to take the expressway

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
But the expressway was closed due to snow

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
So I called the over-manager Fujiwara

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I called him to ask him if he could send me the expressway

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
He said the expressway was closed due to snow

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I said I'm so sorry

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I didn't mean to call him like that

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I said I'm going to the toilet

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
He said yes

23
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I don't want you to think it's a joke

24
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I don't want you to think it's a joke

25
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I didn't say anything

26
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I went to the toilet

27
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I said yes

28
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I went to the toilet

29
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I went to the toilet

30
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
You are the over-manager

31
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Let's see the over-manager Fujiwara

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,000
This program is brought to you by these sponsors

33
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Fujiwara doesn't know anything and keeps waiting for the guests

34
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
The over-manager Fujiwara is waiting in another place

35
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
The test for the over-manager Fujiwara is about to begin

36
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,000
There are four types of over-manager

37
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
The first type is the over-manager

38
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
The second type is the over-manager

39
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
If you don't know what the over-manager is

40
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
You will be sent to the front

41
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I see

42
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I don't know what the over-manager is

43
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
It's called the over-manager

44
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
If you talk to Fujiwara or Mr. Takasu

45
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
You will be able to communicate with them

46
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I've done it before

47
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
You've done it before?

48
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I've done it before

49
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I've done it before

50
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I've done it before

51
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I've done it before

52
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I've done it before

53
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Have you seen this before?

54
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I don't know this

55
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Have you seen this before?

56
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Mr.Yanaka and I were talking and he asked me to give him the over-manager

57
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Then

58
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
He asked Fujiwara to give him the over-manager

59
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
And then

60
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
You are so mean

61
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
That's how it is

62
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
He looks exactly like Fujiwara

63
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
He is so good

64
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
He is so good

65
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
He is so good

66
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I'm sorry

67
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
And

68
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Ideal type

69
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
He is so good

70
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I'm working on the toilet

71
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I have to go somewhere far

72
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I don't know where it is

73
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I'll do it

74
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
It's not like this

75
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
It's broken

76
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
It's broken

77
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I'll buy it

78
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I'll buy it

79
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
And

80
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
This

81
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I'm a fool

82
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
And

83
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I'll buy it

84
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
It's funny

85
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
It happens

86
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Anyway

87
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I have to go

88
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
He is on the monitor

89
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
He is on the monitor

90
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Fujiwara is waiting for 2 hours

91
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
He is waiting for 2 hours

92
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
He is waiting for 2 hours

93
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I'm sorry

94
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I have to go

95
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
He says he is sorry

96
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
He is on the way

97
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
He calls Fujiwara

98
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Will he apologize?

99
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I'm sorry

100
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Hello

101
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Hello

102
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Masumoto

103
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Hello

104
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I'm busy

105
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I'm sorry

106
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
It's cold

107
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
It's cold

108
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I don't know

109
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Why is it so cold?

110
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I'm sorry

111
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I'm sorry

112
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Tell me

113
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I understand

114
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Tell me

115
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I'm sorry

116
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I'm sorry

117
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
What are you doing?

118
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
If

119
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
It's cold

120
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
It's cold

121
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I'm sorry

122
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I'm sorry

123
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I'm sorry

124
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I'm sorry

125
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
The real test starts

126
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
First, he enters the venue in the order of Yamaizaki and Kogoriko

127
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Then, 15 minutes later, Hamada arrives

128
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Finally, he shows up

129
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Fujiwara doesn't apologize

130
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Fujiwara doesn't apologize

131
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
What kind of test will he do next?

132
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I'm sorry

133
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I'm sorry

134
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I'm sorry

135
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I'm sorry

136
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Good morning

137
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Good morning

138
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Fujiwara

139
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
This cheese is too strong

140
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Do you want to try it?

141
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Fujiwara

142
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Why are you laughing?

143
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Fujiwara leaves the room to make a phone call

144
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
The writer, Takasu, follows him and approaches him

145
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:58,000
This is his specialty, arm wrestling

146
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
When are you free?

147
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
When are you going?

148
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Really?

149
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Let's go play

150
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Let's go

151
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Yamazaki

152
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I heard that you are doing arm wrestling

153
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
What is it?

154
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Next, he expresses himself

155
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I'm sorry

156
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
What are you talking about?

157
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I'm sorry

158
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
This is strange

159
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:56,000
He said that he put his tongue out before, but it was a big failure

160
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Finally, Matsumoto stands up for the toilet

161
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,000
The final test is the ultimate hand-pulling

162
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Where is the toilet?

163
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
It's over there

164
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Thank you

165
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
He keeps talking

166
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:35,000
He doesn't even look back

167
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:41,000
The final test

168
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
He doesn't look happy at all

169
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
He doesn't look happy at all

170
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
He doesn't even look down

171
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
He did it

172
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:13,000
The final test

173
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Everyone is trying their best and putting up a ccd

174
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Why are you apologizing?

175
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I'm sorry

176
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I'm sorry
