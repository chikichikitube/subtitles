1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
From now on, I won't use your money!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hooray!

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Everyone, listen to me.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
What is it?

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm sorry, but I came in two hours earlier than usual.

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
This is my selfishness, but...

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Yamazaki isn't here today, is he?

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
No, he isn't.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Actually, only I knew about it.

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
To put it simply...

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I don't know if you'll believe me, but...

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
He's not human.

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I'm sure you're the first one to find out.

16
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
When I went to the apartment, that's what happened.

17
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
What is this?

18
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
What are you doing?

19
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Yamazaki, hey!

20
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I looked up the dictionary.

21
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,000
When you say a cold, it's supposed to hit a baraka.

22
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
A baraka?

23
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:09,000
A baraka is a far away baraka.

24
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:16,000
If you don't return it to Yamazaki, it won't work.

25
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Yamazaki?

26
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I can't buy it like this.

27
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
No, you can't.

28
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
No, I can't.

29
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I wanted to buy it, but I can't in the winter.

30
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
It's hard.

31
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I have to buy it every night.

32
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I have to buy jelly every night, so I have to buy it quickly.

33
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
No, you can't.

34
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I'll put it in the basket and return it.

35
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,000
You can take it, but if you leave it there, what will happen?

36
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Should I take it out from here?

37
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:59,000
It's in, so you can take it out.

38
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Miyo!

39
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Miyo!

40
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Miyo!

41
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Miyo!

42
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Miyo!

43
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Miyo!

44
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Miyo!

45
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Miyo!

46
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Miyo!

47
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:27,000
It's hard for me too.

48
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I'll put it in the basket and take it.

49
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I'm feeling good, so I'm sleeping.

50
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
You've been lying to us.

51
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
You're surprised.

52
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I'm hungry.

53
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Let's do something.

54
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Let's do it.

55
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
What are you doing?

56
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
What are you doing?

57
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:25,000
What are you doing?

58
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
It's dangerous.

59
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
What's that?

60
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
What's that?

61
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
What's that?

62
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Is that you?

63
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Father and mother.

64
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Where are you going?

65
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Amazake!

66
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Let's go home.

67
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Are you okay?

68
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I'm fine.

69
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Let's go home.

70
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Is it around here?

71
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
It's around here.

72
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I wonder if it's alive.

73
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Can you take care of it in the forest?

74
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Amazake!

75
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Come here!

76
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Amazake!

77
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Amazake!

78
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Amazake!

79
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,000
It's not here.

80
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
It's not here.

81
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
This is fine.

82
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
This is fine.

83
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
It's a small animal, so it's okay.

84
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Amazake is a heavy animal.

85
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Is it okay?

86
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
It's cute.

87
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I bought it for fun.

88
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
It's just a small animal, so it's okay.

89
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:19,000
It's cute.

90
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:33,000
It's cute, but it's better to be careful.

91
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I wonder what it is.

92
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
It's chasing me.

93
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
The way it moves is strange.

94
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,000
It's you.

95
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
It's moving.

96
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I can't hear the sound.

97
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Come here!

98
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Amazake!

99
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Amazake!

100
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Amazake!

101
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Amazake!

102
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Amazake!

103
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Amazake!

104
00:07:51,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Amazake!

105
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Let's go home.

106
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Ladies and gentlemen.

107
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I can't speak because I ate too much.

108
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I can't speak because I ate too much.

109
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I can't speak because I ate too much.

110
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I found it.

111
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
What are you going to do?

112
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
What is it?

113
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I'm going to play a game.

114
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
A game?

115
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Yes.

116
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I'll ask the staff to play a game.

117
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
What are you going to do?

118
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Are you going to play a game?

119
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
If you don't play a game, you can say it.

120
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Let's do it.

121
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Let's do it.

122
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
What are you going to do?

123
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I can't beat Takadobi.

124
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I lost and went to the shrimp shop.

125
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
What are you going to do?

126
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I don't care what you do this time.

127
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Really?

128
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Yes.

129
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
What is it?

130
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Shall we do a marathon?

131
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I don't care about that.

132
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Can I decide?

133
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
No.

134
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:54,000
You're going to beat Takadobi.

135
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I'm going to decide this time.

136
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Tetris.

137
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I'm really good at Tetris.

138
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I'm really good at Tetris.

139
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I can't do it.

140
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I was called Tetris.

141
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I don't know about that.

142
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I don't play Tetris.

143
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
You don't play Tetris.

144
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Let's do it.

145
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Let's do a marathon.

146
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I don't want to see a marathon.

147
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Why?

148
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I'm sorry to the people who do it.

149
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Why?

150
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I'm an idol.

151
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I don't like it.

152
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
My father is shaking.

153
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
You're fat.

154
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
If you're fat, your father will shake.

155
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I'm not good at shaking on TV.

156
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
What are you talking about?

157
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
You're talking about Katsuki.

158
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
You did it last time.

159
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I'm not good at shaking.

160
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Let's do a marathon.

161
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I'm going to take a break from the marathon.

162
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Why?

163
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I'm going to take a break today.

164
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Why?

165
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I have a promise.

166
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
This is a promise.

167
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I'll make a promise before that.

168
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Not before that.

169
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I'm making a promise now.

170
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Let's stop the marathon.

171
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Why?

172
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
No.

173
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
You're going to lose.

174
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Let me challenge you.

175
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
You know you're going to lose, so you're going to challenge me.

176
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
That's right.

177
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
If you win, I'll say, you're pretty good.

178
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Is that the end?

179
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Why do I have to do it?

180
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
You can't do a marathon.

181
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
How many times do I have to do it?

182
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I won't forgive you for being so selfish.

183
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I drank last time.

184
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Let's do a marathon.

185
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
No.

186
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Let's do a marathon.

187
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Why?

188
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
It's better to run a long distance.

189
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
You've been running for three years.

190
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Why?

191
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Wait.

192
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
You have the confidence to jump high.

193
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
You're going to challenge me.

194
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I don't know why you're doing this.

195
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,000
You're the one who doesn't know why.

196
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
This time, I'll take my opinion.

197
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I'll say it's a marathon.

198
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
It's not decided yet.

199
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
It's a marathon as a plan.

200
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Let's take a break.

201
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I'm 100 meters away.

202
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Well, a marathon is fine.

203
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I'm 100 meters away.

204
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
You're 10 kilometers away.

205
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Let's take a break.

206
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I'll take it by hand.

207
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I'm not going to do it now.

208
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Let's do it for the first time.

209
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Let's not do a marathon.

210
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Let's do it.

211
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
It's not a big deal.

212
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
It's not a big deal.

213
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Where are you going?

214
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Marathon.

215
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Then you should stop the marathon.

216
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Stop my opinion.

217
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
It's not a big deal.

218
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Marathon is no good.

219
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
No, no, no, no.

220
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
That's not the case.

221
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
So now my opinion is a marathon.

222
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
So I'm not saying I'm going to decide here.

223
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I'll talk to you again when I'm shooting the next one.

224
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I'm just saying it now.

225
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
It's a marathon.

226
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
It's a marathon.

227
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
If you don't do it, it won't make any sense.

228
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:09,000
You were so confident at that time.

229
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
It's a marathon.

230
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
It's a marathon.

231
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Let's decide the penalty.

232
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Penalty.

233
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Let's decide the penalty first.

234
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Penalty.

235
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
What is it?

236
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Let's do something dangerous.

237
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I'm going to do something life-threatening.

238
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
You're not doing anything.

239
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
You've done a lot of things like riding a motorcycle.

240
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
You.

241
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Tell me if you really did it.

242
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Did you do it?

243
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I didn't do it.

244
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
You don't know anything.

245
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
How many things have I done so far?

246
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Think about it.

247
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
12 years of entertainment life.

248
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Fight with bears.

249
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Tell me if you really did it.

250
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
You went up the stairs on a motorcycle.

251
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
That's obvious.

252
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
That's obvious.

253
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
You have to do something.

254
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
It's okay.

255
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
If you lose, do it.

256
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
That's.

257
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
That.

258
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
It's hard to go abroad for a week.

259
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
So.

260
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I'm going to make a runaway group with one person.

261
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
That.

262
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
The name of the group.

263
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I'm going to blow it up naked.

264
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I'm going to catch it.

265
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I'm going to blow it up naked.

266
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I'm going to blow it up naked.

267
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
But you have to think about it little by little.

268
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
It's already the end of November.

269
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
It's already the end of December.

270
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I can't decide next week.

271
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I can't decide.

272
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I can't decide next week.

273
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
So.

274
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
You should practice now.

275
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I can't do it.

276
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:57,000
But that's your...

277
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I'm not going to do it.

278
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Don't say that.

279
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Don't say that.

280
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I'm not saying anything good right now.

281
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Who's saying anything good?

282
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
So what are you going to do about the punishment game?

283
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Punishment game?

284
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
So that's it.

285
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
It's dangerous.

286
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
It's more dangerous than skydiving.

287
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
What?

288
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Tiger and skydiving.

289
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
How do you live with a tiger?

290
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,000
So there's a parachute attached to the tiger.

291
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
There's nothing to judge him.

292
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
So you're going to drop it.

293
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
With your body.

294
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
If you attach a parachute to the tiger, it will fall.

295
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
If you want to be saved, you have to be bitten by the tiger.

296
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:42,000
If you get bitten.

297
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Don't say anything good right now.

298
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Don't say anything good right now.

299
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Don't say anything good right now.

300
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Don't say anything good right now.

301
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Skydiving is okay.

302
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Don't do it again.

303
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Skydiving is okay.

304
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
It's as scary as skydiving.

305
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Then do bungee jumping.

306
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:58,000
You say things like that, but...

307
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I want to see your partner taking a dump.

308
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I don't know if I'm going to take a dump or not.

309
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I know myself best.

310
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I'm definitely a man who takes a dump.

311
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
If you're going to take a dump, I'll do it.

312
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I'll do it.

313
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I can't take a dump.

314
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I know I'm going to take a dump.

315
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
It's sad.

316
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I took a dump.

317
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
It's okay.

318
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
When you were on top of the skydiving,

319
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I was shaking my butt.

320
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
You were shaking your butt.

321
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I don't know if I'm going to take a dump or not.

322
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
No, no.

323
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I've been there a lot.

324
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
One.

325
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Zero.

326
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Oh, it's in seconds.

327
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Five.

328
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I was talking to a foreigner by ear.

329
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
What are you doing on Christmas?

330
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,000
What?

331
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
What are you doing on Christmas?

332
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Why?

333
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Why are you asking me while you're embarrassed?

334
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I don't feel like I'm embarrassed.

335
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I think about it every year.

336
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Everyone is excited about Christmas.

337
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Tell me what you're doing on Christmas.

338
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I'm doing something because it's Christmas.

339
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
There's nothing to do.

340
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:25,000
If that's the case, I'll know what to do on New Year's Eve.

341
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
It's decided.

342
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
It's decided.

343
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
There's something I have to do.

344
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
On Christmas, my girlfriend said,

345
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Are you free on New Year's Eve?

346
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I said, Yes, I'm free.

347
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I know what you're going to say.

348
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I have to do it on New Year's Eve.

349
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I know what you're going to say.

350
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I know what you're going to say.

351
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
But on Christmas, she said she was free.

352
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I said, Yes, I'm free.

353
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,000
What am I supposed to do with her?

354
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I light a fire with a cake.

355
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
You're too particular about that cake.

356
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
That's right.

357
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
All couples do that with their lovers.

358
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:14,000
They all break their bones like this.

359
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
They hand a cake to the person holding it.

360
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
And keep going.

361
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
And then they hand it to her.

362
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Everyone can take it.

363
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Just let them take it.

364
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
What, you're going to say thank you?

365
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
No, you're going to leave it alone.

366
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
It's about 2 minutes.

367
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
If you include the whole thing, it's 5 minutes.

368
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
If you say that Christmas is open,

369
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
what do you say?

370
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
It's over, isn't it?

371
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Even so, it's over, isn't it?

372
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
No, so Christmas...

373
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,000
For example, I want you to be with me all day long.

374
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I want you to be with me.

375
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
What is it?

376
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I don't want to tell you that I'm a manly student.

377
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,000
If you say something interesting, I won't tell you that I'm an amateur.

378
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
You're like an amateur.

379
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
But this day is Christmas.

380
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
It's cute.

381
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
This day is Christmas.

382
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
So it's a little different, isn't it?

383
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
It's a little different from normal sex.

384
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
It's a little different from normal sex.

385
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
It's a little different from normal sex.

386
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
It's a little different from normal sex.

387
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
If you're taking a picture,

388
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,000
you'll be stuck in the window where you can see the night view.

389
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
It's already 10 o'clock.

390
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
It's a candle.

391
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Candle.

392
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Who is the person who is secretly hiding in the corner of the sewing box?

393
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,000
I don't know at all.

394
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Does this have a face?

395
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Do you know?

396
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
No, I know that.

397
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Please tell me.

398
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
This is a strange way of asking questions.

399
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Why?

400
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Who is the person who is secretly hiding in the corner of the sewing box?

401
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I'm not secretly hiding.

402
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Who is the person who is secretly hiding in the corner of the sewing box?

403
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
It's not a person, is it?

404
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
It's like this.

405
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
It's a pink lady.

406
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
It's Mii-chan and Kei-chan.

407
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
It's a person like this.

408
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
It's a person like this.

409
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
It's a person like this.

410
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
It's a person like this.

411
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
It's a person like this.

412
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
It's a person like this.

413
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
It's a person like this.

414
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
It's a person like this.

415
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
It's a person like this.

416
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Who is the richest person in the entertainment world?

417
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
It's Sabu-chan.

418
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Sabu-chan is really rich.

419
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Sabu-chan's house is huge.

420
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
It's not just one, is it?

421
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
It's not just one, is it?

422
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Probably.

423
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
There are many places.

424
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
There are many places.

425
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
There are many places.

426
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
But the main house is amazing.

427
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
The main house stands up.

428
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
And there are many hot springs.

429
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
And there are many hot springs.

430
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Is it scattered?

431
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
It's scattered.

432
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
It's amazing.

433
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
It's amazing.

434
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Please say something to us.

435
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Please say something to us.

436
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Please say something to us.

437
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
The main house is bad.

438
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
The main house is bad.

439
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Where did you come from?

440
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Where did you come from?

441
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Where did you come from?

442
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
It stinks.

443
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
It's cold.

444
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
It's cold.

445
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
It's cold.

446
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
It's okay.

447
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
It's okay.

448
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:27,000
It's okay.
