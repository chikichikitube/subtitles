00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Chikichiki Quiz! Find the Zura! Grand Prix!

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
This time, it's called the Find the Zura! Grand Prix.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Which one of us is wearing the zura?

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Simply put, who is the real one?

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Let's do it!

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
First, we'll introduce the answer.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
From here, it's Mr. Fuyuki Motoh!

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Mr. Fuyuki, don't you usually do anything?

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I usually wear a mesh wig.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I don't usually do that.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Next, we have Strong Kongo!

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Kongo, you don't usually wear the zura, right?

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I've been doing it for 8 years, but I've never worn a wig.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Are you wearing it?

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Yes, I'm wearing it.

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Kongo, you have one, right?

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Yes, I've been wearing it for 3 years.

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Today, I've prepared something like this.

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Kongo, you're wearing it.

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Oh my!

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
What a big head!

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
You look like Koike-san.

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Lastly, we have Mr. Matsumoto, the Find the Zura!

24
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Hello, good evening.

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
You're the one who's wearing the zura, right?

26
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I've been looking through a lot of people.

27
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
You're the one who's wearing the zura?

28
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
There are people who can't see through it.

29
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
You know that, but you can't say it out loud.

30
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
There are people in the entertainment industry who can't say it out loud.

31
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Oh, is that so?

32
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
There are a lot of people in the entertainment industry who can't say it out loud.

33
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I've been checking it out.

34
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
What do you have?

35
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
How to sweat.

36
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Oh, if you're wearing it, how do you sweat?

37
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Why are you sweating from here?

38
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:44,000
This program is brought to you by the following sponsors.

39
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Let's go to the first question!

40
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
The first question is a question about VTR.

41
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Everyone, please look at the monitor.

42
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Go ahead!

43
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
VTR, VTR.

44
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Let's go!

45
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
VTR, VTR.

46
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Let's go to the first question!

47
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Let's go! The first question is a VTR question.

48
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Everyone, please look at the monitor.

49
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Well, I went out to Shinjuku, Tokyo.

50
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Is this person a zura?

51
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
This is not a zura.

52
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Well, there are four people walking around the city of Shinjuku.

53
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I brought a little.

54
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Well, let's go.

55
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Is it number one, number two, number three, number four?

56
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
First of all, it's a light question.

57
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
How many of these four people are wearing a wig?

58
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Number four is too wig-like.

59
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
This is a lie.

60
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I see, I see.

61
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Well, everyone, number one, number two, number three, number four, please.

62
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Number one.

63
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Is that a zura?

64
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
The most difficult to understand.

65
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Well, well.

66
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I understand.

67
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Now, Mr. Hongo.

68
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Yes, I am.

69
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
You've got a big hole.

70
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
This is.

71
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Depending on the type of maker, there are various types of wigs.

72
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Yes, yes, yes.

73
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I feel like it's the most wig-like wig.

74
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
That can't be helped.

75
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
That can't be helped.

76
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Now, Zura Miyaburiman.

77
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Number two.

78
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Partially, he's wearing a thin one.

79
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I think that's the most natural way to deceive.

80
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
He's wearing a thin one.

81
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Well, number one, number four, number two.

82
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Now, let's see the correct answer.

83
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
This person.

84
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Well, for the time being, I'll send you the wind.

85
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Zura.

86
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
That's not it.

87
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
It doesn't fly.

88
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
This?

89
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
That's not it.

90
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
It's a wig.

91
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:15,000
It's a wig.

92
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
That's why the correct answer is number four, Mr. Hongo.

93
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Correct.

94
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Well, then.

95
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
The second question!

96
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
The second question will actually be lined up here.

97
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Let's get started.

98
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Now, we have 5 people lined up.

99
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
You don't have to do the mantle.

100
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
The problem is the head, but you can do the mantle.

101
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
If you have any questions.

102
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
The first person.

103
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Yes, the first person.

104
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Is that a mantle?

105
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
No!

106
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Who is it?

107
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Who is it?

108
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I don't know.

109
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Yes.

110
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Mr. Kongo.

111
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Wake up in the morning.

112
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Yes.

113
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Tell me the time until the time is up.

114
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
From the first person.

115
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I see, the time to prepare.

116
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Are you wearing a mantle?

117
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Can you wear it off in about 30 seconds?

118
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Wear it off?

119
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Is it a technical term?

120
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Wear it off?

121
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Normally, you don't wear it off, do you?

122
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Is that so?

123
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
What about the second person?

124
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Wear it off for about a minute.

125
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
About a minute.

126
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
What about the third person?

127
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
About 10 seconds.

128
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
10 seconds?

129
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
What about the fourth person?

130
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
About 10 minutes.

131
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
10 minutes?

132
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
What about the fifth person?

133
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
About 30 minutes.

134
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
It takes 30 minutes?

135
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
It seems to take 30 minutes.

136
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
You have a good face, so you should wear makeup.

137
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
What are you talking about?

138
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
The first 5 people lined up like this.

139
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I was holding it like this.

140
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Please take a good look at me.

141
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Here comes Mr. Kongo.

142
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I'll show you how to do it with a big mouth.

143
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
With a big mouth like this.

144
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
With a big mouth like this.

145
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Like this.

146
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
From the first to the fifth person.

147
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
How many people are wearing a katsura?

148
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Please take a good look at me.

149
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Everyone is here.

150
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Let's start with Mr. Fuyuki.

151
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Number 5.

152
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I don't think the first person is the same.

153
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
What about you?

154
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I don't think the second person is the same.

155
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I don't know.

156
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Number 5 for now.

157
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Mr. Kongo.

158
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Number 3.

159
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Why?

160
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
It looks like a thick and small hair.

161
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,000
It feels like a mixture of a beard and a katsura.

162
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I see.

163
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Number 3 in that sense.

164
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Zura Miyaburiman.

165
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Number 5.

166
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
The same as Mr. Fuyuki.

167
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Yes.

168
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Why?

169
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I don't think he has hair all over his body.

170
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Don't say stupid things.

171
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Let's see the correct answer.

172
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Number 3.

173
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Amazing.

174
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Number 3.

175
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Mr. Kongo is correct.

176
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I thought he didn't have a hard hair.

177
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I see.

178
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
It's true.

179
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Other people have natural hair, but he has a little bit of hair.

180
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
So I think he has a lot of hair.

181
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
His face changes when he takes it off.

182
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
His face changes.

183
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
He has about 20 hairs.

184
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Mr. Kongo, please take it off.

185
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
The shape is different.

186
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
What if I break it?

187
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
It won't grow back.

188
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
What?

189
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Ladies and gentlemen.

190
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Hello, hello.

191
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,000
This hall is too close.

192
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I don't like it.

193
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
It's always too high.

194
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Punishment.

195
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
It's not funny.

196
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
It's always like this.

197
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,000
What you said, what I said, and what you sent me.

198
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I put them all together.

199
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
But let's make a net.

200
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I think so.

201
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Yes.

202
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Please take it out.

203
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
We'll talk about it later.

204
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Are you ready?

205
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Yes.

206
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Let's start with this side.

207
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I drew it.

208
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
It's pretty rough, isn't it?

209
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
What does it say?

210
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Kangaroo?

211
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Kangaroo and boxing.

212
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Kangaroo?

213
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Kangaroo and boxing.

214
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
It's scary to lose.

215
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
It's like a comedy that killed a kangaroo.

216
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
It's going to be hard in the future, isn't it?

217
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I killed it.

218
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Even if you scream like this,

219
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
that person killed a kangaroo.

220
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
That's right.

221
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
It's going to be hard, isn't it?

222
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:38,000
This is what I want to avoid the most.

223
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
What is this?

224
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Bunchin?

225
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
This is Katsura Bunchin.

226
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
San?

227
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Yes.

228
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I'm going to use it a lot and play with it.

229
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I came up with this.

230
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
What are you going to do?

231
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
For example?

232
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I think the New Year's Day is coming soon.

233
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
We're shooting a New Year's show now.

234
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Yes.

235
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
There's a happy New Year's Day.

236
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
With a big brush.

237
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
You have to shoot from above.

238
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
If the paper moves, I'll have you sit down.

239
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Bone Bunchin?

240
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Yes.

241
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
It's the same.

242
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Semi-nude?

243
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Semi-nude.

244
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
This is interesting.

245
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
If you lose...

246
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Goroh.

247
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Playboy.

248
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Scora.

249
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Semi-nude.

250
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I asked a famous photographer to take a picture of me.

251
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
How much of a semi-nude are you?

252
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I hide my front.

253
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I don't show my butt.

254
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Semi-nude.

255
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
How about this?

256
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
It's good.

257
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Chimpanzee chop.

258
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
This is stupid.

259
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
If you lose, I'll chop you into a chimpanzee.

260
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I don't know what this is.

261
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
What is this?

262
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
This?

263
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
This is difficult.

264
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
What?

265
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Kiyoshi.

266
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Sanshi.

267
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Sanshi-san.

268
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Sanshi or Kiyoshi?

269
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Kiyoshi-san or Sanshi-san.

270
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
This is...

271
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Stop it!

272
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Stop it!

273
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
It's obvious.

274
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
This!

275
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Sorry, I don't know what this is.

276
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
What is it?

277
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
What is this?

278
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Katsura Sanshi Shisho.

279
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Katsura Sanshi Shisho's...

280
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Who are you?

281
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
This is just a simple chimpanzee chop.

282
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I don't know what this is.

283
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Kiyoshi Sanshi.

284
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
What is this?

285
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Kiyoshi Shisho, Sanshi Shisho.

286
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Either one or the other.

287
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Let's play a prank.

288
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I see.

289
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
This is fun.

290
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:55,000
In Sanshi Shisho's case, he goes into Sanshi Shisho's dressing room.

291
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
He goes in before Shisho comes?

292
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Yes.

293
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
He is waiting in Katsura Sanshi's dressing room.

294
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
When Katsura Sanshi comes in, he says,

295
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Welcome.

296
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
This is good.

297
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
This is good.

298
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
In Kiyoshi's case...

299
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
In Kiyoshi's case...

300
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
He goes to his house.

301
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
In Yasu-san's dressing room, he says,

302
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Let's get back together.

303
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
This is fun.

304
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
This is either one or the other.

305
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
But it's really scary.

306
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
That's right.

307
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Bungee jumping.

308
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Bungee jumping.

309
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
This is just like that.

310
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
If you lose, you do it.

311
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Yes.

312
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Silicone.

313
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
You don't put silicone in your chest.

314
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
If you lose.

315
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
You become a very good father.

316
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,000
It's okay to have a comedian like this.

317
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
What is it like to fight in Spain?

318
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:48,000
It's not that simple. It's the sense of fear.

319
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
What is it like to fight in Spain?

320
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
What?

321
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
It's not that simple.

322
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
You know what I mean.

323
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
You know what I mean.

324
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Yes.

325
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
You know what I mean.

326
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
You know what I mean.

327
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
It's not like a fun fight.

328
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Can you do it like Yuki-chan?

329
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
That would be nice.

330
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
If you come.

331
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Like Albus.

332
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I know.

333
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Isn't that a goat?

334
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
It's Tōgyū!

335
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
You know, those guys...

336
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
They can't just pop out like that!

337
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
You have to lift them up, right?

338
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
They have to do it like this!

339
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I know that!

340
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
It's like before their debut.

341
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
It's like before their debut.

342
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Even if it's a penalty game, it's a bit cruel.

343
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
If it wasn't for scary guys, I'd be doing bungee jumping.

344
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
You're doing it like this!

345
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
As expected...

346
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
It's you!

347
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
It's me, huh?

348
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
What's wrong with you?

349
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
It's like that.

350
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
It's Tōgyū from Spain.

351
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Are you scared of the chimpanzee top?

352
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I'm not scared!

353
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
It's just a monkey.

354
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Are you stupid?

355
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
The monkey's claws are amazing.

356
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
It's like this.

357
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
They can't just do it like this.

358
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
You have to lift them up.

359
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I'm the monkey!

360
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I don't know what you're thinking.

361
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
It's okay!

362
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I'm...

363
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I'm...

364
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I'm...

365
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I'm...

366
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I'm...

367
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I'm...

368
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I'm...

369
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I'm...

370
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I'm...

371
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I'm...

372
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Oh, what an creepy...

373
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
It can be anywhere!

374
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
It's...

375
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
It's maybe inside this box?

376
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
You should do it around that effect!

377
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
You should do it around that effect!

378
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
ases!

379
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
You must be so stupid!

380
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
In the morning, you should've written down your bites.

381
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
There's no time!

382
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Don't make fun of me!

383
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
It's okay!

384
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
It was really funny!

385
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I know, so I'll choose one

386
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Anywhere?

387
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Let's start from here

388
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Please choose one

389
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Where should I choose?

390
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Anywhere?

391
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Really?

392
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Then...

393
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Stop it, you idiot!

394
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I feel like you're going to do that too

395
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
But wait, why am I doing this?

396
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
So I'm the one who should do it?

397
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I feel like I'm the one who should do it

398
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
If I lose, I'll do it too

399
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
But I'll leave it to you

400
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Here

401
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
What?

402
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Ah, I see

403
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
What is this?

404
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I thought I'd leave it to you

405
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
What do you mean?

406
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
This or that

407
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
You can't do that

408
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
What?

409
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Here

410
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
There's only one mark

411
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Mark?

412
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
There's only one mark

413
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
What are you talking about?

414
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Are you kidding me?

415
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
So here

416
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Here

417
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Here

418
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Can I draw a line?

419
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Sure

420
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Then

421
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Here

422
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Here

423
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I drew a line

424
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
But it went back

425
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
It's meaningless

426
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Right?

427
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Here

428
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Right?

429
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Let's start

430
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Dandara dandara dandara dandara dandara

431
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Dandara dandara dandara dandara dandara

432
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
You can take it

433
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I have to take it

434
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
What should I do from here?

435
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Are you going to put your arm in here?

436
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I was looking forward to it

437
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
So I thought I'd draw a small line

438
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
from here

439
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Take it

440
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Okay

441
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Alright

442
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Dandara dandara dandara dandara dandara

443
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Don't be a fool

444
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Dandara dandara dandara dandara dandara

445
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Dandara dandara dandara dandara

446
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
So that's it

447
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I'll play that penalty game

448
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I think so. Next week, next week, I think I'll get a clear shot on the back of the net.

449
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Let's do our best.

450
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
By the way, that's a big difference.

451
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
It's a golf rule.

452
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Can you tell me about it?

453
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Can you lower it a little bit?

454
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
The golf rule, right?

455
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Yes.

456
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I'll do five holes.

457
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Yes.

458
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I'll do five holes,

459
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
and the one before that, three holes.

460
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I'll win.

461
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
And then?

462
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Yes.

463
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I've prepared a professional for you.

464
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I'll do it.

465
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Is that okay?

466
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Yes.

467
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
A professional.

468
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
A famous professional that anyone can see.

469
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Professional.

470
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Something like that.

471
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Something like that.

472
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Even if it's a professional, it's really a golf professional.

473
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Of course.

474
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
What's the point of calling a professional?

475
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Even if it's a professional, it's like Ajacomb.

476
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Who would call you?

477
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
No one would call me.

478
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
That's no good.

479
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Why?

480
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
That's no good.

481
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
It's like I did something dirty.

482
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I don't like that.

483
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
What would you call me?

484
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Ojiya.

485
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Oh, okay.

486
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
There are people who are good at calling themselves Ojiya.

487
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
There are people who are good at calling themselves Ojiya,

488
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
but there are people who have never called themselves Ojiya.

489
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
That's not enough.

490
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Why?

491
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I've never done it before, so I don't know if I'm an old man or an old woman.

492
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I'll write it down.

493
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Seriously?

494
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Okay, I'm sorry.

495
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I'll write it down.

496
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I'll put my finger in here.

497
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,000
This person is good at music and sports.

498
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
He likes watching videos.

499
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:53,000
What kind of videos do you watch?

500
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I didn't say anything bad.

501
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I didn't say anything bad.

502
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I didn't attack you.

503
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
What did you do?

504
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
What kind of videos do you watch?

505
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
The ones that make you cry.

506
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Oh, the ones that make you cry.

507
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I don't think it's that bad.

508
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
What are you talking about?

509
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I don't know.

510
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:16,000
That's right.

511
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Why are you bringing this home?

512
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I'll introduce the postcards.

513
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
This person,

514
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Hamada-san, Matsumoto-san, good evening.

515
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:32,000
This person is a female singer.

516
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
I always enjoy watching her.

517
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
I've thought about the fourth punishment game, so please listen to it.

518
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
In the previous punishment game, Hamada-san used her body.

519
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Matsumoto-san was very embarrassed.

520
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
So this time, using your brain,

521
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
how about taking a college entrance exam?

522
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
This is going to be hard.

523
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
I thought about it for a moment.

524
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
College entrance exam,

525
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
it depends on which university.

526
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:01,000
I'm pretty good at it.

527
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
No, I'm serious.

528
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
I went to a high school.

529
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
I only got bad grades.

530
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
That's not true.

531
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Hyogo is a prefecture.

532
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Prefecture is just a name.

533
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I only got bad grades.

534
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
That's not true.

535
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
I went to an elite high school.

536
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
I was smoking in class.

537
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
That's not true.

538
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:26,000
The teacher was smoking in class.

539
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,000
I thought I shouldn't smoke in a place like this.

540
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:36,000
It's like a school's military district identification card.

541
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
At this point,

542
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
it's finally time to play golf.

543
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
The punishment game has already been decided.

544
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
That's right.

545
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:49,000
If you lose, go to your boyfriend's place.

546
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
That's the rule, isn't it?

547
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
What?

548
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,000
The rule is...

549
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
What?

550
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:04,000
The staff said I should wear a umekichi.

551
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Who is that umekichi?

552
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:13,000
It's an old lady I brought home from the billiards.

553
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Where is the umekichi?

554
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
What?

555
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Where is the umekichi?

556
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Umekichi is at my house.

557
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Is it at your house?

558
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Yes.

559
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
In Tokyo?

560
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Yes.

561
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Really?

562
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
