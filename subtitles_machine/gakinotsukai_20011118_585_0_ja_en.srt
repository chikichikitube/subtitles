1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
In the baseball tournament full of Hamashio, a number of super plays came out, and in the end, the Hamashio team won with a dramatic goodbye home run.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
And once again, the Hamashio team started a new fight.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:31,000
We will now begin the Hamashio Sports Day.

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:55,000
We will now begin the Hamashio Sports Day.

5
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:16,000
We will now begin the Hamashio Sports Day.

00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:40,000
We will now begin the Hamashio Sports Day.

00:01:40,000 --> 00:02:03,000
We will now begin the Hamashio Sports Day.

8
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:28,000
We will now begin the Hamashio Sports Day.

9
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:50,000
We will now begin the Hamashio Sports Day.

10
00:02:50,000 --> 00:03:15,000
We will now begin the Hamashio Sports Day.

11
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:34,000
We will now begin the Hamashio Sports Day.

12
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:45,000
We will now begin the Hamashio Sports Day.

00:03:45,000 --> 00:04:04,000
We will now begin the Hamashio Sports Day.

00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:29,000
We will now begin the Hamashio Sports Day.

00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:56,000
We will now begin the Hamashio Sports Day.

16
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:11,000
We will now begin the Hamashio Sports Day.

00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:26,000
We will now begin the Hamashio Sports Day.

00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:41,000

00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:36,000
We will now begin the Hamashio Sports Day.

22
00:06:36,000 --> 00:07:01,000
We will now begin the Hamashio Sports Day.

23
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Ready!

24
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Ready!

25
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Ready!

26
00:07:46,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Ready!

27
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Ready!

28
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Ready!

29
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Ready!

30
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Ready!

31
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Ready!

32
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Ready!

33
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Ready!

34
00:09:40,000 --> 00:10:05,000
We will now begin the Hamashio Sports Day.

35
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:30,000
We will now begin the Hamashio Sports Day.

00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:55,000
We will now begin the Hamashio Sports Day.

00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:20,000
We will now begin the Hamashio Sports Day.

38
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Ready!

39
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Ready!

40
00:11:45,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Ready!

41
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Ready!

42
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Ready!

43
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Ready!

44
00:12:45,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Ready!

45
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Ready!

46
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:30,000

Ready!

50
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Ready!

51
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Please tell us the story of the dog, monkey, and the fox.

52
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I don't understand this story.

53
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
What do you want to say?

54
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I think you're saying something, but you can't talk in front of people you're not interested in.

55
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I'm answering this for Yamamoto-kun.

56
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Yamamoto-kun, that's strange.

57
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Yamamoto-kun, that's strange.

58
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Yamamoto Takehiro-kun.

59
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Yamamoto Takehiro-kun, that's strange.

60
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Why is that?

61
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I don't understand what you're saying.

62
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
That's because...

63
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
What did the dog, monkey, and the fox do to make you so excited?

64
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
You went to see the monkey, didn't you?

65
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
You didn't?

66
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Is this wrong?

67
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I want to say this first.

68
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
If it's wrong, then you're wrong, Yamamoto.

69
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
This is nothing.

70
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Right?

71
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
What do you think?

72
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
You went to see the monkey, didn't you?

73
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
You went to see the monkey, didn't you?

74
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
You didn't?

75
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,000
To be honest, I can't say that yet.

76
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
When are you going to say it?

77
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I'm going to say it now.

78
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I'm going to say it as if I went.

79
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
What?

80
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I'm going to say it as if I went.

81
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
If you accept it, you can say it.

82
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
What are you talking about?

83
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
What are you talking about?

84
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I'm excited because you did something.

85
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I'm going to say it now.

86
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I'm going to say it now.

87
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I'm going to say it now.

88
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Listen to me, Yamamoto.

89
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Yamamoto, you're like Hirotani.

90
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I'm going to say it now.

91
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
You're going to say it now?

92
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I'm going to say it now.

93
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
You seem to be motivated.

94
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I was motivated.

95
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
But what are these guys?

96
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
This is the worst.

97
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
It's a sad story.

98
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I'm always half laughing.

99
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
That's funny.

100
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Even if I say, I'm going to say it, it's not funny.

101
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:58,000
If I say, only one person will say it, the other will say it, and the other will say it.

102
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I hear it because it's pitiful.

103
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I get really excited.

104
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:04,500
I see.

105
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,000
I can't help but get angry.

106
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
You're saying it.

107
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I'm saying it.

108
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Alright, let's go!

109
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Over there!

110
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I'm saying it.

111
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
When I'm saying it,

112
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
from behind,

113
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I'm like,

114
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
why are you in the peach?

115
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
My face is like this.

116
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
My face is red.

117
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Why are you in the peach?

118
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Like that,

119
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I'm saying it.

120
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I'm getting angry.

121
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I'm saying it.

122
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
That makes you angry, right?

123
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
My tension goes down.

124
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Your tension goes down.

125
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
That's right.

126
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
You should have asked me directly.

127
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
That's right.

128
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I see.

129
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
My face is completely red.

130
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
My face is redder than the red demon.

131
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
My face is redder than the red demon I'm going to meet now.

132
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
That's a bit too much.

133
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Eh?

134
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I should have finished it before that.

135
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
If you keep saying things like this,

136
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
you'll turn into a blue demon.

137
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Hey!

138
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Someone come here!

139
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,000
What is the toilet war that Matsumoto-san thought of?

140
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I thought of it?

141
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Inatsuchi Shota wrote it.

142
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Today's writing is a bit strange.

143
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
It's hard to understand.

144
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
But there is indeed a toilet war.

145
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Is that so?

146
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Yes.

147
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
It's too vague.

148
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
It's hard to understand what it is.

149
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
For example,

150
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
whether it's a big one or a small one.

151
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
What is that?

152
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
What is that?

153
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
If you have something to ask, go ahead.

154
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
No, I don't.

155
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I don't.

156
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
What is that?

157
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I'm more interested in the toilet than my story.

158
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
What is that?

159
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
The toilet seat?

160
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Of course, that's right.

161
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
I see.

162
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Of course, that's right.

163
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Of course, that's right.

164
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Whether it's a big one or a small one,

165
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
it's amazing.

166
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Four people died because of this.

167
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I see.

168
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
That's amazing.

169
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
There is a new type of toilet.

170
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
It's called S type.

171
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
What is S type?

172
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
It's called S type.

173
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
What do you do with it?

174
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
How do you use it?

175
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
It's called S type.

176
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
It's like this.

177
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
It's like this.

178
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Where is the toilet seat?

179
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Where is the toilet seat?

180
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
If there is no toilet door,

181
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
there is nothing.

182
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
There is no toilet door.

183
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
You don't have to force yourself.

184
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I have one.

185
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
You don't have to force yourself.

186
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
What?

187
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
What?

188
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
S type.

189
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
S type.

190
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
How do you use it?

191
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
That's why...

192
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Why do I have to do this all the time?

193
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
This is the toilet seat.

194
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
This is the S type toilet seat

195
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
that has recently been added.

196
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
It's all over the place now.

197
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Do you put your butt here?

198
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I put my butt here.

199
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
You shouldn't be here.

200
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Your butt is here.

201
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
The poop goes all the way here.

202
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
The poop goes all the way here.

203
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I told you that it's hard to clean the toilet.

204
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
My feet are full of poop.

205
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
This is not good.

206
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
That's why I don't need this anymore.

207
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
People become tearful as they age.

208
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,000
What is the most useless thing that you have done recently?

209
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Can I say it seriously?

210
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Of course.

211
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I thought it was the age.

212
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
What happened?

213
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,000
People become tearful as they age.

214
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
That's what I thought.

215
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Seriously.

216
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
What happened?

217
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
You were playing Alien 2, right?

218
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
The complete version.

219
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I watched it three times.

220
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
When was the first time you played it?

221
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
I was about 20 years old.

222
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I don't know.

223
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
You're 38 years old now.

224
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
You should watch Alien 2.

225
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
To be honest,

226
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Schwarzenegger was falling down with a chain.

227
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:36,000
That was Terminator.

228
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Thank you very much.

229
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Let's go home.

230
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
You're old.

231
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
You're not getting any older.

232
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
This is embarrassing.

233
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Say it!

234
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
You didn't play it the other day!

235
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
At that time, you said,

236
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
No, Machan is wrong!

237
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
You guys call Machan by his name, right?

238
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Say it!

239
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:26,000
You made a mess of people.

240
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
We just played Alien.

241
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,000
You guys are so dirty!

242
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
I know you're going to stop it,

243
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
but you shouldn't have stopped it.

244
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
You stopped it and then put a chain on it.

245
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
You call it Alien?

246
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
You didn't play Alien 2 the other day.

247
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
I don't know when you played it.

248
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
When Schwarzenegger came out,

249
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
you should have said it!

250
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
I don't know when he came out.

251
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
When Schwarzenegger came out, you should have said it!

252
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
That was Terminator.

253
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
You're so dirty!

254
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
You made a mistake!

255
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
You should have said,

256
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
No, Machan is wrong!

257
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
You should have said,

258
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
No, Machan is wrong!

259
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
You don't know how to play it anymore, right?

260
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
You don't play Alien 2 anymore.

261
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
You should have said,

262
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
No, Machan is wrong!

263
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
You should have said,

264
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
No, Machan is wrong!

265
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
You don't play Alien 2 anymore.

266
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
You should have said,

267
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
No, Machan is wrong!

268
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
You should have said,

269
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
No, Machan is wrong!

270
00:23:36,000 --> 00:24:05,000
You're so noisy!
