1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Next time, we will have a contest to see who can be the best comedian in Hollywood!

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
The ultimate goal of comedians is to be the best comedian in Hollywood.

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
That's the ultimate goal.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
There are many comedians who can't be the best comedians.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
That's how much I admire him.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Today we will see how close you can get to the Hollywood Zako show.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Is that so?

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:55,000
A contest where everyone's admires and how close you can get to the Hollywood Zako show.

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The winner will be judged by Matsumoto's hand

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The winner will receive a special reward

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Please welcome the members of the Zakoshi family

12
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm Kusotaro the garlic flower.

13
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Bang! Bang!

14
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Goss! Goss!

15
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Fake Zakochi.

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'll let you do that.

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I think it's not enough.

18
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I had a castanet, but I didn't use it much.

19
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I quit in a hurry.

20
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Next, Zakoshi, please.

21
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I am Mr. Maric.

22
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Toge, toge, toge, toge, toge, toge, toge, toge, toge, go!

23
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Fake Zakoshi.

24
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
That's right.

25
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I think I'm not fully in the groove.

26
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
You're not yet.

27
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I think it's a little hard.

28
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Let's go! Next, Sakoshi, please!

29
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Fake Sakoshi.

30
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Please.

31
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Please, take your seat.

32
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
But, when I was in standby, I was still called Jakoshi.

33
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I see.

34
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Let's go! Please welcome, Tsutomu's Zakoshi!

35
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I'm curious!

36
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
What's with this guy?

37
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I'm curious!

38
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
My throat is...

39
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I'm curious!

40
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Business Zakoshi

41
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I think I went a little overboard

42
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
It was the smell of money

43
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,900
broad and very slowly

44
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,900
drawn

45
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:58,700
that's a good start

46
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:04,220
Time up

47
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,620
Zone's equalï¿½

48
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:09,620
It's good, right? You don't have to listen to them.

49
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:10,120
Yes, yes.

50
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:13,120
It's like a mirror training.

51
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,120
It's similar, it's similar.

52
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,120
It's good, right?

53
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,620
It's Shin's target, even during this time.

54
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,620
Then let's do 15 minutes.

55
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:24,120
Yes.

56
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:30,120
It's getting warm.

57
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,120
Yes, it's good, it's good.

58
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:31,620
Yes.

59
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:32,620
The target is...

60
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:39,920
Now after some morew leiw every bloody Vegetine-don is on the menu!

61
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:43,820
MZ Force Zagoshi, you really wanted to do it after your TurkeyçŸ³

62
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:45,820
Ah, well that's about it

63
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:33,720
Now lets start with the challenger

64
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,920
It has to be someone else

65
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:58,220
That!

66
00:04:58,220 --> 00:04:59,520
Not easy

67
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,520
Zagoshi!

68
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,020
Ah really?

69
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:02,300
It's Zagoshi

70
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:06,300
I'll show you that I'm ignoring the rules.

71
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,300
Tanaka Zakoshi!

72
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:09,300
Tanaka Zakoshi.

73
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,300
First of all, please tell us the topic.

74
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:15,300
Well, let's start with Ikko-san.

75
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:19,300
Now, please imitate the voice of Mr.Zakoshi Tanaka!

76
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:40,300
It's not Zakoshi!

77
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:42,300
Good, good.

78
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,300
Even if you get a negative, you still won't give up.

79
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:46,300
Good, good.

80
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:48,300
You'll get a very good feeling.

81
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:50,300
Now, the next one is a little difficult.

82
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:52,300
How about it?

83
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:54,300
Fujimon.

84
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,300
Yes, Fujimon Zako.

85
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:58,300
Oh, Toshihiko-san.

86
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:00,300
Please take care of Toshi-chan.

87
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:02,300
I see.

88
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,300
This is Osamu-chan.

89
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:40,300
I think it's a good idea.

90
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,300
Then, Masumoto-san, please do the endo-zakoshi.

91
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,300
Oh, endo-zakoshi, good.

92
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,300
Then, let's do the old-fashioned ninja-bou.

93
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:48,300
This is...

94
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,300
Let's do it like this.

95
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:53,300
Hamamase-mukanma!

96
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:56,300
Hamatte-kimudamakanma!

97
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:59,300
Uuuuuuu...

98
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:03,300
Houmugi-ganji-hikoumako-koum...

99
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:06,300
It's a blur.

100
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,300
Please turn around.

101
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:13,300
Let's go with Non-chan Zagoshi.

102
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,300
Let's start from the body type.

103
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:19,300
Let's go with Morishinichi-san.

104
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:26,300
Why is everyone like Osamu-san?

105
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:37,920
1983, probably a efforts 2004, plenty

106
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:40,420
Common goza

107
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:42,920
hydraulile

108
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:47,320
Country

109
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,720
In Japanese

110
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,720
I'm sorry.

111
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,720
Now, Tawara Toshiko.

112
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,720
I'm sorry.

113
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,720
He's back.

114
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,720
He's back.

115
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,720
What?

116
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,720
Commentator smeared with a disaster

117
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:17,640
Nette

118
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:18,680
Thers

119
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:22,780
No

120
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:31,000
It was about Live

121
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:32,780
Look everyone

122
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:34,420
Was the feeling

123
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:35,740
Let's go to the Cryptography

124
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:38,420
principle

125
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:43,420
Ko-mo and Zakoshi will go with Antonio Inoki.

126
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:48,420
Ah, that's good.

127
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:51,420
Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!

128
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:53,420
Zakoshi-chan!

129
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:56,420
That's a little different.

130
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:00,420
It's over.

131
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:03,420
It's over.

132
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:05,420
It's over.

133
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:08,420
Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!

134
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:10,420
Then, Fujimoto.

135
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:20,420
Then, Michael Jackson.

136
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:25,420
.

137
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:26,420

141
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:30,420

142
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:31,420
.

143
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:32,420
.

144
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:33,420
.

145
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:34,420
.

146
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:37,420
Who's bad?

147
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:38,420
.

148
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:39,420
.

149
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:40,420

150
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:41,420

151
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:42,420

152
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:43,420

153
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:44,420

154
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:45,420

155
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:46,420

156
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:47,420

157
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,420
.

158
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:49,420
.

159
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:51,420
What is this?

160
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:53,420
Let's go with Takeda Tetsuya-san

161
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:54,420
I see

162
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:57,420
Hama! Hama Mae!

163
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:02,420
Hama Mae!

164
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:05,420
What is this?

165
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:07,420
Hama Mae!

166
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:10,420
What is this?

167
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:12,420
This is so fun!

168
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:14,420
That was great.

169
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:21,420
At first, I was a little worried, but you were able to get it back.

170
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:23,420
That was great.

171
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:25,420
How about Takashi Tanaka?

172
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:28,420
Well, Takashi Tanaka is...

173
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:32,420
How about Naoki Hanzawa?

174
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:34,920
Yes.

175
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:41,420
Yes, it's Guzuwa.

176
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:42,920
Yes, it's Guzuwa.

177
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:43,920
That's enough, that's enough.

178
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,920
Stop it already.

179
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,420
Stop it Tanaka.

180
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:50,420
Tanaka, stop it already.

181
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:53,920
I think I can see more of Hanzo Akanuki.

182
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:54,920
Yes, you can.

183
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:55,920
Fujimo!

184
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:56,920
Fujimo.

Go, go, go!

That momentum.

217
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:38,580

218
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:44,580

00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:33,580
Hamaguma!

237
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:41,580
It wasn't a complete correct answer.

238
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:44,580

244
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:04,580

283
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:15,580
That's a long throw!

00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:17,580
That's a long throw!

285
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:21,580
He's not using his hand!

286
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:33,580
The next problem is...

287
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:35,580
I'm going to die!

288
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:37,580
Die?

289
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:40,580
The highest mountain in Japan is?

290
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:45,580
Are you ready?

291
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:47,580
The highest mountain is?

292
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:49,580
Please answer until the hammer can.

293
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:51,580
Depending on the answer, it will be...

294
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:53,580
Ah, then, Hosei Zagoshi.

Wait, wait, wait.

299
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:02,580
I'm sure it's...

300
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:05,580
The highest mountain is?

301
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:07,580
I'm not a human being.

302
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:11,580
If you get out of the position...

303
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:15,580
Hurry up!

304
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:17,580

What is the secret technique of Dragon Ball's Son Goku?

313

315
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:42,580

No hammer, no hammer.

325
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:06,580
Still hammering?

326
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:07,580
No hammer.

327
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:10,580
Ha ha ha ha ha!

328
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:12,580

00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:14,580
Rock-paper-scissors time.

330
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:16,580
Let's move on to the next game.

331
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:18,580
The Hamba Kamba Game!

332
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:24,580
This is a simple game.

333
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:26,580
It's a Senrami Tsuo game.

334
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:27,580
It's like that.

335
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:28,580

337
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:32,580
The one who supports the opponent is Zako Shisho.

338
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:34,580
And the last one is Hyoudo Nari.

339
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:35,580
I see.

340
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:36,580
Hamba Kamba.

341
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:38,580
There are two people on both sides.

342
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:39,580
Go!

343
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:43,580
If it doesn't work, you'll be in death-anne time.

344

Desanne

345

As long as you allow time

347
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:49,580
Desanne

348
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:50,580
That's too much

349
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:51,580
Desanne

350
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:52,580
This is team play

351
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:53,580
I'll make it a success

352
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:54,580
That's what I mean

353
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:57,580
So, the start is from Tanaka Zokoshi

354
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:58,580

00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:08,580
It's wrong

361
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:09,580

Who was the first one to say that?

00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,800
Return to your seat

375
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,800
