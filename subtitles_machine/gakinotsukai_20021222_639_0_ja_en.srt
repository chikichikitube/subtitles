1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
It's cold and I'm not in a good mood.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Hama-chan, I have something to tell you.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
What is it?

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Even if you ask me why I'm here, there's only one reason.

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
He's angry.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Who?

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Him.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Oshima! Oshima!

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
What are you talking about?

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
You're going to get beaten up again today.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Hey, Hama!

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
What is it?

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Why didn't you come to pick me up?

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
What is she talking about?

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I don't know.

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Oshima is waiting for you.

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
What?

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
What are you waiting for?

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
What do you mean he's not coming to pick me up?

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
But he got married recently.

21
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
He got married recently?

22
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Congratulations.

23
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
That's why I'm wearing a wedding dress.

24
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I see.

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
That's not true!

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
My voice echoed.

27
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
It echoed.

28
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
What are you talking about?

29
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I don't know.

30
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I don't understand what you're saying.

31
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Hama-chan is going to be like this because you're being so noisy.

32
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
What do you mean?

33
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
You sound like you're going to throw it away.

34
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
So...

35
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
What do you mean by being so noisy?

36
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I don't know.

37
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Come and get me.

38
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
No, no.

39
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
But...

40
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
But Hamada-san is already married.

41
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Yes, you're already married.

42
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Love and marriage are two different things!

43
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
A married woman shouldn't fall in love?

44
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
What are you talking about?

45
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Murakami!

46
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
What are you talking about?

47
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Who are you trying to play?

48
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Why don't you call your teacher?

49
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Oshima Miyuki in Morisan.

50
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Since last year's Valentine's Day,

51
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
she has been attacking Hamada with her love for him.

52
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
But she was rejected and she cried.

53
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
This fall, she was happily married to the love of her life.

54
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
But she didn't get tired of it and appeared again.

55
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Will she be able to steal Hamada's heart?

56
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Tonight, just before Christmas,

57
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
we will show you the ultimate plan.

58
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
This program is brought to you by these sponsors.

59
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I've told you many times that you're not Hamada's type.

60
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
You've been trying to make me like that.

61
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Hamada likes women who smell dangerous.

62
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
What kind of scent is this? I don't know.

63
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
For example, the scent of a bomb in her underwear.

64
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I don't know anything about that.

65
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
He only looks at women like that.

66
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
His wife is the only one who has ever done that.

67
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
That's why he married her.

68
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
A bomb is a good thing.

69
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
What's wrong?

70
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Oh no!

71
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Oh no!

72
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
It's a bomb!

73
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
It's on my clothes again!

74
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Do it!

75
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
You're going to blow it up, right?

76
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
It's true. It's a bomb.

77
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Don't do it. It's dangerous.

78
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
It's dangerous.

79
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
It's okay.

80
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Do it with a straight face.

81
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
What should I do?

82
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
You shouldn't do that.

83
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
It's dangerous.

84
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Hamada likes women like that.

85
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
You shouldn't do that.

86
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
You can't escape even if you're dirty.

87
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
What should I do?

88
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Hamada likes women like that.

89
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
What's going on?

90
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
What are you doing?

91
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
It's a big bomb.

92
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Go away!

93
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
It stinks!

94
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Don't come here in the middle of the night!

95
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Take it away!

96
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Hey!

97
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
You shouldn't do that.

98
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
It stinks!

99
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
You're still burning.

100
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
It stinks!

101
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Take him away.

102
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Let's go home.

103
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
It stinks!

104
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
You shouldn't come here in the middle of the night.

105
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Let's go home.

106
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
You did what I told you to do.

107
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
What's wrong with you?

108
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Let's go home.

109
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Let's go home.

110
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
You shouldn't come here in the middle of the night.

111
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Let's go home.

112
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I've heard this before.

113
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
He likes women who are black and white.

114
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
That's true.

115
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,000
He likes women who are black and white.

116
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I've heard that.

117
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
He likes women who are black and white.

118
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
He likes women who are black and white.

119
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
He likes women who are black and white.

120
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
He likes women who are black and white.

121
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
He likes women who are black and white.

122
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
It's impossible for him to do that.

123
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Let's go home.

124
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
It's impossible.

125
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I've never done that before.

126
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Let's go home.

127
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
It's impossible.

128
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
What's wrong?

129
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Come on.

130
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Hey.

131
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
It's so bad.

132
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Shut up.

133
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
It's so bad.

134
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I can't finish it.

135
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
You can do it.

136
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
It's a human pump.

137
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
There are both white and black, so you can drink one at a time.

138
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
19 points.

139
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Let's do it.

140
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
19 points for the blue one.

141
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Don't be silly.

142
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Don't do that.

143
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Don't do that.

144
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Really?

145
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Did you drink it?

146
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Yes, I did.

147
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Don't be silly.

148
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Let's make it clear.

149
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Really?

150
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Are you okay with this?

151
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
This is cool.

152
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Can you do it?

153
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Which one is white and black?

154
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Which one is white and black?

155
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
White.

156
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Can you do it?

157
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
You can do it.

158
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
You can do it.

159
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Can you do it?

160
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Can you do it?

161
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Stop it.

162
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
That's not how you do it.

163
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Can you do it?

164
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Stop it.

165
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
You're a demon.

166
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Go home.

167
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
That's not how you do it.

168
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
That's not how you do it.

169
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
You can't do it.

170
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I can't do it.

171
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I've never done it.

172
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
What should I do?

173
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
It's dirty.

174
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
It's a shame.

175
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:18,000
You can sing My Way with your heart.

176
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:26,000
You can sing My Way with your heart.

177
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
That's how you do it.

178
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
That's how you do it.

179
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
It's impossible.

180
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Let's go home.

181
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Let's go.

182
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
It's 19 o'clock.

183
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
That's it.

184
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I can do this.

185
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Let's do it.

186
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I got it.

187
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I'll be right back.

188
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I'll be right back.

189
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I'll be right back.

190
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Where are you going?

191
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Where are you going?

192
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Are you going to sing?

193
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
It's okay.

194
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Music, please.

195
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I'll talk to you when I'm done.

196
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I'll talk to you when I'm done.

197
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I'll talk to you when I'm done.

198
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I'm not young and easy

199
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:21,000
So I face the final curtain

200
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I only did what I thought

201
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I took my wish and I made

202
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I know much more than me

203
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I didn't mind my way

204
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,000
But still, I can't stop

205
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I only have a dream to find

206
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I see all of it

207
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
And that's the truth

208
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:10,000
And it goes my way

209
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
You know, I have to go

210
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I have to shoot a commercial for Georgia

211
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I know

212
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I don't have time so I have to go

213
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Thank you

214
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
See you

215
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
See you

216
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Hey, hey

217
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
That's not what I'm talking about

218
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
You're not looking back at all

219
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
What are we going to do?

220
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Hama-chan left

221
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
We have to go to Oshima

222
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
If we go now, we can catch up with her

223
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
That's true

224
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Hama-san, we have work to do

225
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Stop it, Mori-san

226
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Even if we catch up with her

227
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
There's no half-hearted acting

228
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Hey

229
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Stop it, Mori-san

230
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Mori-san

231
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Stop it

232
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
It hurts

233
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
You can't do that

234
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
What should we do?

235
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Should we go?

236
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
We have to go

237
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
We have to go

238
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Is there anything?

239
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
No

240
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
There's nothing

241
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
There's nothing

242
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
You're the type, right?

243
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
You know

244
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I'm not exactly the type

245
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I'm more of a race queen

246
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
You're not exactly the type

247
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I'm not exactly the type

248
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I'm not exactly the type

249
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Everyone likes it

250
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I'm not exactly the type

251
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
You're not exactly the type

252
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Hama-chan, really?

253
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Yes

254
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Hey, Oshima

255
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Let's trust Hama-chan

256
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Let's do that

257
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Even if you say race queen

258
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
There's nothing we can do

259
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
It's a leotard

260
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
It's a leotard, so it's not a problem

261
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
It's a matter of morality

262
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
It's a matter of morality

263
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
It's a matter of morality

264
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Really

265
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
What's wrong?

266
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
What's wrong?

267
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Hey, Oshima

268
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
It's loud

269
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
It's a race queen

270
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
It's loud

271
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
It's loud

272
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
What's wrong?

273
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Let's take it off together

274
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Let's do that

275
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Let's take it off together

276
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Let's do that

277
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I think it's going to be fine

278
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Hey

279
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Hey

280
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Come here

281
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
It's cold

282
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
It's cold

283
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Start

284
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I always see you at the usual station

285
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,000
You're wearing a sailor uniform

286
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
It's time to send you off

287
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
It's time to send you off

288
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I'm waiting for you today

289
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Oshima

290
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
This is tough

291
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
There's tomorrow

292
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
There's tomorrow

293
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
There's tomorrow

294
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
There's tomorrow

295
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
There's tomorrow

296
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
There's tomorrow

297
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
There's tomorrow

298
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
What are you doing?

299
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Here

300
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
What?

301
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Here

302
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
What's here?

303
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Here

304
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Go away

305
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I'm working

306
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Go away

307
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Go away

308
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I'm working

309
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Go away

310
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I'm working

311
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
It hurts

312
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
It hurts

313
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I'm working

314
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
It hurts

315
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
What are you doing?

316
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Why?

317
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
What's wrong?

318
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
What's wrong?

319
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
You can't breathe

320
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I'm doing a commercial

321
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
What's wrong?

322
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
What are you doing?

323
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Han-san, I'm sorry, I didn't mean it like that.

324
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Wow, that's amazing!

325
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Hey!

326
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
You're a bit too much.

327
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Why do you always react like that?

328
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Go home, you guys!

329
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Okay.

330
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Then I'll get back to work.

331
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Sorry.

332
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Apologize!

333
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
You like me, don't you?

334
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
That's it!

335
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Go home!

336
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
What do you mean?

337
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
No, I really like Race Queen.

338
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
That's not what I'm saying!

339
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I'm saying that you're not Race Queen.

340
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
What's wrong with you, Hara?

341
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
You're not even close to Anko.

342
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Seriously.

343
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Give me a break.

344
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
What are you going to do?

345
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
What are you going to do?

346
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
What are you going to do?

347
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Go home and sleep.

348
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Just one night.

349
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I'm going to sleep.

350
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I'm going to sleep.

351
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I'm going to sleep.

352
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Oh?

353
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I'm going to sleep.

354
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Hey!

355
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
What are you going to do?

356
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
What are you going to do?

357
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Go home!

358
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
What should I do?

359
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I'll go home.

360
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
You can't go home!

361
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
You're going to get scolded.

362
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I have to go.

363
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
You're going to get scolded again.

364
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Seriously.

365
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Let's stop.

366
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Let's go home.

367
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
There he is.

368
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
He's here.

369
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I'm going to sleep.

370
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
What are you going to do next?

371
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
What are we going to do next?

372
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
What's next?

373
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
This world.

374
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
You just got scolded.

375
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
You just have to succeed next time.

376
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
That's right.

377
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Why did you come all the way here?

378
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
What should I do?

379
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Why are you trying so hard?

380
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Let's hurry up.

381
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Let's hurry up.

382
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Let's go next.

383
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
You're like a child of a dinosaur.

384
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
There's something, right?

385
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
There's this much.

386
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Hurry up.

387
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I don't know.

388
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
What I heard was...

389
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I heard that there are women who like Hollywood.

390
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:19,000
For example, this year, the ring was made in Sagako.

391
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
That's not the story.

392
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
That's not the story.

393
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
What should I do?

394
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Let's use this.

395
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
This can be used as a dress.

396
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
That's true.

397
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
That's great.

398
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
What are you guys doing?

399
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
What are you guys doing?

400
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Let's stop.

401
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
It's really bad.

402
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
It's okay.

403
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Start.

404
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I'm Hamada, the head of the family.

405
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Nice to meet you.

406
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I'm Hamada.

407
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Nice to meet you.

408
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Nice to meet you.

409
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Nice to meet you.

410
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
What is it?

411
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I don't know.

412
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Stop it.

413
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
It's bad.

414
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
It's bad.

415
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
It's bad.

416
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Stop it.

417
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I'm Hamada.

418
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I'm Hamada.

419
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
It's over.

420
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Hurry up.

421
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
What are you doing?

422
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Hurry up.

423
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
What are you doing?

424
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
What are you doing?

425
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Aren't you Sadako?

426
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Aren't you Sadako?

427
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I don't know.

428
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Don't come.

429
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I'm Hamada.

430
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I'm Hamada.

431
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Don't come.

432
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Don't come.

433
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
It hurts.

434
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
It hurts.

435
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I'm sorry.

436
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I'm sorry.

437
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Let's go home.

438
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Let's go.

439
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I told you during the show.

440
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I was going to hit you.

441
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Don't be silly.

442
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
That's not what I said.

443
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
That's not what I said.

444
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Why are you wearing a black underwear?

445
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
It's underwear.

446
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I don't understand.

447
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
That's not Sadako.

448
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
That's not Sadako.

449
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
You're wearing a black underwear.

450
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
We're going home.

451
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
It's over.

452
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I'm going home.

453
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Let's go.

454
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Let's go home.

455
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Let's go home.

456
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Don't come.

457
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Stop it.

458
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Stop it.

459
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Listen to me.

460
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
It hurts.

461
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
It hurts.

462
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
It hurts.

463
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
How many times do I have to tell you?

464
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
It's not a few times.

465
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
It's a lot.

466
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
It's a lot.

467
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I'm not angry because I want to be angry.

468
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
You'll do something, won't you?

469
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
If you ask me, it's Kanda.

470
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
That's right.

471
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
It's Kanda.

472
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Hamada likes a fresh woman.

473
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
What should I do?

474
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
It's too much.

475
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Let's go home.

476
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
What should I do?

477
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
What should I do?

478
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Let's go home.

479
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Let's go home.

480
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
What's going on?

481
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
What's going on?

482
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
What's going on?

483
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
What's that?

484
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
What's that?

485
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
It's a sea bream.

486
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
It's alive.

487
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Oshima.

488
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I can't say a word in that situation.

489
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Say something.

490
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Oshima, it's a sea bream.

491
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
It's a sea bream.

492
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
It's scary.

493
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
It's nice.

494
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Let's go home.

495
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
What's going on?

496
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Let's go home.

497
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Let's go home.

498
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Let's go home.

499
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Kuro-san, you should talk.

500
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Talk.

501
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
How many times have we done this?

502
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
It's the real thing.

503
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
It's the real thing.

504
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
It's starting.

505
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Start.

506
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Please look forward to it.

507
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Today, I'll do it for you.

508
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Please.

509
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Let's drink.

510
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Nakai-san.

511
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Yes.

512
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Please.

513
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
What are you doing?

514
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
What are you doing?

515
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Eat it.

516
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
It's fresh.

517
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Eat it.

518
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Hurry up.

519
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Oshima.

520
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Oshima, come here.

521
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Say sorry.

522
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
It's a different story.

523
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
It's not a different story.

524
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
What should I do?

525
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
I'm asking you.

526
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Say sorry.

527
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I didn't do anything wrong.

528
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I said I like fresh food.

529
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
It's not fresh at all.

530
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I can't eat it.

531
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I'll drink it.

532
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I'll drink it.

533
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
It's dangerous.

534
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
What are you doing?

535
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Don't get in my way.

536
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Let's go home.

537
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
It's not over yet.

538
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
It's not over yet.

539
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I'll go for a while.

540
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Why?

541
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
It's okay.

542
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I'll go for a while.

543
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
I have to go.

544
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
How are you going to go?

545
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
It's here.

546
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Where is it?

547
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
It's here.

548
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
It's here.

549
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
It's here.

550
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
It's dangerous.

551
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
It's dangerous.

552
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Don't say things that you don't like.

553
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
You've been saying it for a while.

554
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
What are you doing?

555
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
It's true.

556
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
You've been saying it for a while.

557
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
You're not getting any of the answers right.

558
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
What are you going to do?

559
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I'm saying it because the method is different.

560
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
What's different?

561
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I was going to say this.

562
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Yes.

563
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Why?

564
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,000
To be honest, Hamada is a class S.

565
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
He's a pervert.

566
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Yes.

567
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,000
You have to be a woman who fits that.

568
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
You have to be class M.

569
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Even if I say class M, I'm not that class M.

570
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
It might be true.

571
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
No.

572
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Do something.

573
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Do something.

574
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
How many years have you been doing this?

575
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:42,000
It would be nice if you could feel Hamada's class S.

576
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I can't.

577
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
What are you going to do?

578
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
It's a class S, so I can't do it.

579
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
I can't do it.

580
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
You can't do it.

581
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
No.

582
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
What's wrong?

583
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Look at this.

584
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
I'm going to be a woman who fits that.

585
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
You can do it.

586
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I'm going to be a woman who fits that.

587
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I can be a class M.

588
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
You have to do it.

589
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
You're going to be a woman who fits that.

590
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Let's go.

591
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Wait a minute.

592
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I'm hungry.

593
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I'm shaking a little.

594
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
That's nice.

595
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Let's start.

596
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Okay.

597
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Start.

598
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
I'm going to be a woman who fits that.

599
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
You have to do it.

600
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Do it.

601
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Do it.

602
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Do it.

603
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Do it.

604
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Do it.

605
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Do it.

606
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I'm going to be a woman who fits that.

607
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I'm scared.

608
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:02,000
This is scary.

609
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
This is hell.

610
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
This is hell.

611
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:22,000
This is hell.

612
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Are you wearing glasses?

613
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:31,000
I'm wearing glasses.

614
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:36,000
You're really scary.

615
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
This is much too much.

616
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:45,000
It's too much.

617
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
It's like you're doing everything.

618
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
It's really like you're doing everything.

619
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
It's like you don't understand the depth of the earth.

620
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,000
You don't understand.

621
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,000
I'm wearing glasses.

622
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
You are the worst.

623
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
You scared me.

624
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
No, no.

625
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
I don't know what to do.

626
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Hey, hey, hey.

627
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Stop it.

628
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Murakami.

629
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
I'm going to push.

630
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Go away.

631
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
You are a loser.

632
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
I'm going to push.

633
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
I'm going to push.

634
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Go away.

635
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I'm going to push.

636
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Go away.

637
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
What?

638
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Go away.

639
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Shut up.

640
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
No, no.

641
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
I'm going to push.

642
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Go away.

643
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Shut up.

644
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
I'm going to push.

645
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Shut up.

646
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Shut up.

647
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Shut up.

648
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
You are a loser.

649
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Who is the father?

650
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
I don't know.

651
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
I don't get it.

652
00:23:47,000 --> 00:24:16,000
