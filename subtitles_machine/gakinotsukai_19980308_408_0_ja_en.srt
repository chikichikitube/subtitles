1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
It's the same as usual, the dressing room in downtown.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
What's that weird atmosphere?

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
What?

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
It's not weird at all.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Is that so?

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
It's normal.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
It's a good atmosphere as usual.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
It's calm.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
It's better to go around.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
That's right.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I have a talk with Mr. Omao.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Where's Yamazaki?

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I haven't seen him yet.

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I haven't seen him either.

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I haven't seen Yamazaki either.

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
That's right.

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Excuse me.

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Excuse me.

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Mr. Yamazaki is locked up in the bathroom.

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
He can't come out.

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
What do you mean?

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Is he locked up?

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I think he's locked up by himself.

24
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
He can't come out.

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
It's his will, isn't it?

26
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I think so.

27
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I can't come out at all.

28
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Excuse me.

29
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I want you to come out.

30
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Yes, please.

31
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Excuse me.

32
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Please come out with me.

33
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Why do you keep saying that?

34
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:28,000
This program is provided by the sponsor you are watching.

35
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
It can't be helped.

36
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Yamazaki goes to the bathroom.

37
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Yamazaki.

38
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Mr. Omao.

39
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Where are you?

40
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Mr. Omao.

41
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
What are you doing?

42
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
What are you doing?

43
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
What are you doing?

44
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
What are you doing?

45
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Do you know why I'm in this place?

46
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
He can't say it.

47
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
What are you doing?

48
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
There's a lot of pain.

49
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
It's a real show.

50
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
It's better to come out.

51
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Please come out.

52
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Are you coming out?

53
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
No, I'm going home.

54
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Wait a minute.

55
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
There's a lot of pain.

56
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
He can't say it.

57
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
These days.

58
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I don't want to be in the opening.

59
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I see.

60
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
What do you mean?

61
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
It's natural.

62
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
It's not natural.

63
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I've been doing it since the second time.

64
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
That's all.

65
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I've been on TV since I was 24.

66
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
This TV?

67
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I've been on TV since I was 24.

68
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I've been doing my best in the first round.

69
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Do you know how hard it is to do your best in the first round?

70
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
You know that best.

71
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Don't say that.

72
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I don't say that.

73
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Wait a minute.

74
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Wait a minute.

75
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Do you love me?

76
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Even if you say you love me.

77
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I have nothing to say to you.

78
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Wait a minute.

79
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
What is it?

80
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Uncle.

81
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
No.

82
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Uncle.

83
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I'm Tadaka.

84
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I like you.

85
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
The show is about to start.

86
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I'm in trouble.

87
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Please come out.

88
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I'm in trouble.

89
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
What kind of welcome is this?

90
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I'm in trouble.

91
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I'm in trouble.

92
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I'm in trouble.

93
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I'm in trouble.

94
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Please come out.

95
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I'm sorry, Tadaka.

96
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
You're always a support to my heart.

97
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Mr. Yamaguchi.

98
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I'm a fool.

99
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I'm Endo.

100
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Endo is a fool.

101
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I hate Endo the most.

102
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I hate Endo the most.

103
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I hate Endo the most.

104
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I hate Endo the most.

105
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I hate Endo the most.

106
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
It's a shame that you're out.

107
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
He stepped on to the Marshal.

108
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Mr. Yamaguchi.

109
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Please come out.

110
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Take your time and get out of here.

111
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
It's hard to get out of here.

112
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
You have your own house ready, right?

113
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Of course.

114
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I won't be embarrassed if you come out.

115
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I know that.

116
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I won't complain then.

117
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I can't do it. If it's funny, I'll do it.

118
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Of course I'll do it.

119
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Of course.

120
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Let's do it.

121
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Let's do it.

122
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Okay.

123
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
What are you doing?

124
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
What are you doing?

125
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
You're a coward.

126
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I'm a coward.

127
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Do you understand?

128
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Do your best.

129
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
You've been talking to me like that.

130
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Thank you for your support.

131
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Thank you very much.

132
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I don't think the winner is happy with this.

133
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I think so, too.

134
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I pulled it.

135
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I really pulled it.

136
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I can't say it's not funny.

137
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I can't say it's not funny.

138
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I understand.

139
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I don't understand.

140
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I don't understand.

141
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I don't understand.

142
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I don't understand.

143
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
What are you doing?

144
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
You think I'm going to slip, right?

145
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Who moved?

146
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I'm sorry.

147
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
You think I'm going to slip, right?

148
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
You think I'm going to slip, right?

149
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
You're a kid.

150
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
You're a kid.

151
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
You're a kid.

152
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
You're a kid.

153
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
You're a kid.

154
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Let's go.

155
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Let's go.

156
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Let's go.

157
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I'm here to call you.

158
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I'm here to call you.

159
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I'm here to call you.

160
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I'm here to call you.

161
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I'm here to call you.

162
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Are you filming me?

163
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Are you filming me?

164
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
You're still doing it?

165
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I was pretty confident.

166
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I didn't think they'd do it.

167
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I didn't think they'd do it.

168
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I was pretty confident.

169
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I didn't think it'd take that long.

170
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I didn't think it'd take that long.

171
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I wonder if Tanaka will be able to do it.

172
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Don't worry about it.

173
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Wait a minute.

174
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
If Tanaka is able to do it...

175
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Are you going to hit your shoulder?

176
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Let's go.

177
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
What is it?

178
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
What is it?

179
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Isn't this amazing?

180
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Really?

181
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
It's really, really funny.

182
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I don't think you should be so proud of yourself.

183
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
No, I shouldn't be.

184
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
What?

185
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
What is that?

186
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Don't you think it's weird?

187
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I don't think it's weird.

188
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
That's right.

189
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
It's amazing.

190
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Are you really confident?

191
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I'm really confident.

192
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Okay, let's go.

193
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Let's stop.

194
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Let's stop.

195
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I can't show such an interesting thing on TV.

196
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
It's a loss for us, too.

197
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
It's a loss for us, too.

198
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
This result is the second half of the program.

199
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
There are a lot of young people right now.

200
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Yes, yes.

201
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I'm going to get rid of them all at once.

202
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I found something that I could get rid of at once.

203
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Are you really confident?

204
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I'm really confident.

205
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Yamasaki is like that, and so is Aikata.

206
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
You're the only one who's like that, right?

207
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
That's right.

208
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I feel like I'm tightening myself more and more.

209
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Then I'll do it like that.

210
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Really?

211
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
That's amazing.

212
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Then let's see.

213
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Let's see.

214
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Then let's go.

215
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I went to a different place.

216
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I think I drew the back of the back of the back of the back of the back of the back of the back.

217
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I think it's like this.

218
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
That's right.

219
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Oh, I'll do it again.

220
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I'll shoot it.

221
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Well, I'll apologize.

222
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I'm sorry.

223
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
We'll do our best from the beginning.

224
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
We were a little too sweet.

225
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I've been raised to be a great guy.

226
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Let's just do it together.

227
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Yeah.

228
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Go back to the beginning.

229
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
But.

230
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Tanaka is sweating a lot right now.
