1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
High Tension is the Best!

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
High Tension is the Best!

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Good evening!

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Good evening!

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
It's been a while!

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
It's been about a year and a half.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Yes, that's right.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Yesterday, I was with Miyasako-san and Endo-san.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
But your tension was low.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Why is my tension low when I'm doing this?

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
That's why I brought you here on the same day.

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Let's announce the rankings!

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Yes!

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
First, the 10th place this week is...

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
112 points!

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000

00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Congratulations!

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Tanaka-san always comes in 10th place.

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
He's always in the top 10.

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Don't you think your tension will go up?

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
That's right!

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
If it's fun here, you'll say,

24
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I don't care about this!

25
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
That's right! I want to do it here!

26
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
What are you talking about?

27
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Then, please stand by.

28
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Then, the 10th place this week,

29
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Kogoriko Tanaka Naoki,

30
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Gekirin 82002!

31
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Kogoriko Tanaka Naoki

32
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Idiot!

33
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Idiot!

34
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Idiot!

35
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Idiot!

36
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Idiot!

37
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Thank you very much!

38
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Let's move on.

39
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
The 9th place this week is...

40
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
135 points!

41
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Musical Cats!

42
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
The 9th place this week is...

43
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Congratulations!

44
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Arun-san, are you in the 9th place?

45
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Yes, I am.

46
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
What's your best so far?

47
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I think I'm in the top 9.

48
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
9th is the easiest to do.

49
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I see.

50
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I can't say that the atmosphere is good right now.

51
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
That's right.

52
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I didn't want to come out.

53
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I heard that this time is scary.

54
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I'm scared.

55
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
It's like a small tool peeking from the back is scary.

56
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
That's right.

57
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
That's right.

58
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
We've been found out.

59
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Then, please stand by.

60
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Thank you very much!

61
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I wonder what it's going to be like.

62
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I'm nervous.

63
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Let's go.

64
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Then, the 9th place this week is...

65
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Osarude Musical Cats!

66
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Musical Cats!

67
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I'm small!

68
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I'm dead!

69
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I'm dead!

70
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Let someone come back to life!

71
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Doctor!

72
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Doctor!

73
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Doctor!

74
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Nappa-chan!

75
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Change the sand!

76
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Change the sand!

77
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
When you're done,

78
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Please open the gap!

79
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Please give me a daughter!

80
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Thank you very much!

81
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Thank you very much!

82
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Thank you very much!

83
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Thank you very much!

84
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Thank you very much!

85
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I always think about this.

86
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
The people who finished are sitting next to each other.

87
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
They never leave.

88
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
The 8th place this week is...

89
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
158.X Showtime!

90
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000

00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Please come over here!

92
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Thank you very much!

93
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
It's Mimata-san!

94
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Yes!

95
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Mimata-san!

96
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Yes!

97
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
There's a phone call from someone.

98
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Please take a look.

99
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Who is it?

100
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Hello?

101
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Hello?

102
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Who is it?

103
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
It's Chao-san.

104
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Who is it?

105
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I'm sorry.

106
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,000
She's my girlfriend. We've been dating for 8 years.

107
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
What is it?

108
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
What's her name?

109
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Her name is Hisako.

110
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Hisako-san!

111
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Hisako-san!

112
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Nice to meet you.

113
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Nice to meet you.

114
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Nice to meet you.

115
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
It's always a pleasure to meet you.

116
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Have you ever had a fight?

117
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
A fight is...

118
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
When I'm stressed out,

119
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I want to complain.

120
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I want to complain, but...

121
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Yes, yes, yes.

122
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I want to show my manliness.

123
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I want to push him down.

124
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I want to take off his underwear.

125
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I want to hold him down.

126
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I want to stretch his stomach.

127
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I want to push him down his mouth and nose.

128
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
And then...

129
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I want to say,

130
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I want to say,

131
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I want to say,

132
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I want to say,

133
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
It has nothing to do with me.

134
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
What are you talking about?

135
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
What are you talking about?

136
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Hey, this is a TV show.

137
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Standby, please.

138
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
This week's 8th episode of Jodan's

139
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
It's Showtime!

140
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000

141
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I want to get a job this year!

142
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Ladies and gentlemen,

143
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000

144
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000

145
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
One, two, three, four.

146
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Right hand, showtime.

147
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Left hand, showtime.

148
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Yes.

149
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Yes, Tsutajo Imaichi, showtime.

150
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Pan, pan, pan.

151
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I want to make you laugh.

152
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I don't want to be laughed at.

153
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I want to make you laugh.

154
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
There was an era like this, too.

155
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Showtime!

156
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Thank you very much.

157
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000

164
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Ueshiba-san.

165
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
You made a great impact today.

166
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Thank you very much.

167
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I can't look at you directly.

168
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Thank you very much.

169
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I'm shaking and my heart is pounding.

170
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Well, then...

171
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Are you ready for standby?

172
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Yes, please.

173
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I understand.

174
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Well, it's wonderful.

175
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Oh, standby is ready.

176
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
This week's guest is...

177
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000

00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Ueshiba!

179
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I fell in love at first sight.

180
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I'm cute.

181
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Ebisu-kun!

182
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Let's go!

183
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Ebisu-kun concert!

184
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Music start!

185
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Encore!

186
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Encore!

187
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Encore!

188
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Thank you very much!

189
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
That's all!

190
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
That was Ebisu-kun.

191
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
You are the best.

192
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Thank you very much.

193
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Thank you very much.

194
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Thank you very much.

195
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:51,000
There wasn't much inside.

196
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,000
This week's 6th place is...

197
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
271 points Aito Seishun no Megafight!

198
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Amewarikess vs. Miyasako Hiroyuki!

199
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Yeah!

200
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Well, I have a bad sense of humor.

201
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
It's been a while.

202
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I think I smell a bit of alcohol.

203
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
It's okay.

204
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
It's okay?

205
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
It's because you drank a lot in the morning.

206
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
That's why you're so excited.

207
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
It's from yesterday.

208
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
It's okay.

209
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I don't drink alcohol at all.

210
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Really? Does it smell?

211
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
It's a bit...

212
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Why do you want to drink?

213
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
You drink, don't you?

214
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I've been drinking since debut.

215
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I'll do my best!

216
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Yes!

217
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Thank you very much!

218
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
This week's 6th place is...

219
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Amewarikess vs. Miyasako Hiroyuki!

220
00:09:45,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Aito Seishun no Megafight!

221
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
It's cold!

222
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I got something on me.

223
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I can't take it off.

224
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I can't take it off.

225
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Let's go!

226
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Glasses, go!

227
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Glasses, go!

228
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Glasses, elbow!

229
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Glasses!

230
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Glasses!

231
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Glasses!

232
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Eat sushi!

233
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Eat sushi!

234
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
It's cold!

235
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Thank you very much!

236
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Why are you between Osaru and Tanaka?

237
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
This week's 5th place is...

238
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
290 points!

239
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Who is it?

240
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
2002 version!

241
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Fukawa Ryo!

242
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Congratulations!

243
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Fukawa-san!

244
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Fukawa-san, 5th place?

245
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Yes, thank you very much.

246
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I think I can do well this time.

247
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Thank you very much.

248
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Let's go!

249
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
This week's 5th place is...

250
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Fukawa Ryo!

251
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Who is it?

252
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:24,000
2002 version!

253
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Who is it?

254
00:11:43,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I can't take it off.

255
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
What should I do?

256
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
What should I do with this?

257
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I'll do it for Fukawa.

258
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I lifted it.

259
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
It's still there.

260
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Dad!

261
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Thank you very much!

262
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Thank you very much.

263
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
This way!

264
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Are you going home?

265
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,000
My bicycle fell down.

266
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I lifted it with an ad-lib.

267
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I don't want to get hurt.

268
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
It's like this.

269
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I feel like I can't see the floor.

270
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Next week's 4th place is...

271
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
364 points!

272
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Don't be fooled!

273
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Kokoriko!

274
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Endo Shouzo!

275
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Congratulations!

276
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I think Endo-san's appearance is a little fast.

277
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
There are a lot of people today, right?

278
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:10,000
This time, I'll do it in an electric way.

279
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
You're doing it yourself.

280
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I was surprised the other day.

281
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
There's a volleyball team called Yakult Salos.

282
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
There's a player called Laviles.

283
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I saw it.

284
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
He was doing it.

285
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
He was doing it after the home run.

286
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Did you go that far?

287
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
He was doing it.

288
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I thought I'd do something new.

289
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I see.

290
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Let's do our best.

291
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Thank you very much.

292
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
It's amazing from the beginning.

293
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Next week's 4th place is...

294
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Kokoriko! Endo Shouzo!

295
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Don't be fooled!

296
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
What is it?

297
00:13:51,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I'll say it to the teenagers these days.

298
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I'll say it to the 20s these days.

299
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I'll say it to the 20s these days.

300
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I'll say it to the 20s these days.

301
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Thank you very much.

302
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,000
The staff members who clean up the set are beautiful.

303
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Did you think too much?

304
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I was looking down.

305
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I gave up the game.

306
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Next week's spotlights!

307
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
This week's spotlights are...

308
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Kendo Kobayashi!

309
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:22,000
He brought a treasure that Kendo cherishes.

310
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
What is it?

311
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
When I was on a school trip,

312
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I almost fell down with a bus guide.

313
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I see.

314
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
But he's an adult.

315
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I thought it was me,

316
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
so I gave up and took good care of it.

317
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Do you still have it?

318
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
What is it?

319
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000
It's a marimo.

320
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I'm nervous and my hands are shaking.

321
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Why are you all so nervous?

322
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
It's okay.

323
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Number three, please.

324
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
It's wonderful.

325
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Number 36 this week.

326
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Kendo Kobayashi's Hedatari.

327
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Let's get started.

328
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Are you going to sit down?

329
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Get your head off me.

330
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
You know that, right?

331
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Feel it.

332
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I don't want to do this.

333
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Feel it!

334
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Love will not exist between us humans and chairs!

335
00:16:51,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Thank you very much!

336
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Thank you very much!

337
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
It's wonderful.

338
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
People who haven't taken a video are frustrated.

339
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I guess so.

340
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
They can't send it quickly.

341
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Number 36 this week.

342
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
456 points.

343
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
How to walk on Earth.

344
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I want to get rid of the rain.

345
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I want to get rid of the rain.

346
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,000
You're stuck in the panel.

347
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
That's right.

348
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:44,000
There is a photo-chan kitchen in Oike.

349
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
What are you doing here?

350
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I'm the manager.

351
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Really?

352
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,000
To put it simply, it's dirty.

353
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Number 3, please.

354
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Number 3 this week.

355
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,000
How to walk on Earth.

356
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I want to get rid of the rain.

357
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I want to get rid of the rain.

358
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I want to get rid of the rain.

359
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:27,000
I want to get rid of the rain.

360
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Thank you very much!

361
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:40,000
You're stuck in the panel.

362
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Number 2 this week.

363
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
485 points.

364
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
How to get rid of the rain.

365
00:18:48,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I want to get rid of the rain.

366
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Congratulations!

367
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Thank you!

368
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Here I go!

369
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
This is the 6th episode, right?

370
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
That's right.

371
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
This is the first time I've been invited.

372
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Did you want to come?

373
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Of course.

374
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
This is the first time I've been invited.

375
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:31,000
This is the first time I've been invited.

376
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:36,000
If you look closely, you can smell the smell of my big forehead.

377
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I was surprised by this.

378
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Mr. Egashira doesn't care about the information.

379
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Everyone is in low spirits.

380
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
This is no good.

381
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,000
This is no good.

382
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Let's do it!

383
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Let's do it!

384
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Let's do it!

385
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Number 2 this week.

386
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:34,000
485 points.

387
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
How to get rid of the rain.

388
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:41,000
I want to get rid of the rain.

389
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
This is the end.

390
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
This is the end.

391
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Thank you very much!

392
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:00,000
I'm not in a good mood.

393
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
He's very excited.

394
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
This is the first place.

395
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
If I say a little more, I'll be disappointed.

396
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
I think it's the first place.

397
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
There's someone above Mr. Egashira Tadai.

398
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
There's someone above him.

399
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Who is it?

400
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Let's find out.

401
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:24,000

You're number one.

407
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:48,000
I didn't think I'd be number one.

408
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
537 points.

409
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Thank you very much.

410
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
When was your child born?

411
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I was born on April 8th.

412
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Which one?

413
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
A girl.

414
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Congratulations.

Momo.

418
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
It's Momo.

419
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Momo-chan.

420
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000

00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
It's written as Momo.

423
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
It's read as Momo.

424
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Let's go.

425
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Stand by, please.

426
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Yes.

427
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Let's go.

428
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
This week's number one, Yamasaki Hosei.

429
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:32,000
The Beyblade King, Yamachan.

430
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,000
La la la la la la la la la la.

431
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:44,000
His face has nothing to do with it.

432
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
I'm really good at the Beyblade.

433
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
I'm going to have a match with Balix.

434
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
It's Balix.

435
00:22:51,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I'm going to have a match with Balix.

436
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
I won't lose.

437
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
I won't lose.

438
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
I won't lose to the Beyblade.

439
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:14,000
I'm waiting.

440
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
I won.

441
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,000
I won.

442
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Oh.

443
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Oh.

444
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:31,000
This is terrible.

445
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Finally, let's take a group photo.

446
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Everyone, face the camera.

447
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Ready, go.

448
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Pose.

449
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Yamaguchi-san, you look sleepy.
