1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I went to eat Cambodian food the other day.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Oh, your country's food?

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I was like...

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I was like, excuse me, can I have yakisoba?

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I was like, excuse me, can I have yakisoba?

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Can you say it?

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
No, I want yakisoba.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
What?!

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I can't hear you!

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Hey, you!

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
What?!

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
It's funny!

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Are you serious?

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Are you serious?

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Are you full?

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
No, I'm not.

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Shut up!

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Are you still full?

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Yeah, I'm full.

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Do you want anything?

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm fine with anything.

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
What do you want?

23
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
What do you want?

24
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Do you want yakisoba?

25
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
It's boring.

26
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Excuse me!

27
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Excuse me, yakisoba!

28
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Get out!

29
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
He said yakisoba.

30
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Where did you come from?

31
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Did I change?

32
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm full.

33
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
What about you?

34
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I almost ate it.

35
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Do you want anything else?

36
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm fine with anything.

37
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Do you want yakisoba?

38
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Excuse me!

39
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Excuse me!

40
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Yakisoba.

41
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:47,000
What?!

42
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Are you serious?

43
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
It's so funny!

44
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I'm full.

45
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Are you serious?

46
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I almost ate it.

47
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
What do you want?

48
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I'm fine with anything.

49
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I'm not full.

50
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Are you serious?

51
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Cambodia.

52
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
The Asian country located on the Indian Peninsula.

53
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
The fertile land where the tropical monsoon spreads,

54
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
and the national nature is still alive.

55
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
The mother river, Mekong,

56
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
flows through a total length of 400 km and makes life beautiful.

57
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
The Angkor Wat statues talk about the nature of the Khmer people.

58
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,000
The Cambodians are very experienced.

59
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
The Cambodians are known for their beauty.

60
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
The Cambodians are very polite.

61
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
The Cambodians are a peaceful nation.

62
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
If you raise your voice,

63
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
they will think that you are making fun of them.

64
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I think that's why the Cambodians were so impudent.

65
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
The journey to Cambodia begins.

66
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
This is the Cambodian restaurant that Mr. Matsumoto told us about.

67
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
The Angkor Wat.

68
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
There is an old lady who is a fan of Cambodian food.

69
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I only do 50% of Cambodian food.

70
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I will show you the real Cambodian food.

71
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Let's go.

72
00:03:51,000 --> 00:04:02,000
This program is brought to you by these sponsors.

73
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Which one?

74
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Bring me some water.

75
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
What did you order?

76
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I didn't order anything.

77
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:39,000
You have a head that looks like a crane.

78
00:04:39,000 --> 00:05:01,000
This is Cambodian food.

79
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:11,000
This is not enough.

80
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,000
How old are you?

81
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
31 years old.

82
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Do you want to eat?

83
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
31 years old.

84
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
You are old enough to eat anything.

85
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
You are in your 20s.

86
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
You are in a club.

87
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:43,000
This is not enough.

88
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Excuse me.

89
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Yakisoba.

90
00:05:49,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Yakisoba.

91
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I'm embarrassed.

92
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:23,000
This is a lie.

93
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:32,000
This is a lie.

94
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Yakisoba is too obvious.

95
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:47,000
You can't say that.

96
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Yakisoba.

97
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Excuse me.

98
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Yakisoba.

99
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:10,000
This is a lie.

100
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
This is a lie.

101
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Yakisoba.

102
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:33,000
This is a lie.

103
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,000
This program is in the evening.

104
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
What time is it?

105
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
It's about 8 o'clock.

106
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
It's 2 o'clock in the morning.

107
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,000
You are still sleeping.

108
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:59,000
You woke up at 9 o'clock.

109
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I woke up at 9 o'clock and ate yakisoba.

110
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I gave you a tie.

111
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
What should I do?

112
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I don't have time today.

113
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I have to go home in 10 minutes.

114
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I don't care about you.

115
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I have to go home in 10 minutes.

116
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
You guys are angry.

117
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Why are you laughing?

118
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
You guys are bad.

119
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I'm not angry.

120
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
You don't have money at all.

121
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I will check your wallet.

122
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:04,000
You don't have money at all.

123
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:11,000
You are crazy when you are in a hurry.

124
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
In a different sense.

125
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,000
How are you doing these days?

126
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:30,000
There is a small newspaper.

127
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I have something to say.

128
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Say it.

129
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Say it.

130
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:47,000
There is a small newspaper.

131
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
What is this?

132
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:59,000
There is a small newspaper.

133
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:06,000
There is a small newspaper.

134
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I have a small newspaper.

135
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
There's a Yu Kanji, isn't there?

136
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Ah, there's a Yu Kanji.

137
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
There's a Yu Kanji, isn't there?

138
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,000
No, there's a Yu Kanji.

139
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I'm going to change my name!

140
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
There's a Yu Kanji.

141
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
There's a Yu Kanji.

142
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Yoroshino.

143
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
What is it?

144
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
There's a Yu Kanji, isn't there?

145
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Ah, there is, there is.

146
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Moe.

147
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
No, no, no.

148
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Ah, there is.

149
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Ah, there is, there is.

150
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Hey, hey.

151
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I was on my face.

152
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Oh, the Yu Kanji.

153
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I was wondering what it was.

154
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I was told I was in debt.

155
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Eh, what's that?

156
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Is that still a scoop?

157
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I don't know what it is.

158
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I don't know.

159
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I was in debt.

160
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I looked it up.

161
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:04,000
It says I have a secret code.

162
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Really? I didn't know that.

163
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
What kind of newspaper is that?

164
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
It's a modern one.

165
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
You're getting worse and worse.

166
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I'm not.

167
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I looked it up one more time.

168
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I was in a bubble.

169
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I was in a bubble.

170
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
The bubble burst and I was in debt.

171
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I had that money.

172
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I borrowed money for two reasons.

173
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I borrowed money because I had a lot of debt.

174
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:38,000
When I asked the people from Yoshimoto, they said it was some kind of mistake.

175
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
That's the reason.

176
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
A certain production manager from Osaka said,

177
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Hamada was putting his hand out on the stock.

178
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Who the hell are you?

179
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
That's the first time I've heard about putting your hand out on the stock.

180
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I'm not putting my hand out!

181
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
That's the first time I've heard about it.

182
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
That's the first time I've heard about it.

183
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I don't really know much about the Kaku Shigo case.

184
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Stop it!

185
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I don't know that much.

186
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I don't know that much.

187
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I was in middle school.

188
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
That's not true!

189
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Why is it so big?

190
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I was in grade 11.

191
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I was in grade 11.

192
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Hideaki-kun.

193
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I was wondering what the idea was.

194
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I was surprised.

195
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I was also writing something.

196
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
A kid's staff, an AD,

197
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
asked me to use something as a kid.

198
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
What was it?

199
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
He said, eat something alive.

200
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
You said that?

201
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I was the one who said it.

202
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
That's right.

203
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Stop it, Suji-kun!

204
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Stop it, Hideaki-kun!

205
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I get it!

206
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
You said you forced an AD to eat something alive.

207
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
You said you forced an AD to eat something alive.

208
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
You said you forced an AD to eat something alive.

209
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
When was that?

210
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Stop it!

211
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Sae-san!

212
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Sae-san!

213
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
You keep on writing things on your own!

214
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
You keep on writing things on your own!

215
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Have you been writing that?

216
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
The other day,

217
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I remember something.

218
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I don't know!

219
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I don't know!

220
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
My phone.

221
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I have a lot of phones.

222
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I have a lot of phones.

223
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I have a lot of phones.

224
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
When I say something,

225
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I get a bomb.

226
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
When I say something,

227
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I get a bomb.

228
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Yesterday,

229
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I said,

230
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Thank you for going to Bombay.

231
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
It was you, right?

232
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
It was worth it.

233
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I will write a new song!

234
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I will write a new song!

235
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I'll say,

236
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Let's play!

237
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Who are you?

238
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I told you to play with me.

239
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I didn't say it, but he always talks about it.

240
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
He's a man, right?

241
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Yes, he's a man.

242
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
He comes to the bar and says,

243
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Hello, Machan! Machan!

244
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Who the hell are you?

245
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Die!

246
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I don't want you to die.

247
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Who are you talking to?

248
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I'm not talking to you.

249
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Who are you talking to?

250
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Who the hell are you?

251
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Who the hell are you?

252
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
What?

253
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Who the hell are you?

254
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
That's not what I meant.

255
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I'm sorry.

256
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I've been a celebrity for years,

257
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
but I've never been called that.

258
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Who the hell are you?

259
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Bye bye.

260
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Stop talking like an old man.

261
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
No matter how you look at it, you're not a woman.

262
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
No matter how you look at it, you're not a woman.

263
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
That's right.

264
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
You're wrong.

265
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
That's not true.

266
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I'm not bad, am I?

267
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
You're bad.

268
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I don't think so.

269
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
It's okay if you're bad.

270
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
But he's big.

271
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
He's big.

272
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:30,000
He's really good at hunting.

273
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
You're laughing.

274
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
You're laughing.

275
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
You're a bad guy.

276
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:40,000
You're playing too much.

277
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Where do you get the secret cheese that you always use?

278
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Secret cheese?

279
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
You don't even turn your tongue?

280
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Compared to when you made your debut,

281
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I'm curious about how close you are to Matsumoto.

282
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I'm a sneak.

283
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Look.

284
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I don't know.

285
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
What's a secret cheese?

286
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
What's that?

287
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
What's a secret cheese?

288
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
It's a secret cheese.

289
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
It's a secret cheese.

290
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
That's something else.

291
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
What's a secret cheese?

292
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:23,000
There's cream inside.

293
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:28,000
If there's cream inside, why are you wearing shoes?

294
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000
You're sweating.

295
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
What?

296
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
What?

297
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
That's not it.

298
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
It doesn't say secret cheese.

299
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
You're sweating.

300
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I'm talking about secret cheese.

301
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
You're talking about secret cheese.

302
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
You're sweating.

303
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I don't know if you're talking about secret cheese.

304
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
It's secret cheese.

305
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
The letter says secret cheese.

306
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,000
You're sweating.

307
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Why are you wearing secret cheese?

308
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I'm not wearing it.

309
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I don't know about those shoes.

310
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I'm not wearing them.

311
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
What's that?

312
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
What's that?

313
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:15,000
What's that?

314
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
These are normal sneakers.

315
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
He's talking about secret cheese.

316
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
But I'm not wearing them.

317
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
But you're talking about secret cheese.

318
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I'm wearing them.

319
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
But I don't know what secret cheese is.

320
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
So please tell me.

321
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Okay, I'll tell you.

322
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Secret cheese means cream inside.

323
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Okay, I'll tell you.

324
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Why are you wearing those shoes?

325
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I'm not wearing them.

326
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Don't say that.

327
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Sorry.

328
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I should have said that earlier.

329
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Secret cheese means cream inside.

330
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I'm wearing them.

331
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
You're wearing shoes.

332
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I'm not wearing them.

333
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
You're not wearing them.

334
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I'm not wearing them.

335
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Okay.

336
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Don't wear them anymore.

337
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I'm not wearing them.

338
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I'm not wearing them.

339
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I'm not wearing them.

340
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I'm not wearing them.

341
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
I got it.

342
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Do you feel better now?

343
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I feel better now.

344
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I'm okay now, right?

345
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Yes.

346
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Thank you.

347
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
You must be kidding me.

348
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I don't know.

349
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Who was the first person you talked to?

350
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,000
And what did you say?

351
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
What did you say when you first talked to me?

352
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I said, I was born in Nagaya.

353
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
What are you talking about?

354
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I said, I was born in Nagaya.

355
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Why are you looking down at me?

356
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:44,000
You should treat him well.

357
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
What did you say when you first talked to me?

358
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I said, I was born in Nagaya.

359
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
That's normal.

360
00:18:52,000 --> 00:19:00,000
When I asked my parents, they said, I was born in Yoshinba.

361
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Did you say something about that?

362
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
I said, I was born in Yoshinba.

363
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
What is Yoshinba?

364
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Even if it was Yoshinba.

365
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
So there was something, right?

366
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Yes, yes, yes.

367
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I'm stupid.

368
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I heard that you were crying in Nagaya.

369
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Yes, yes.

370
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:31,000
When my father told me, if you cry any more, I won't forgive you,

371
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:36,000
the first thing I said was, even if Yoshinba cried.

372
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
That's a long story.

373
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
What did you say?

374
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Who?

375
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
When you first talked to me.

376
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Don't these people start with shouting?

377
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
You can't talk to them for the first time.

378
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Conversation?

379
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
What do you mean?

380
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
I don't know.

381
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:04,000
What do you drink?

382
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Your memory of the circuit is now 1.

383
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Matsumoto-san, you used to be in a group called Sexy.

384
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Are you still active in the Sexy group that Matsumoto-san was in?

385
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
It's a story that hasn't happened yet.

386
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
You were in it properly.

387
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Rather than saying that you were in it, I put you in it.

388
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
What?

389
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Who?

390
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I made a group called Sexy.

391
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Yes, yes, yes.

392
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,000
That's why everyone put me in it.

393
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:46,000
I put you in it.

394
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
So you were the head.

395
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
I was the head.

396
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Where did you run?

397
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,000
I ran a lot.

398
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
You made it with rain, right?

399
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Yes.

400
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Where did you run to?

401
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Well, I ran to Yokohama and Shonan.

402
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
You ran to Yokohama?

403
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
From Hyogo prefecture to Yokohama?

404
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
I said I ran a lot.

405
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
You ran a lot in that sense?

406
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Yes, yes, yes.

407
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
If you went to run once, you wouldn't run for a week, right?

408
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
That's right.

409
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
That's why you rarely...

410
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
That's right.

411
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
You ran once and went to the toilet around there.

412
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
I had a lot of luggage.

413
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Did you stay overnight?

414
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
That's right.

415
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
You prepared to stay overnight to run?

416
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
That's a little trip.

417
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
It's not a little trip, it's a little trip.

418
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
What little trip?

419
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Well, it was really amazing.

420
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
It was cold.

421
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
What?

422
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
I couldn't continue because it was cold.

423
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
What do you mean it was cold?

424
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,000
You want to run whenever you want, right?

425
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
But we're cold.

426
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Because we only wear bras.

427
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:04,000
You know, the long ones with the sleeves.

428
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Sexy uniforms are usually worn with bras.

429
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Because it's cold.

430
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Because of the feet.

431
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,000
It's hard to wear this in the winter.

432
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Basically, I wear it like this.

433
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
I wear heels like this.

434
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,000
That's a scooter.

435
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,000
But it's sexy.

436
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Basically, I wear it like this.

437
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Like this.

438
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
What?

439
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Brandy.

440
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Sometimes I eat chocolate.

441
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
What are you talking about?

442
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:01,000
I eat kiss chocolate.

443
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Your eyes are fixed.

444
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Everyone sees it, right?

445
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
I'm sexy.

446
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,000
I'm sexy.

447
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
There's a drink over there.

448
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
It wasn't popular, was it?

449
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,000
No, no, no.

450
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:30,000
I can only get five people.

451
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
I can't help it.

452
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
There's still one left.

453
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,000
I'm in a hurry.

454
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Don't think it's normal for everyone to come like this.

455
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Yo, Kami!

456
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
What are you doing?

457
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
I'm doing this.

458
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
I'm doing this.

459
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,000
You look like a frog.

460
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
You're a frog.

461
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:08,000
What am I wearing?

462
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
I always wear heels like this.

463
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Thank you.

464
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Thank you.

465
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Goodbye.

466
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:39,000
