1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
What will be the punishment for the one who bites the opening title?

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
What will be the punishment for the one who bites the opening title?

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
The opening title of the first half of the month,

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
What will be the punishment for the one who bites the opening title?

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Coming soon!

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
However, the title call was not as easy as it looks from the outside.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
So, as before, he calls various titles out loud.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
If he bites even a little bit, he will be punished for his fear.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
In the first episode of Gaki no Tsukai Ara,

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
the manager of Down Town,

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Chikichiki Nakibokuro Okamoto...

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Yes!

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
3, 2, 1, go!

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
In the first episode of Gaki no Tsukai Ara,

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Chikichiki...

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Yes!

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Chikichiki...

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Yes!

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
How many times will you say the word Chikichiki?

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
In the first episode of Gaki no Tsukai Ara,

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
we will play a game to decide who bites the opening title!

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Who will be the victim this time?

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
This program is brought to you by these sponsors.

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
This time, it's a double pie throwing game.

25
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Here is the punishment for the one who bites the opening title!

26
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Let's go!

27
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
When I looked at the light,

28
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
the light was so bright that I couldn't see the time.

29
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Let's go!

30
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
3, 2, 1, go!

31
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
In the first episode of Gaki no Tsukai Ara,

32
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
we will play a game to decide who bites the opening title!

33
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Let's go!

34
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Next to Tanaka is...

35
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
3, 2, 1, go!

36
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
In the first episode of Gaki no Tsukai Ara, we will play a game to decide who bites the opening title!

37
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
He's drooling.

38
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
He's drooling.

39
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
He's drooling.

40
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
His hair is in the middle.

41
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Next to Matsumoto is...

42
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Here!

43
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Did you really do that?

44
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
No, I didn't.

45
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
You said it so easily.

46
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I remember most of it.

47
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I didn't do it.

48
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Let's go!

49
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
3, 2, 1, go!

50
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
In the first episode of Gaki no Tsukai Ara,

51
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,000
we will play a game to decide who bites the opening title!

52
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Amazing.

53
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I'm sorry that I didn't get excited.

54
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I'm shaking.

55
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I'm shaking.

56
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
It can't be helped.

57
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Amazing.

58
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Next is...

59
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
It's huge.

60
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Is this French bread?

61
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
It's really big.

62
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
It's good, right?

63
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
It's French bread, right?

64
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
It's French bread.

65
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
What is this?

66
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
You got a big one again.

67
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
My hands are hot.

68
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
It's hot.

69
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Next to Matsumoto is...

70
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
It's hot.

71
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
It's easy.

72
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
3, 2, 1, go!

73
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
In the first episode of Gaki no Tsukai Ara,

74
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,000
we will play a game to decide who bites the opening title!

75
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
It's hot.

76
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Alright.

77
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
It's really hot.

78
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Let's use the long one instead of the round one.

79
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Let's use the round one or the long one.

80
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
This is good.

81
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
If it sticks to your skin, it's bad for your liver.

82
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
It's hot.

83
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Let's start.

84
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Here are the questions.

85
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Let's see.

86
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
3, 2, 1, go!

87
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000

It's hot.

90
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Good job.

91
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Keep going.

92
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Keep going.

93
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Okay.

94
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Alright.

95
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
3, 2, 1, go!

96
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
In the first episode of Gaki no Tsukai Ara,

97

we will play a game to decide who bites the opening title!

98
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
It's hot.

99
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
It's hot.

100
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
It's hot.

101
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Who is it?

102
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Who is it?

103
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
It's hot.

104
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
It's hot.

105
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I'm holding it.

106
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I'm begging you.

107
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Mr. Hamada.

108
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Are you okay?

109
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
How many people are you?

110
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
You're holding it well.

111
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
How many people are you?

112
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
How many people are you?

113
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Let's start.

114
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Here are the questions.

115
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Here we go.

116
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
3, 2, 1, go!

117
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
In the first episode of Gaki no Tsukai Ara,

118

we will play a game to decide who bites the opening title!

119
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
What is this?

120
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Let's end this with a show.

121
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
What?

122
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I'm risking my life.

123
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
What is this?

124
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
It's hot water.

125
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I think it might be good.

126
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
You're all going this way.

127
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
If you can say it, it's okay.

128
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
If you can say it, it's okay.

129
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
If you can say it, it's okay.

130
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Here are the questions.

131
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Here we go.

132
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
3, 2, 1, go!

133
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
In the first episode of Gaki no Tsukai Ara,

134
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:22,000
we will play a game to decide who bites the opening title!

135
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
3, 2, 1, go!

136
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
In the first episode of Gaki no Tsukai Ara,

137
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:40,000
we will play a game to decide who bites the opening title!

138
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Ladies and gentlemen.

139
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Hello.

140
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Hello.

141
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:59,000
The other day, you were talking about the manager of the house.

142
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
The manager of the house?

143
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Yes, yes.

144
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Our raccoon father, right?

145
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
He's terrible.

146
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
He's terrible.

147
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
He's always in the picture book.

148
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Yes, yes.

149
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
He's the manager of the raccoon family.

150
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Do you know him?

151
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
The father of our pig.

152
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
The father of our pig.

153
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
He hasn't arrived yet.

154
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
How many months has it been?

155
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
It's been about 3 months.

156
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I think he's still in the picture book.

157
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
He's still in the picture book.

158
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
What are you talking about?

159
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I don't know.

160
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
How many times does he apologize in a day?

161
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I'm sorry.

162
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I'm sorry.

163
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Yesterday, I was at the toilet.

164
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I said, I'm going to the toilet.

165
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
He said, yes, go ahead.

166
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
He's always at the toilet.

167
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
He's at the toilet in front of me.

168
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
There's a lot of distance.

169
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
That's right.

170
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
He's good at that.

171
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
It's embarrassing.

172
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
To other managers.

173
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Matsumoto is a king again.

174
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
What are you talking about?

175
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I was walking normally.

176
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
There was a guy like this in front of me.

177
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
That's strange.

178
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
There was a toilet.

179
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
He said, go ahead.

180
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
He went into the toilet.

181
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I don't want you to think it's a joke.

182
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I don't want you to think it's a joke.

183
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
He's not in the toilet at all.

184
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I know.

185
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
He went into the toilet and said, go ahead.

186
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
There's a person who pees in the toilet.

187
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
He opened it and looked at the toilet.

188
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
He said, go ahead.

189
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
You're the one who pees.

190
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
You're the one who pees.

191
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I thought it was strange because I was in the toilet.

192
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I thought he peed in front of me.

193
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I thought he peed in front of me.

194
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I thought he peed in front of me.

195
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
He peed in front of the toilet and said, go ahead.

196
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I laughed a little at that time.

197
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
This is what happens when you always lead people astray.

198
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
He said, go ahead.

199
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Where is the interview room?

200
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Go ahead.

201
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
He opened the door.

202
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I thought it was a meeting.

203
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I thought it was a meeting.

204
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
He looked at me.

205
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
He looked at me.

206
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
He looked at me from behind.

207
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
He said, go ahead.

208
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Give me the phone, Fujiwara.

209
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Yes.

210
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
He was sweating.

211
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
He was sweating.

212
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
That pig was sweating all the time.

213
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
That's strange.

214
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I'm sure he's here.

215
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
He's here.

216
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I'm sure he's here.

217
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
He was laughing like this.

218
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
That's strange.

219
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
After work, I sometimes bring something to give to someone.

220
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Do you know what that is?

221
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I put it in the car.

222
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I took it and looked at it.

223
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I brought it.

224
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I gave it to someone.

225
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I put it in the car.

226
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I'm sorry.

227
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I'm sorry.

228
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
That's strange.

229
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I'm sorry.

230
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Where did you take it?

231
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
That's right.

232
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,000
When I came to work, I didn't have anything to eat.

233
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I shouldn't get angry here.

234
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Fujiwara, I live alone.

235
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I'm a man.

236
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I can't eat breakfast and come to work in the morning.

237
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I don't know.

238
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
When I came to work, I should have something to eat.

239
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
You should have something to eat.

240
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I said that.

241
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I said, I'm sorry.

242
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:42,000
The next day, I was asked if I wanted spaghetti napolitan or bongole.

243
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I said, I don't want it, so I'm doing it properly.

244
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I don't want it.

245
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I can't eat all the food on the menu.

246
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
It's hard.

247
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I said, I don't want it.

248
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
But I'm doing it.

249
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I went to buy a new pair of slippers the other day.

250
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Why don't you wear shoes?

251
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
It's easier to wear slippers.

252
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I went to Ise for a summer trip the other day.

253
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I went to Ise.

254
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Did you wear slippers that day?

255
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I did.

256
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
But it was a summer trip, so it was good.

257
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
The bad thing was that it was in Niigata last winter.

258
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I was wearing slippers when it was snowing heavily.

259
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
It was hard.

260
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Did you go to buy slippers?

261
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I went to buy new slippers.

262
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I only had shoes, slippers, and an umbrella.

263
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
The old man there was so stupid.

264
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
He asked me to give him a pair of slippers for 2,300 yen.

265
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I gave him 3,000 yen for 2,300 yen and a receipt.

266
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I gave him 2,500 yen.

267
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I gave him 2,200 yen.

268
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Which way?

269
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
How many pairs of slippers did you give him?

270
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
What?

271
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
How many pairs of slippers did you give him?

272
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I gave him 1,500 yen.

273
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
You're lying.

274
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
You gave him 2,200 yen.

275
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I gave him 2,500 yen.

276
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
You gave him 2,500 yen.

277
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I gave him 3,000 yen, and the old man said yes, but he didn't move at all.

278
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
He didn't move at all.

279
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
There was an umbrella on top of him.

280
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
The umbrella was a little stuck.

281
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
That's strange.

282
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I know the owner of the store, so I'm sure he'll give me a discount.

283
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,000
An old woman came out of the back of the store and asked me what I was doing.

284
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I don't know what you're doing.

285
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,000
The old man said, I have 2,500 yen, so I'll give you a 300 yen discount.

286
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:44,000
The old woman said, go back to the store.

287
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:52,000
The old man said, 300 yen.

288
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
That's what the old man said.

289
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I gave him 300 yen at the end.

290
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I never saw him again.

291
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I don't know if I'm going to make a fool of myself.

292
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
You have a family.

293
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,000
If I make a fool of myself, no one will take care of me.

294
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
No one will take care of you.

295
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:21,000
When I really make a fool of myself, I want you to take care of me.

296
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Why?

297
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Because I don't have a family.

298
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
You don't have a family?

299
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
After that, I'll make a fool of myself.

300
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
If you make a fool of yourself, your wife and children will take care of me.

301
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:40,000
If you make a fool of yourself, you'll be in downtown.

302
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I don't think you should take care of your wife and children.

303
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I don't think you should.

304
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I'm lonely in the world, so I can't help it.

305
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

306
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
That's impossible.

307
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:02,000
If you two make a fool of yourself, it'll be a mess.

308
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
If you make a fool of yourself, you'll make a fool of yourself.

309
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I'll be fine.

310
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,000
When you feel good, your brain goes like this.

311
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
What do you mean?

312
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
The back of your brain goes like this.

313
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
That doesn't make a fool of yourself.

314
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

315
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I was drowning.

316
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I was trying to make a fool of myself.

317
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I was trying to make a fool of myself.

318
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I've been dating her for three years.

319
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I pay for all the dates.

320
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I can't say I don't have money.

321
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Is there a way to make her pay for all the dates?

322
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I've been dating her for three years.

323
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I've never said I'd pay for all the dates.

324
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:00,000
If that's the case, she's a crazy woman.

325
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Do you pay for all the dates?

326
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Yes, I do.

327
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
When you were single?

328
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Yes.

329
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Do you pay for all the dates?

330
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Yes, I do.

331
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Oh...

332
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
You have a hole in your stomach.

333
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
You pay for all the dates, don't you?

334
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Yes, I do.

335
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I'm older than her.

336
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Older than her?

337
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Yes.

338
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
How old are you?

339
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I'm not that old.

340
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I've never dated an older woman.

341
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I see.

342
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I've never dated an older woman.

343
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:50,000
If I dated an older woman, I'd be much older than her.

344
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
If that's the case, I don't know what will happen.

345
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I don't know if she'll pay for all the dates.

346
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I've never dated an older woman.

347
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Right?

348
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I don't think she'll pay for all the dates.

349
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
It's like I'm the one who pays for all the dates.

350
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I don't think the one who pays for all the dates thinks that way.

351
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I don't think so.

352
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
You're lucky, aren't you?

353
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
There are many ways to do it.

354
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Really?

355
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Yes.

356
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I don't want her to think,

357
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Oh, I paid for all the dates without knowing.

358
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
But I don't feel bad about it.

359
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
There are many ways to do it.

360
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
You should have told me that.

361
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
The man I want to ask is Yamamoto.

362
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Is that so?

363
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
That's right.

364
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Let's tell him.

365
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Let's have a meal together.

366
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,000
What do you mean by a meal?

367
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
That's right.

368
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Let's have a meal together.

369
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
That's fine.

370
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Oh, that's a good idea.

371
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
You should do it too.

372
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Let's have a talk and wine together.

373
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
That's good.

374
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I'll do it.

375
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:15,000
That's fine.

376
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:21,000
It's true.

377
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Well, it was a joke.

378
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
That's right!

379
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
That's ridiculous.

380
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I don't like it when people say that.

381
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
That's ridiculous.

382
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Isn't it?

383
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Only once or twice a year.

384
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
That's right.

385
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
You can't use it.

386
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
It's only once.

387
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I see.

388
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Don't say it!

389
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Please tell me how to make her angry.

390
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
What?

391
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Please tell me how to make a woman angry.

392
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Yes, yes, yes.

393
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I understand.

394
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Men watching TV...

395
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
This is a checkpoint.

396
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
...to make a medicine.

397
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
This is a great place.

398
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
That's right.

399
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
This is for you.

400
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Yes, please.

401
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Thank you.

402
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Well, let's get started.

403
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
That's right.

404
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
What kind of wallet do you have?

405
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
What?

406
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
First of all, don't say what.

407
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
What?

408
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Wallet...

409
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
There are also gifts.

410
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
What kind of wallet do you have?

411
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Something like this.

412
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Let me see.

413
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Do you have something like this?

414
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Yes.

415
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Then, let's go.

416
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
You...

417
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
That's...

418
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
It's a word.

419
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Stop it!

420
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
It's already over.

421
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Stop it!

422
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Not only airplanes...

423
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Yes.

424
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
...but also things that fly in the sky.

425
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Is it true that you always say hello to her?

426
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,000
This may sound like a lie, but it's true.

427
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
If you were walking in the studio...

428
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Yes.

429
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
...and your senior was walking in front of you...

430
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
...you would say hello to her before she said hello to you, right?

431
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Yes, I would say hello to her.

432
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
This is the flow of the world.

433
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
That's right.

434
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
After all, from the lower door to the upper door...

435
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
...you show respect.

436
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I understand that.

437
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Yes.

438
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
But you always say hello to things that fly in the sky.

439
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
That's right.

440
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Even things that fly in the sky...

441
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,000
...they know that I fly in the sky more than I do.

442
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
For example, if I were to fly a jumbo jet...

443
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,000
...I would fly like this, but Matsumoto-san...

444
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
...would say, if Matsumoto-san were to fly, it wouldn't be like this.

445
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
That's something that even Jumbo knows.

446
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Matsumoto-san is the only one who can't do that.

447
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Jumbo knows that I can't say that.

448
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
I'm drowning.

449
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
That's a lot.

450
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
You're asking too much.

451
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Judgment Matsumoto's Which is Great?

452
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Yasawa Eikichi and Nagamichi Tsuyoshi.

453
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
I'm sorry, I'm not good at studying. I don't know either of them.

454
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Hey!

455
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Which do you think is great?

456
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
I have a lot of opinions on this.

457
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Which do you think is great?

458
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Don't react like that!

459
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Don't react like that!

460
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Well, for me...

461
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
I think it's...

462
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
And...

463
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Well...

464
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I think it's Shino Okan.

465
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Jumbo Ozaki and Jumbo Jet.

466
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
This is Jumbo Jet.

467
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
That's true.

468
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
That's true.

469
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Ashika no Sho and Ashita no Jouma.

470
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Well...

471
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
This is Ashika no Sho.

472
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
That's true.

473
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
This is Ashika no Sho.

474
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
This is Ashika no Sho.

475
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
That's true.

476
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
It's not Ashita no Jou.

477
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Nittere's 24-hour television is Fujii's 27-hour television.

478
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
This is Fujii's 27-hour television.

479
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Why?

480
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:25,000
But if you run on Nittere's 24-hour television, your image will improve.

481
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
You should run next year too.

482
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Why?

483
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,000
If you run on Hamada's 24-hour television, your image will improve.

484
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
You should run next year too.

485
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
You should run next year too.

486
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
I can't.

487
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Why?

488
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
I can't.

489
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
I can't take off my clothes.

490
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Take off your clothes?

491
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Take off your clothes?

492
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,000
I'll think about it next year.

493
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
You should do good things sometimes.

494
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
I'll definitely run.

495
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
You should do good things sometimes.

496
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Let's run together.

497
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
What do you mean?

498
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Let's run together.

499
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Even if we run together, it's different.

500
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
What's different?

501
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Our pace doesn't match.

502
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
It's like this.

503
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Here we go.

504
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Start.

505
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
It's completely different.

506
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,000
We run at the same pace all the time.

507
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Do you understand?

508
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Do you think you can run at the same pace all the time?

509
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Why?

510
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
At such a fast pace.

511
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Why?

512
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Start.

513
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
You can run at the same pace all the time.

514
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
It's impossible.

515
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
I can't keep up with you.

516
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
I can't keep up with you.

517
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
It's hard.

518
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
I can't keep up with you.

519
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Do your best.

520
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
That's why.

521
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Why?

522
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
If you want to run, tell me.

523
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
I'll do my best to support you.

524
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
You don't do anything?

525
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
No.

526
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
You don't do anything else?

527
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
I don't do anything else.

528
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
You don't do anything else?

529
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
You don't do anything else?

530
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
You don't do anything else?

531
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
You don't do anything else?

532
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
It's hard.

533
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:23,000
This program was brought to you by these sponsors.
