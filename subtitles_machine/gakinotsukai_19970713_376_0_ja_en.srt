1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000
This program is brought to you by the following sponsors.

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
What to do. What to do. The natural destruction caused by the civilized society.

3
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Let me introduce the cast.

4
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
First of all, the first person to deal with the environmental pollution of the earth.

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Professor of the former Cambridge University, Mr. Hitoshi Matsumoto, who presided over the World Natural Protection Campaign.

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Mr. Hosei Yamazaki, chairman of the World Dirt Deposit Committee, who said that he was interested in the dirt of the earth by his own dirt.

7
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Mr. Shouzo Endo, a member of the Seto Inland Sea Fisheries Association, who woke up from Shikoku to say that he would like to make an appeal to the ocean in recent years.

8
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:21,980
Mr. Naoki Tanaka, the director of the Blue Sky and Sun

9
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:28,000
Mr. Kenji Suga, the director of the Nangoku branch of the National Nature Company.

10
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Mr. Kozo Komurasaki, a member of the Japan Agriculture Association, who strongly opposes forest deforestation and continues to support Japan's agriculture.

11
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Mr. Yoshinobu Nakamura, a heat island narcissist who continues to fight with the country on the issue of global warming.

12
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Mr. Akihiro Ohnuma, chairman of the Tateyama Tanuki Association, who has been observing the ecology of wild animals in Japan for 15 years.

13
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:05,000
And Mr. Souichiro Hamada, the host of the discussion program.

14
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Good evening, everyone. Today's theme is the natural disaster that will affect the civilized society, and there are three years left in the 20th century.

15
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Today, I would like to discuss what we should do in the face of the global warming, and what is important for us human beings.

16
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I will listen to your opinions little by little. Mr. Tanaka, what do you think?

17
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Well, I think we have to pay more attention to the current environment in Japan.

18
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
What do you mean?

19
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
For example, the construction of golf courses.

20
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
We are building more and more golf courses, even though we have plenty of them.

21
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I think the current Japanese government's leisure facilities are strange.

22
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
What do you think, Mr. Sugata?

23
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I don't think that's right.

24
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Mr. Tanaka?

25
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Mr. Tanaka?

26
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Golf is something that should be done.

27
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
It's not that. The person who does it is the most important person.

28
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
The person who doesn't do it is the least important person.

29
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
It's not that we should do it.

30
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Well, if you ask me...

31
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
It's strange to say something like this on a day like this.

32
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Well, let's say...

33
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Even if you put it on a signboard...

34
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Even if you put it on a signboard...

35
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
It's made out of wood.

36
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
It's made out of wood.

37
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Isn't that strange?

38
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
No, it's not.

39
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
That's right.

40
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
By cutting down the forest, it will eventually be destroyed.

41
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Because humans need oxygen to breathe.

42
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I think it's very problematic to cut down the forest that produces oxygen.

43
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
What do you think, Mr. Aonuma?

44
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
When it comes to making a golf course...

45
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Wild raccoons and foxes...

46
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
No, no.

47
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
You're saying that because you're bad at golf.

48
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
No, it's not like that.

49
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Well, let's listen to him.

50
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
You're saying that you're bad at golf.

51
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Why do you keep making golf courses?

52
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
No, it's not like that.

53
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:51,000
It's not just humans who live in this world.

54
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,000
If you think about that and cut down the forest...

55
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Wait a minute.

56
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Komura, what do you think?

57
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I'm listening to your opinions from here.

58
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I'd like to ask you how much you understand the importance of nature.

59
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
No, no.

60
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
What's important is important, but...

61
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
It's a matter of temperature, isn't it?

62
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
In the end, the destruction of nature is...

63
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
That's right.

64
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Nature is important to humans.

65
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
That's right.

66
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
It gives us peace of mind.

67
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Does everyone understand that?

68
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Mr. Aonuma, what do you think?

69
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
That's definitely true.

70
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Nature is important to animals, isn't it?

71
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
That's right.

72
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Mr. Nakamura, what do you think?

73
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,000
The warming is going on now.

74
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:09,000
What we have to think about now is how to stop the warming.

75
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Mr. Matsumoto, why are you laughing?

76
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I'm not laughing.

77
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
What do you think?

78
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I'm not in a position to say anything about the destruction of nature.

79
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
What do you mean?

80
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,000
When you come here, you come here by car.

81
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Whether you take the train or take the bus, you come here.

82
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,000
At that point, I think we're destroying nature.

83
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Mr. Aonuma, what do you think?

84
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Wild animals are said to be decreasing every 13 minutes.

85
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:01,000
If that's the case, we have to think about the destruction of humanity.

86
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Thousands of years ago, there was only one animal per year.

87
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Wait a minute.

88
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Mr. Tanaka, what do you think?

89
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:36,000
After all, there are times when the life of an animal can be stolen by human waste.

90
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I don't have a shirt.

91
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I want to say something.

92
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,000
What do you think about the destruction of nature?

93
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
There are people who play golf.

94
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
You don't have a shirt.

95
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I think it has nothing to do with the environment.

96
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Mr. Endo, what do you think?

97
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I play golf, but I think there is a problem with the sea and the fish in the sea.

98
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Mr. Tanaka, what do you think?

99
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
It's a problem that pollutes the sea.

100
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Everyone's opinion is wrong.

101
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I think we should learn more about the sea.

102
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Mr. Masao, what do you think?

103
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I'm sorry.

104
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
It can't be helped.

105
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
What about Mr. Yamasaki?

106
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I think it has nothing to do with golf.

107
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:13,000
It is the first step of nature.

108
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,000
It can't be helped.

109
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:25,000
It has nothing to do with the environment.

110
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
What about the body?

111
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I think it has nothing to do with the environment.

112
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
It has nothing to do with the environment.

113
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Mr. Yamasaki, you don't understand the meaning.

114
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Mr. Komura, what do you think?

115
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I don't understand your opinion.

116
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Why do you say that?

117
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Are you a woman or a man?

118
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I'm a man.

119
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
That's okay.

120
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Golf is okay.

121
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
The sea is okay.

122
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
What else?

123
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
The sky.

124
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
The sky?

125
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
The environment is bad.

126
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
What do you think?

127
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Mr. Masao, what do you think?

128
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I'm sorry.

129
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
It can't be helped.

130
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
What about the sky?

131
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,000
The sky is gray.

132
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
What are you talking about?

133
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
It's just the weather.

134
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
It's a cloudy sky.

135
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
It's because the sky is strong.

136
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:36,000
It's because the sky is strong.

137
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:14,000
It's because the sky is strong.

138
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Well...

139
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
It seems that our stories are different.

140
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I don't know what to do.

141
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Can someone summarize it for me?

142
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Can anyone do it?

143
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I think the individual should think more.

144
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I think you should think more about Japan.

145
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I often go abroad.

146
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
When I go abroad, I see a lot of stars.

147
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I can't see it in Tokyo.

148
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
For example?

149
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
India.

150
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
India?

151
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I don't understand the story.

152
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I can't see it.

153
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
What do you think about wild animals?

154
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:05,000
There are a lot of wild animals.

155
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,000
There are a lot of wild animals called natural monuments.

156
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I think this is strange.

157
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
There are a lot of wild animals.

158
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I think it's strange that it becomes a natural monument.

159
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I think the individual should think more.

160
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
What do you think, Mr. Suga?

161
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I can't let Mr. Onuma come to the competition.

162
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
You are particular about it.

163
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I don't want him to come.

164
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I'm talking about environmental destruction.

165
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Mr. Onuma comes to the golf course every time.

166
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
It's not a shot.

167
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
It's not a play.

168
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
A few hectares of forest has been destroyed.

169
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
A raccoon is in the forest.

170
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
You're talking about a raccoon.

171
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I'm a party to protect the raccoon.

172
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
That's what happens.

173
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
What's going to happen?

174
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
You're talking about a raccoon.

175
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
You're talking about a raccoon.

176
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:24,000
It's the end of the ecosystem.

177
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I have to stop it here.

178
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
There were three raccoons in Tateyama last year.

179
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Who?

180
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Think about it on a global scale.

181
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
What do you think, Mr. Matsumoto?

182
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:43,000
To be honest, I think there's a problem.

183
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I see.

184
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
No, that's not true.

185
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I think it's a disorganized meeting.

186
00:13:51,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I think everyone is aware of it.

187
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
It's not just from tomorrow.

188
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
We have to do it now.

189
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
What's going on with electric cars?

190
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I see.

191
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,000
The exhaust gas will be gone.

192
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Electric cars won't help the environment.

193
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I want to tell the company about it.

194
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:28,000
We need solar power to make electricity.

195
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:35,000
We need to protect the sky from the sun.

196
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
What do you mean?

197
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
We need solar power to make electricity.

198
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
We need the power of the sun.

199
00:14:45,000 --> 00:15:14,000
We need the power of the sun.

200
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Damn it.

201
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
What's this?

202
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Damn it.

203
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
As I said before, we need solar power.

204
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:37,000
We need to think about it.

205
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I think it's impossible to fix the earth.

206
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I see.

207
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I can't open it.

208
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I can't figure it out.

209
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
What do you think?

210
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:14,000
From today, tomorrow, and the day after tomorrow,

211
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,000
we can do one thing at a time.

212
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
What do you mean by yesterday?

213
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I'm sorry.

214
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
You don't know what you're doing.

215
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Yes.

216
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Let's think about it.

217
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
That's a good idea.

218
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I don't know.

219
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I think it's better not to get in the car from tomorrow.

220
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
You don't get in the car, do you?

221
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
As I said before, it's not from tomorrow.

222
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I'm already a champion.

223
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,000
So, from today.

224
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I see.

225
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
When I leave this place, I'll walk home.

226
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I see.

227
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
What do you think, Endo?

228
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,000
This country is a developed country.

229
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I think we need to make it a law.

230
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I think we can do one simple thing.

231
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
If the garbage is falling, everyone picks up the garbage.

232
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
That's the only way to improve the environment.

233
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
That's not what I mean.

234
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Don't drop the garbage.

235
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I see.

236
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
That's a good idea.

237
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
What do you think, Nakano?

238
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I'm a natural person.

239
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I don't throw away the garbage.

240
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I see.

241
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I think it's better to start with small things.

242
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
What do you think, Matsumoto?

243
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I'm going to tell you from tomorrow.

244
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
It's not from tomorrow.

245
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
It's now.

246
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Now?

247
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I don't know why you don't think about it.

248
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Well, well, well.

249
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I can't talk to you while I'm saying that.

250
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Well, well, well.

251
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
You mean we should do our best, right?

252
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Yes.

253
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Am I wrong?

254
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Well, that's your opinion.

255
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Let's do our best.

256
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
It's important.

257
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
What do you think, Yasugawa?

258
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Well, I think we should stop throwing away garbage and make it a law.

259
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I see.

260
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
We shouldn't cut down the grass.

261
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
I see.

262
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
What do you think, Tanaka?

263
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I was disappointed to come here today.

264
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I was disappointed in your lack of consciousness.

265
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Consciousness?

266
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
This is a good place.

267
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,000
I've realized what I usually say.

268
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I've finally realized what I usually say.

269
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I can't talk to you anymore.

270
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I won't come here again.

271
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Don't say that.

272
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I see.

273
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
What about you, Yasugawa?

274
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I want you to stop throwing away garbage.

275
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I think we should exchange opinions and do our best.

276
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I see.

277
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Am I wrong?

278
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I've heard a lot of opinions from you.

279
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
But I can't do it.

280
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I can't do it.

281
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
That's all for today.

282
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Let's meet again next time.

283
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Let's meet again next time.

284
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Let's meet again next time.

285
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
OK?

286
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Let's meet again next time.

287
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Let's discuss it again.

288
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Thank you for coming today.

289
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Thank you.

290
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
To Be Continued...

291
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
To Be Continued...

292
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Well...

293
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
It's over, isn't it?

294
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
It's over.

295
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
It's over.

296
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Well...

297
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I'm sure you have your excuses.

298
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Yes.

299
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
You want to make an excuse, don't you?

300
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
What are you talking about?

301
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I don't want to make an excuse.

302
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
There was a long nose.

303
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Was it long?

304
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I thought it was a mistake.

305
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I thought it was a mistake.

306
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
I see.

307
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I was surprised.

308
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I guess you didn't have the skill to follow us.

309
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I guess so.

310
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
That's true.

311
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
How did it go?

312
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
What did you guys say?

313
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Well...

314
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Well...

315
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
I guess it was a long nose.

316
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
It's a long nose if you laugh every day.

317
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
It's funny even if I see it now.

318
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
It's funny even if I see it now.

319
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
It's funny even if I see it now.

320
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
What is it?

321
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Is it a god's word?

322
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
What is it?

323
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
What is it?

324
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
It's funny.

325
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Well...

326
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
It's over today.

327
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Yes, it's over.

328
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Well...

329
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Well...

330
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
You said you wouldn't get in the car.

331
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I said it.

332
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
You said it.

333
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I did.

334
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,000
I think it's better not to get in the car from tomorrow.

335
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
You won't get in, right?

336
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
That's right.

337
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
I'm sure of it.

338
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Well...

339
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Well...

340
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I've prepared something for you.

341
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,000
That thing from Hawaii.

342
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
I've prepared something for you.

343
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
If you're going to say something like that...

344
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
You can just walk home.

345
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
You said it yourself.

346
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
I was looking forward to it when you said it.

347
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
I was scared.

348
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Shall we go home?

349
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Let's go home.

350
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Is he coming?

351
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Where do you live?

352
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Odaiba.

353
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
In Odaiba?

354
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
If it wasn't a car, what train would it be?

355
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,000
It would be the Yurikamon line.

356
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
It's a picture.

357
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
It's a picture.

358
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
What? I don't get it.

359
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
I don't get it at all.

360
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
It's a natural theory.

361
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
It's like Odaiba.

362
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Odaiba.

363
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,000
It's like Odaiba.

364
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Can I take a picture of you?

365
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Can I take a picture of you now?

366
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Can I take a picture of you now?

367
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
This is interesting.

368
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
This is interesting.

369
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,000
I like the way you're going to say it.

370
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
That's right.

371
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,000
It's the first time I've seen you say that you're not jealous.

372
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I've seen that.

373
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Don't say that.

374
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Don't say that you're not jealous.

375
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
We're living together.

376
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,000
The first time I saw you, you looked like a fool.

377
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
You looked like this.

378
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
I see.

379
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,000
When you get on the train, you can draw a figure.

380
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Like a girl's loose socks.

381
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
You can go to the bathroom.

382
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:26,000
You can go to Ginza line.

383
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,000
You look like a girl's loose socks.

384
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:35,000
I'm a little scared.

385
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Thank you for your hard work.

386
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
I'm Osaki.

387
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
You still look like a girl's loose socks.

388
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
You still look like a girl's loose socks.

389
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
I'm Osaki.

390
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:51,000
You're still a girl's loose socks.

391
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Thank you for your hard work.

392
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Love Hurts

393
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:17,000
A small incident

394
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:24,000
hurt my love.

395
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:31,000
You jumped out of the room.

396
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Under the winter sky.

397
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Like the falling snow.

398
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:55,000
I should have loved you.

399
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Like the falling snow.

400
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Our love is.

401
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Next is Takeshiba.
