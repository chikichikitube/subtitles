1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Ladies and gentlemen.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Thank you very much.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Thank you very much.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Today we have a special for the kids.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
We usually have 30 minutes, but how many minutes do we have today?

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
2 hours.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
2 hours?

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Normally we would have a special.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Right?

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Right, right, right.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
With the guests behind us.

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
It's not like that at all.

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
It's the same as usual.

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
The guests are all dirty.

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
It's 1.5 times dirtier than usual.

16
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
It's dirtier than usual?

17
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
You can see the moment when they come out, right?

18
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
The way they scream.

19
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Right?

20
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I can feel it.

21
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I can feel it.

22
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
How was it today?

23
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Well, well, well.

24
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
The guests that came out today were

25
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
more than we expected.

26
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
We were 190 and 180.

27
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
More than we expected?

28
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
It's bigger than what we see on TV.

29
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
That's what they said.

30
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
That's what they said.

31
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
That's what they thought.

32
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Well, well, well.

33
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
They were surprised.

34
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
That's right.

35
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I see.

36
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Today is a special.

37
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Yes, yes.

38
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Today we have a punishment game.

39
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Before I came here, I put on a red and white mask and lost.

40
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
You thought you wouldn't be able to do it, right?

41
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Yes, yes.

42
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Because it was last year's Kure.

43
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I thought the people who were watching wouldn't be able to do it.

44
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Yes, yes.

45
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Well, today is a special.

46
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I was surprised by that punishment game.

47
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I was.

48
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
You dressed up as a dog from Hokuto.

49
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Why?

50
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,000
You went to that place and said you were already dead.

51
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Gaki no Tsukai Ara Endo Special Chikizuki Gouhou Matsumoto Ahohagaku Aomada Oekaki Dojo Bunkajin-hen

52
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I did it once.

53
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Everyone was so angry that they didn't like your poor painting.

54
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Today, we have guests.

55
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Today is a Bunkajin-hen.

56
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Bunkajin.

57
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
But usually, I think that person is smart.

58
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
It's wonderful.

59
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I think smart people have all sides.

60
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Well, let's see how it goes.

61
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Let's go.

62
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Please welcome tonight's guests.

63
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
It's amazing.

64
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Shizu, Shizu.

65
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Wajima-san, you came in nicely.

66
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Well, let's introduce them.

67
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
First, from this side, the political commentator, Shota Mano-san.

68
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Next, the talent commentator, Yamaguchi Mie-san.

69
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Next, the former Japanese TV announcer, Kobayashi Kawako-san.

70
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Next, the professor of Waseda University, Otsuki Yoshiko-san.

71
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Next, the student actor, Nakajima Keigo-san.

72
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Next, the professor of Waseda University, the Egyptian researcher, Yoshimura Sakuji-san.

73
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Next, the research scientist, Ichida Hiromi-san.

74
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Lastly, the former boxing world champion, Koichi Wajima-san.

75
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Wajima-san, can I come in?

76
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
What is it?

77
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Wajima-san, how is your drawing?

78
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
It's a square, isn't it?

79
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Yes, yes, yes.

80
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
A square?

81
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I like to see it.

82
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
How about Maruo?

83
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Do you draw?

84
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Do you usually draw?

85
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I draw a lot, but I haven't drawn much.

86
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Everyone, you have your sketchbooks at home.

87
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Yes, yes.

88
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
First, the first topic, please.

89
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Doraemon.

90
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Everyone, please draw Doraemon.

91
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Doraemon.

92
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I'm pretty confident.

93
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Huh? Something is missing.

94
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
No, I can definitely do this.

95
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I don't know at all.

96
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
No, seriously, seriously.

97
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Everyone, I'm sorry to disappoint you.

98
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
It's perfect.

99
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Really, really, really.

100
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Doraemon is perfect.

101
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
This is OK.

102
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Then, let's see from this side.

103
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Otsuki-san.

104
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Otsuki, Otsuki.

105
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
What is this?

106
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Isn't that a monster?

107
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
The nose is like this.

108
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I have the impression that it's coming out.

109
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
The end is getting interesting.

110
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Now, Kango-chan.

111
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Is this an overkill?

112
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Is this an overkill?

113
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
No.

114
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Please take it out.

115
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Yes, Miya-san.

116
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,000
This is the closest I've ever drawn.

117
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Why does it look like Fuji?

118
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Now, Mano-chan.

119
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
No, I don't know.

120
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
What is that?

121
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I've heard of an overkill.

122
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
That's all an overkill.

123
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Doraemon.

124
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Doraemon?

125
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Doraemon.

126
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
What do you do at a sweets festival?

127
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Now, Wajima-san.

128
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
What is this?

129
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Wajima-san, isn't that a condom?

130
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,000
As expected, there's a reason why it's called Gouko Matsumoto.

131
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
This is it.

132
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
This is it.

133
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Then, it's Bakagawa-kun.

134
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
No, it's not Bakagawa-kun.

135
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
It looks exactly like him.

136
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Doraemon.

137
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
It's got vinegar on it.

138
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
It's got a thread on it.

139
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Now, it's called warming up.

140
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
What's the next subject?

141
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Over here.

142
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Cow.

143
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Now, everyone, please draw a cow.

144
00:06:47,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Cow.

145
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:23,000
First, let's take a look at the cow in the picture.

146
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
It's still big.

147
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Is it okay?

148
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
It's cool.

149
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Is it cool?

150
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
The face is like this.

151
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Is it okay?

152
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Yes.

153
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
It's okay, isn't it?

154
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I can't tell if it's good weather or not.

155
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Now, Yoshima-san.

156
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,000
It's good.

157
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Where?

158
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Here.

159
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
It looks like a sick cow.

160
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
It's close.

161
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
It looks like a cow.

162
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
It doesn't look like a cow.

163
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
The color is...

164
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
It's not good.

165
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
It's not good.

166
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I got it.

167
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Yes.

168
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Now, Kyo-jun.

169
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
You make me laugh.

170
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
It's a cow.

171
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
It's not a cow.

172
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,000
It's a chimp.

173
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Kamo-san.

174
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Now, Mie-san.

175
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I can't say anything.

176
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
The idea is poor.

177
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Everyone thinks it's a standing cow.

178
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I can say that.

179
00:08:50,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Now, Bakagawa-kun.

180
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Are you serious?

181
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
If you paint it black, it won't look good.

182
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I forgot to paint it.

183
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
What kind of old man is this?

184
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
This is...

185
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Is this Maro-chan?

186
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Yes.

187
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Shota-san, let's go.

188
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
This is a high point.

189
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
It's good.

190
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I got it.

191
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Please show me the answer.

192
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Angel.

193
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Angel?

194
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Angel.

195
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Angel.

196
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Angel.

197
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Angel.

198
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Angel.

199
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I'm really embarrassed.

200
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
But...

201
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Maro-chan, show me.

202
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Is that so?

203
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
It's beautiful.

204
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
It's not bad.

205
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I see.

206
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
It's calm.

207
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I think it's okay.

208
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Mie-san.

209
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Did you add something?

210
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I didn't add anything.

211
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I didn't add anything.

212
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Mie-san.

213
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
It's not an angel.

214
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Yes.

215
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
It's not an angel.

216
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Why did you draw a cloud?

217
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
It's hard to draw a cloud.

218
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
So I drew a cloud.

219
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,000
The sun is shining.

220
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I drew the whole picture.

221
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
But the face is messy.

222
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
It's an old picture.

223
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I drew both.

224
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
An adult and a child.

225
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
This is good.

226
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I see.

227
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I drew this before.

228
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
It's really bad.

229
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
It's worse than this.

230
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
That's a bug.

231
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
What is yours?

232
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Yours.

233
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Yours.

234
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Marimo-san, who drew a small statue?

235
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
It's completely different, isn't it?

236
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
It's similar to mine.

237
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Only the plate is similar.

238
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
It's the same.

239
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I'm good at this.

240
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Let's see your stupid drawing.

241
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
This is good.

242
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Who drew a college student?

243
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
What is it?

244
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
What is it?

245
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,000
But it's better than this.

246
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Why did you draw a student?

247
00:11:52,000 --> 00:12:21,000
What is it?

248
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
It's not like this.

249
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
You're good.

250
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:31,000
You're good.

251
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
It's cute.

252
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,000
It's better than before.

253
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
It's messy.

254
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Where did you draw me?

255
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I made a mistake.

256
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
But the plate is good.

257
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
It's great.

258
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
It's glowing.

259
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Please give me the last one.

260
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Sphinx.

261
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Yoshimura-san, if you don't draw well, it won't be funny.

262
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Please give me the last one.

263
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Yoshimura-san is crying.

264
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Are you ready?

265
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,000
It seems that the stupid drawing is not over yet.

266
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:36,000
It's useless to continue.

267
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:44,000
It's okay.

268
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Let's see your drawing.

269
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I don't understand.

270
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
It's messy.

271
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Sphinx is in the middle.

272
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Let's see your drawing.

273
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I don't remember.

274
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I don't know.

275
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Don't say it.

276
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I know.

277
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,000
It's okay.

278
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Kawago-san.

279
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I understand.

280
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Sphinx.

281
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:33,000
It's a break.

282
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I don't want to show it.

283
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
What is it?

284
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
This is difficult.

285
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,000
It's difficult to understand.

286
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Nakajima-san.

287
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
This is it.

288
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Ichida-san.

289
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
It's embarrassing.

290
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
It's okay.

291
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:05,000
It's messy next to you.

292
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,000
It's scary.

293
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I was surprised.

294
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
It's messy.

295
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
It's Sphinx.

296
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Welcome.

297
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Let's see your drawing.

298
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
How is it?

299
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
This is a world-famous drawing.

300
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,000
This is a low school student.

301
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Let's see your drawing.

302
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I'm a junior high school student.

303
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
You are not good at drawing.

304
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I'm not good at drawing.

305
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I have a personality.

306
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
My hair is messy.

307
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I can't express it.

308
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Let's see your drawing.

309
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I have no comment.

310
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Your drawing.

311
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Who is Koshino Junko?

312
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:26,000
What is it?

313
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
You are amazing.

314
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
What are you talking about?

315
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
You are the winner of the first prize.

316
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Thank you very much.

317
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I can't reach my hand.

318
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I can't reach my hand.

319
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:56,000
When I went to the store, the staff told me that it was sold out.

320
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
You can't say that.

321
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I checked it myself.

322
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I went to Okinawa for a drama special.

323
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Are you doing a drama?

324
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I can't do it.

325
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I can't do it.

326
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Listen to me.

327
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I went to Okinawa.

328
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Okinawa?

329
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I can't hear you.

330
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I went to Okinawa.

331
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Why can't I kiss my partner?

332
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I went to Okinawa.

333
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
There was a record store.

334
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I visited the record store.

335
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I didn't understand it.

336
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Do you have an H-Jungle CD?

337
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I don't have it now.

338
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Really?

339
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I don't know when he'll come in.

340
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Oh, really?

341
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I don't know why that song is selling so well.

342
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
But that's a good thing.

343
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
The young clerk's brother was cleaning up the CD over here.

344
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
When he heard that, he looked at me and said,

345
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Oh!

346
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
My brother was half-laughing.

347
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I was being scolded by the old man.

348
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
The old man doesn't know why that song is selling so well.

349
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
But that's a good thing.

350
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,000
That's why I felt it when I saw it.

351
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I didn't go to Okinawa.

352
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
As a member of H-Jun...

353
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
That's true.

354
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
As a member of H-Jun...

355
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
But really, Moukyo,

356
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I'm not kidding.

357
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Please make this into an episode.

358
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
This is really serious.

359
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
That's not for me to decide.

360
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
No, no.

361
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
That's for Komuro to decide.

362
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
No, no.

363
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
That's for Komuro to decide.

364
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
No, no.

365
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Hey, wait.

366
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
You're the only one who can say that.

367
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Hey, I'm begging you.

368
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Say it.

369
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
This is a serious matter.

370
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I'm trying my best.

371
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
B.

372
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
B.

373
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Hey.

374
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Don't talk about money.

375
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Hey.

376
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Don't talk about money in that sense.

377
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Lend me some money.

378
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I'll pay you every week.

379
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
What are you talking about?

380
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I want you to give me some money.

381
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Why should I give you money?

382
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
You said you'd give me money for the record.

383
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
That's true.

384
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I want you to give me money for the record.

385
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
It's all for Komuro.

386
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
It's not for me to decide.

387
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
You're right.

388
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I'll do my best.

389
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
This is a serious matter.

390
00:19:50,000 --> 00:20:01,000
I'm sorry for your stupid song.

391
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
But it's a little difficult.

392
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
It's easy to remember.

393
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:11,000
It's easy to remember.

394
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I'm really sorry.

395
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I didn't know you could do that.

396
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,000
I'm sorry for the musicians.

397
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Do you have a girlfriend?

398
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I don't have a girlfriend.

399
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Let's buy a girlfriend.

400
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
I'm sorry.

401
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:32,000
I'm sorry.

402
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I don't like that.

403
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
It doesn't matter.

404
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
It doesn't matter.

405
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
It doesn't matter.

406
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
You're mean.

407
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:44,000
You're mean.

408
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
It's hot.

409
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
It's hot.

410
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
It's really hot.

411
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
It's really hot.

412
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
I can't sleep well.

413
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Is that so?

414
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
My body is especially hot.

415
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I couldn't sleep because of the election.

416
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Is that so?

417
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Can you sleep?

418
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
I can't sleep because of the election.

419
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
I don't think so.

420
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I can't sleep because of the election.

421
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:23,000
I can't sleep because of the election.

422
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,000
That's a phenomenon.

423
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
It's not a big phenomenon.

424
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
It's a phenomenon.

425
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
It's a phenomenon.

426
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:37,000
It's a phenomenon.

427
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,000
I can't sleep until the morning.

428
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Your voice won't cross my ears.

429
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
I can't sleep because of the election.

430
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
That's a phenomenon.

431
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
I can't sleep because of the election.

432
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I've heard it.

433
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:58,000
3 minutes.

434
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Just once in a while.

435
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Do you think 3 minutes will come just once in a while?

436
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Time goes faster as the election is in progress.

437
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Even if I'm scared, I can't sleep.

438
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
I want to go to bed.

439
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,320
You're still saying it...

440
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:14,520
I'm sorry.

441
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:15,500
I'm sorry.

442
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,860
I'm sorry.

443
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:20,960
I'm sorry.

444
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:22,380
I'm sorry.

445
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:30,640
Why don't you assume someone is a member of your team?!

446
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:34,240
You're a ignored member.

447
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,240
You have a lot of money.

448
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:43,240
I'm not asking you to give me money.

449
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:45,240
I don't know what you're talking about.

450
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:48,240
I don't care about the money in the CD.

451
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,240
I don't care about it.

452
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,240
It's strange at this point.

453
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,240
No, it's not.

454
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:56,240
No, it's not.

455
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,240
That's the kind of hand you have.

456
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,240
No, I don't have money.

457
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:03,240
I don't have money, but I hate your money.

458
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:05,240
Why don't you give me some money?

459
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,240
I don't care about it!

460
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,240
I don't care about it!

461
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:12,240
I'm going to make you a lot of money.

462
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:18,240
You have a lot of money.

463
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:22,240
I'll take it.

464
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,240
That's the pattern.

465
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,240
What is it?

466
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:27,240
You don't have money.

467
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,240
Why do you have money?

468
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:31,240
I don't have money.

469
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:33,240
What? What do you mean?

470
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,240
What do you mean?

471
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,240
I said I have money.

472
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,240
Don't say that.

473
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,240
I don't have money.

474
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,240
Do you want money that much?

475
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,240
That's why.

476
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:41,240
No, really, really.

477
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,240
Look at that.

478
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,240
Look at that.

479
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:47,240
You want a lot of money.

480
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,240
I saw it because you told me to look at it.

481
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,240
You said it was 1,000 yen.

482
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:57,240
You want a lot of money.

483
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,240
Why?

484
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,240
You're so mean.

485
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,240
You're so mean.

486
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,240
Do you want to look at it?

487
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,240
You can't do that.

488
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:12,240
I'm really in trouble.

489
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,240
It's not that bad.

490
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:15,240
It's really bad.

491
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,240
What's bad?

492
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:19,240
I'm in trouble this month.

493
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,240
What kind of life are you living?

494
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,240
How much do you spend a month?

495
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,240
I don't use it.

496
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,240
I don't have much money.

497
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,240
I've been scraped.

498
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,240
Don't say that.

499
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,240
I've been scraped.

500
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,240
Why?

501
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:39,240
That's enough.

502
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,240
What do you use it for?

503
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,240
No.

504
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:46,240
You're doing a lot of dirty things.

505
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,240
You're snacking.

506
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,240
I'm not snacking.

507
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,240
Wait a minute.

508
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,240
I'm not snacking.

509
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,240
Don't say that I'm dirty.

510
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,240
You're dyeing your hair.

511
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,240
I'm not dirty.

512
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,240
You're spitting.

513
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,240
Why would I spit?

514
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,240
I'm not spitting.

515
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,240
You're holding an accordion.

516
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,240
Don't say that.

517
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,240
I've been scraped.

518
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,240
I've been scraped.

519
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:13,240
I've been scraped 16 times.

520
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,240
You're lying.

521
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,240
You're lying.

522
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,240
You've been scraped 16 times?

523
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,240
That's what it is.

524
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,240
Are you stupid?

525
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,240
I don't feel good.

526
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,240
I don't feel good.

527
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:25,240
How many times have you been scraped?

528
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:28,240
I don't know what to do if I get sick.

529
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:31,240
What if you end up in the hospital?

530
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:40,240
Promise me in front of the TV that you won't sell the CD.

531
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:43,240
I don't care.

532
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:45,240
You don't care.

533
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:47,240
You're holding an accordion.

534
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,240
No.

535
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,240
Don't say that.

536
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,240
I'm desperate.

537
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,240
I'm desperate for money.

538
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,240
I don't need that.

539
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:59,240
I don't need it.

540
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:01,240
You're stupid.

541
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:03,240
Why are you quiet?

542
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:08,240
You've done this CD money downtown.

543
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,240
Don't say that this is spitting.

544
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:17,240
Then the people around you will cry.

545
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,240
Why?

546
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:23,240
The people around you will cry.

547
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:25,240
Then the people around you will cry.

548
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:28,240
Hama-chan, your partner is heavy.

549
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,240
What?

550
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,240
What?

551
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:33,240
Why are you so depressed?

552
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:38,240
I'm saying you shouldn't do that.

553
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,240
I'm not persuasive.

554
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,240
Please do that.

555
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:48,240
You signed the contract in March, didn't you?

556
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,240
What's a contract?

557
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,240
It's a new song.

558
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,240
I don't care if you get angry.

559
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:05,240
The new song is over.

560
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,240
Ah, the new song.

561
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,240
When will the new song come out?

562
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,240
Wow.

563
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,240
What?

564
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,240
Which one is it?

565
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,240
I'm talking about April.

566
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,240
You're talking about June.

567
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:17,240
Say it clearly, you idiot.

568
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,240
Wow.

569
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,240
Say it came out around May.

570
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,240
Let's say it came out.

571
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,240
It's number one.

572
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,240
What?

573
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,240
It's number one.

574
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,240
It's number one.

575
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,240
It's number one.

576
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,240
It's number one.

577
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,240
It's number one.

578
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,240
It's number one.

579
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,240
It's number one.

580
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,240
It's number one.

581
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:39,240
It's number one so there's no way it would be left.

582
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,240
My underwear is torn.

583
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:50,240
No matter how hard I try, the torn underwear doesn't work.

584
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:54,240
So I have underwear that I can't even take a shit with.

585
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,240
It happens.

586
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:00,240
It happens even when I'm crying.

587
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,240
I can't get it.

588
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,240
I can't get it.

589
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,240
You can throw it away.

590
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,240
I can't throw it away.

591
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,240
Why?

592
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,240
I can't throw it away.

593
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,240
I can't throw it away.

594
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:18,240
I think everyone is living a great life.

595
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,240
I think everyone is living a great life.

596
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,240
You can say,

597
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,240
I don't care.

598
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,240
I don't care.

599
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,240
I don't care.

600
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,240
You can say that.

601
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,240
CQCQ.

602
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,240
You can say that.

603
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,240
I don't know.

604
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,240
I don't know.

605
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,240
You can say that.

606
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,240
When I get home, I'll wear this.

607
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,240
Why?

608
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,240
When I get home, I'll calm down.

609
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,240
When I get home, I'll calm down.

610
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,240
I'm really depressed.

611
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,240
There's nothing in the fridge.

612
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,240
There's nothing in the fridge.

613
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,240
You can't buy that.

614
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,240
You can't buy that.

615
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,240
Thank you for the meal.

616
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,240
That's what you say.

617
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,240
What did you eat?

618
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,240
Thank you for the meal.

619
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,240
It's like this.

620
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,240
I want you to laugh.

621
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,240
I want you to laugh.

622
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,240
I can't laugh.

623
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,240
I can't laugh.

624
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,240
I can't laugh.

625
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,240
I can't laugh.

626
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,240
I want you to give me a privilege.

627
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,240
I don't want to get caught in traffic.

628
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,240
I don't want to get caught in traffic.

629
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,240
I want you to let me go first.

630
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,240
I want you to let me go first.

631
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,240
Do you have a wife?

632
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,240
I can't go for them.

633
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,240
I can't go for them.

634
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,240
It's a poor family.

635
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,240
It's a poor family.

636
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,240
Get out of the way.

637
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,240
I'm going to get a lot of money.

638
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,240
I'm going to get a lot of money.

639
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:55,240
I'm going to make the audience go crazy.

640
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:59,240
Finally, the long-awaited Hama-chan's worst punishment game.

641
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:03,240
Instead of the usual postcard, we have a lot of questions from the talent.

642
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:07,240
I want the talent to answer the questions.

643
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,240
That's right.

644
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:11,240
It seems that they are asking us to do that.

645
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:13,240
Before that, let's have them come out for a moment.

646
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,240
What?

647
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,240
Please.

648
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:18,240
There is a guest who wants to come out no matter what.

649
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:21,240
Please come out.

650
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:25,240
It's Yuta Yoshiko.

651
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:37,240
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

652
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:41,240
When I passed the part A, my grandmother came out again.

653
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:46,240
Akiko is definitely behind this.

654
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,240
Thank you.

655
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:51,240
Thank you for calling me.

656
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:54,240
I didn't know at all. I didn't hear anything.

657
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:58,240
I'm getting hot when it's my turn.

658
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,240
Really?

659
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,240
It's hot, isn't it?

660
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,240
It's hot.

661
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:06,240
I have something I want to give you today.

662
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,240
It looks like a handkerchief, doesn't it?

663
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,240
Where is it?

664
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,240
I can see it.

665
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:17,240
I can see it right away, so please turn it over.

666
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:19,240
This is good.

667
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:21,240
This is good.

668
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:23,240
I don't need it anymore, so I'll give it to you.

669
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:30,240
It's 1993, so Mita-san doesn't wear it.

670
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,240
Is that so?

671
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:34,240
I think you were born in 1994.

672
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,240
I don't know that.

673
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,240
Is that so?

674
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,240
This is a gift.

675
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,240
I'll give it to you soon.

676
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,240
Thank you very much.

677
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,240
If you could give me a handkerchief.

678
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,240
That's right.

679
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,240
But you've made a lot of money this year, haven't you?

680
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,240
That's not true.

681
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:54,240
Did you drink so much that your head would explode?

682
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:57,240
I'm looking forward to it.

683
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,240
That's right.

684
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:01,240
That's all I'm looking forward to this year.

685
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:04,240
Mita-san, please give it to me as soon as possible.

686
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,240
That's right.

687
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,240
If I do that, I'll grow.

688
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,240
I won't be told anything again.

689
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,240
If you win first place, give me some money.

690
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,240
Why?

691
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:13,240
Why?

692
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:15,240
I won first place, so I don't need it.

693
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,240
No, no, no.

694
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,240
I'm also preparing to win the lottery.

695
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,240
That's great.

696
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,240
Please win the lottery.

697
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,240
Thank you very much.

698
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,240
Congratulations.

699
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:26,240
But Mita-san is making more money.

700
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,240
That's not true.

701
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:32,240
Mita-san has less money than us.

702
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,240
But she has a lot of money.

703
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,240
That's right.

704
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,240
That's right.

705
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,240
You're lying.

706
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:39,240
If you win this one, how much will you take?

707
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:41,240
That's a lot.

708
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,240
That's a lie.

709
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,240
That's why the set is like this.

710
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,240
That's right.

711
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:49,240
If you win this one, you'll probably have millions or tens of millions of yen.

712
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:52,240
If that's the case, I don't have anything to do.

713
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,240
No, no, no.

714
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:58,240
If we win here, we'll be in trouble.

715
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:01,240
It's different every time.

716
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:05,240
Today, I'm proud to win this.

717
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:10,240
I'm very proud.

718
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,240
I'll cut everything here.

719
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,240
Why?

720
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,240
What's the time for such a strange program?

721
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:24,240
It's great that I'm in between the two of you and I'm on the show.

722
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:27,240
That's great.

723
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:30,240
That's why at home, too.

724
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,240
What's this?

725
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,240
It's a kid's soap.

726
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,240
That's right.

727
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,240
I don't know.

728
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,240
Look, there's a kid.

729
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,240
I'm proud of myself.

730
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:42,240
Do you watch it with your child at home?

731
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,240
Yes, sometimes.

732
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,240
Is that so?

733
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,240
But...

734
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:50,240
What is it?

735
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,240
Aren't you a little bit tired?

736
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,240
I'm tired.

737
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:54,240
I'm not tired at all today.

738
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,240
Is that so?

739
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:58,240
Why?

740
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,240
You're very tired.

741
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,240
I'm always tired.

742
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,240
I'm very anxious.

743
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,240
Is that so?

744
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,240
I'm calm.

745
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,240
Is that so?

746
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:09,240
I'm sweating.

747
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:11,240
It's too hot.

748
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:13,240
You're sweating a lot today.

749
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:14,240
It's unusual.

750
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:17,240
It's hot.

751
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:19,240
Are you surprised?

752
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:20,240
I'm surprised.

753
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:25,240
I was talking about money in my head today.

754
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:28,240
It happened by chance.

755
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:30,240
I didn't say anything bad about me.

756
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:32,240
Really?

757
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:34,240
You're funny.

758
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:36,240
You're funny.

759
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,240
I was talking about money.

760
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:41,240
I was so surprised that I was surprised.

761
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:44,240
You were surprised to see me after I did something bad, right?

762
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:46,240
What?

763
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:48,240
You're not surprised at all.

764
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:50,240
Why are you fighting?

765
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:56,240
What are you talking about?

766
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:58,240
Are you going to do it?

767
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:00,240
You're very motivated.

768
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,240
Do something.

769
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,240
What are you talking about?

770
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:06,240
I'm here to do something.

771
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:08,240
You're like an amateur.

772
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:11,240
I was told to do something.

773
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:13,240
How old is your daughter?

774
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:14,240
I was surprised.

775
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:16,240
I thought you asked about my age.

776
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:22,240
What are you talking about?

777
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,240
How old is your daughter?

778
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:24,240
She's not my daughter.

779
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,240
Is she your daughter?

780
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,240
She's 20 years old.

781
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,240
She's 15 years old.

782
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,240
She's cute.

783
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,240
I didn't know that.

784
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:38,240
We went somewhere far away before.

785
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:41,240
We did it in the rain together.

786
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:42,240
We did it.

787
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,240
24 hours.

788
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:45,240
We said we would participate in that.

789
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:47,240
You said you wanted to see it.

790
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:48,240
That's what I said.

791
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,240
You're not very smart.

792
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,240
That's rude.

793
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:56,240
I quit.

794
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:58,240
We watched it together on TV.

795
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:01,240
We danced at that time.

796
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:04,240
I was surprised.

797
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:07,240
Why do you remember that?

798
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:09,240
That's right.

799
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:12,240
I was young at that time.

800
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,240
It was a few months ago.

801
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:15,240
Do you want to dance with me?

802
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:19,240
I'm weak.

803
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:23,240
Let's think of something new.

804
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:25,240
I'm really weak.

805
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:26,240
Really?

806
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,240
I can't dance.

807
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:30,240
This is a rare opportunity.

808
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:32,240
I can't use this.

809
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,240
I'm sorry.

810
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:37,240
Well...

811
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:39,240
Like this.

812
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:43,240
What is this?

813
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:45,240
What is this?

814
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:47,240
Like this?

815
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:50,240
You have to lower your waist.

816
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:51,240
I can't do this.

817
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:53,240
Why?

818
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:54,240
Like this?

819
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,240
Like this?

820
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:56,240
I can't.

821
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:59,240
You have to raise your nose.

822
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:01,240
This is different.

823
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:05,240
Let's stop.

824
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:07,240
I can't do this.

825
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:08,240
What is this?

826
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:09,240
Didn't you dance?

827
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:12,240
I like this.

828
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,240
I often do this.

829
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,240
What is this?

830
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:19,240
Why is your hand behind you?

831
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:21,240
Did you dance in the past?

832
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:23,240
I'm really weak.

833
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:25,240
I'm really weak.

834
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:28,240
Everyone is amazing.

835
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,240
The audience is amazing, too.

836
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:32,240
We dance together at the end.

837
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:34,240
You are great.

838
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:37,240
I want to dance with you.

839
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:38,240
Do you want to dance?

840
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:39,240
Yes.

841
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:41,240
I want to dance with you.

842
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:43,240
I'm lonely.

843
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:45,240
I want to dance with you.

844
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:52,240
Thank you very much.

845
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,240
What kind of dance did you do?

846
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,240
I didn't dance at all.

847
00:37:55,240 --> 00:38:05,240
Like this.

848
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:09,240
I can do that.

849
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:12,240
You are great.

850
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:15,240
I often did that.

851
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:16,240
Goodbye.

852
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:20,240
Thank you very much.

853
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:27,240
Thank you very much.

854
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:29,240
Everyone, the middle of the stage is empty.

855
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:31,240
I thought it was empty.

856
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:33,240
I bumped into the middle of the stage.

857
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:36,240
Don't say that.

858
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:43,240
I don't know what this is.

859
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:45,240
This is so funny.

860
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:53,240
I don't know what this is.

861
00:38:53,240 --> 00:39:13,240
I don't know what this is.

862
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:23,240
I don't know what this is.

863
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:33,240
I don't know what this is.

864
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:43,240
I'm tired.

865
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:50,240
I think you did a good job.

866
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:53,240
I thought you would win.

867
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:55,240
I thought so, too.

868
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:59,240
Do you read the flow of the times?

869
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:02,240
I didn't think that much.

870
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:05,240
Do you read the flow of the times?

871
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:09,240
I didn't think that much.

872
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:14,240
If you have any problems, please contact me.

873
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:17,240
I'll tell you the number of the office.

874
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:19,240
I'll tell you the number of the office.

875
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:20,240
Because my work is bad.

876
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:21,240
My work is bad.

877
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:27,240
I'll tell you the number of the office.

878
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:31,240
What's wrong?

879
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:34,240
I don't have a pen.

880
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:36,240
I can't write.

881
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,240
I don't have a pen.

882
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:38,240
I don't have a pen.

883
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:45,240
I can write.

884
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:46,240
I know.

885
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:54,240
I lent it to Sakamoto.

886
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:57,240
I don't have a pen.

887
00:40:57,240 --> 00:41:02,240
I want to take it.

888
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:05,240
I don't have a pen.

889
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:07,240
I went to New York.

890
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:11,240
I want to take a pen.

891
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:31,240
He is going to New York to take a pen.

892
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:42,240
He is going to New York to take a pen.

893
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:51,240
He is going to New York to take a pen.

894
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:53,240
What are you doing?

895
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:54,240
Do you have a day off today?

896
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,240
Yes.

897
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:57,240
I went to New York for a week.

898
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:59,240
I went to Bahama for a week.

899
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:00,240
What are you doing?

900
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:01,240
What are you doing?

901
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:03,240
It's a punishment game.

902
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:04,240
I heard that.

903
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:10,240
You know that, don't you?

904
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:13,240
It's not cool.

905
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:22,240
The trip to New York begins.

906
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:31,240
Where do you live?

907
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:37,240
Where do you live?

908
00:42:37,240 --> 00:43:02,240
I don't have a pen.

909
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:08,240
I want to take a pen.

910
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:10,240
I don't have a pen.

911
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:12,240
He can't do anything.

912
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:16,240
He arrives at JFK International Airport.

913
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:18,240
He is looking for a pen.

914
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:27,240
He arrives in America.

915
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:33,240
This is the worst.

916
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:36,240
He is in a hurry to go to his house in Sakamoto.

917
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:40,240
How many years have I been waiting for this?

918
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:50,240
Are you reading the flow of the world?

919
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:54,240
He finally arrives at the center of the world's economy and culture.

920
00:43:54,240 --> 00:44:02,240
He is looking for a house in Sakamoto.

921
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:10,240
I'm in a hurry.

922
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:13,240
Where are you going?

923
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:17,240
I'm in a hurry.

924
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:19,240
Where are you?

925
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:27,240
This is the Empire State Building, the symbol of Manhattan.

926
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:34,240
It's cold.

927
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:41,240
It's cold, but it's beautiful.

928
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:42,240
Let's take a picture.

929
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:47,240
A picture?

930
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:53,240
Why?

931
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:58,240
It's very cool.

932
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:06,240
In addition, he has a lot of coins that he doesn't want.

933
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:09,240
This is the last time.

934
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:13,240
Next time I want to go skating.

935
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:24,240
Rockfeller Center, a famous skating rink in New York.

936
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:26,240
He is in a hurry to go to his house in Sakamoto.

937
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:32,240
He is attracted to sightseeing.

938
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:35,240
Next is Times Square.

939
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:38,240
I have to go home.

940
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:40,240
You can go home tomorrow.

941
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:43,240
I don't have time.

942
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:48,240
I don't like hot dogs.

943
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:52,240
Let's eat.

944
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:56,240
This is not the time to eat hot dogs.

945
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:59,240
He is frustrated.

946
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:01,240
Hamada.

947
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:03,240
Don't take pictures of me.

948
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:09,240
Eat this.

949
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:14,240
This is the city where many artists live.

950
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:16,240
It's been 21 hours since he left Tokyo.

951
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:21,240
He finally arrives at the apartment where Ryuichi Sakamoto lives.

952
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:26,240
This is where I live.

953
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:30,240
I don't know.

954
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:34,240
It's been a while since I met Ryuichi Sakamoto.

955
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:44,240
Ryuichi Sakamoto.

956
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:46,240
Professor.

957
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:49,240
Thank you.

958
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:58,240
I forgot something.

959
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:02,240
What is that title?

960
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:05,240
What is that?

961
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:11,240
That's it.

962
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:13,240
He draws a line from the professor's hand.

963
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:15,240
This is a warm pen.

964
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:18,240
The first game is a success.

965
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:23,240
Hey, Sakamoto.

966
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:24,240
Ryuichi.

967
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:25,240
Let's go.

968
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:27,240
I don't have that attitude.

969
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:29,240
I have to go home.

970
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:33,240
I have to go home.

971
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:36,240
I'm not like you in Japan.

972
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:41,240
I'm not like you in Japan.

973
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:44,240
I'm a fighter.

974
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:46,240
It's cold.

975
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:47,240
You should go to the airport.

976
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:49,240
I have to go to the airport.

977
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:50,240
You're good.

978
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:52,240
I'm on a vacation.

979
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:55,240
You can say that at first.

980
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:59,240
That's it.

981
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:01,240
It's the worst.

982
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:06,240
See you later.

983
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:11,240
And Matsumoto goes to Japan.

984
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:13,240
The second time.

985
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:14,240
The second time.

986
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:15,240
The second time.

987
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:16,240
Did you do it once?

988
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:24,240
Yes.

989
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:25,240
You have to say it.

990
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:26,240
It's a meeting.

991
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:28,240
That's it.

992
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:29,240
Finally.

993
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:30,240
What's wrong?

994
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,240
You're like Matsumoto.

995
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:35,240
You always get in the way.

996
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:39,240
But now it's over.

997
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:40,240
It was very cold.

998
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:41,240
That's true.

999
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:47,240
It was cold at night.

1000
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:49,240
It's an eraser.

1001
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:51,240
What?

1002
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:55,640
Wait a minute. What are you talking about?

1003
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:59,140
I don't care. I want to bring it to you.

1004
00:48:59,140 --> 00:49:00,340
Wait a minute.

1005
00:49:00,340 --> 00:49:01,340
What is it?

1006
00:49:01,340 --> 00:49:02,340
It's Sakamoto-san's call.

1007
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:04,340
I don't care.

1008
00:49:04,340 --> 00:49:06,740
It's a bad game for what you said.

1009
00:49:06,740 --> 00:49:07,740
It's really annoying.

1010
00:49:07,740 --> 00:49:08,540
Hello?

1011
00:49:08,540 --> 00:49:10,040
Hello?

1012
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:10,840
Hello?

1013
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:11,540
Hello?

1014
00:49:11,540 --> 00:49:12,540
Are you in the classroom?

1015
00:49:12,540 --> 00:49:13,740
Yes.

1016
00:49:13,740 --> 00:49:14,740
Good morning.

1017
00:49:14,740 --> 00:49:15,240
Good morning.

1018
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:16,340
I'm Matsumoto.

1019
00:49:16,340 --> 00:49:17,340
Oh, hello.

1020
00:49:17,340 --> 00:49:18,140
Hello, hello.

1021
00:49:18,140 --> 00:49:20,140
I just realized.

1022
00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:23,140
I don't have an eraser.

1023
00:49:23,140 --> 00:49:26,140
Oh, you left it there.

1024
00:49:26,140 --> 00:49:27,140
No, I didn't.

1025
00:49:27,140 --> 00:49:27,640
You left it there.

1026
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:28,140
Do you have it?

1027
00:49:28,140 --> 00:49:30,640
No, I don't.

1028
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:32,140
I have it here.

1029
00:49:32,140 --> 00:49:37,140
Do you have it?

1030
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:42,140
I'll go get it.

1031
00:49:42,140 --> 00:49:52,140
Hama-chan is going to New York to get an eraser.

1032
00:49:52,140 --> 00:49:59,140
New York Manhattan, a nostalgic town, welcomes Hamada.

1033
00:49:59,140 --> 00:50:01,140
I want you to welcome me.

1034
00:50:01,140 --> 00:50:06,140
This is weird.

1035
00:50:06,140 --> 00:50:09,140
Stop, stop, stop.

1036
00:50:09,140 --> 00:50:12,140
Is that Suga-chan?

1037
00:50:12,140 --> 00:50:16,140
I don't want to go home.

1038
00:50:16,140 --> 00:50:21,140
I don't want to go home.

1039
00:50:21,140 --> 00:50:26,140
I don't want to go home.

1040
00:50:26,140 --> 00:50:33,140
I don't want to go home.

1041
00:50:33,140 --> 00:50:34,140
Hey!

1042
00:50:34,140 --> 00:50:37,140
Why are you here?

1043
00:50:37,140 --> 00:50:41,140
I'm going to get an eraser.

1044
00:50:41,140 --> 00:50:45,140
I'm going to get an eraser.

1045
00:50:45,140 --> 00:50:51,080
I'm going to the

1046
00:50:51,140 --> 00:50:55,140
Why are you hiding it?

1047
00:50:55,140 --> 00:50:57,140
I'm going to get an eraser.

1048
00:50:57,140 --> 00:50:59,140
I'm going to get an eraser.

1049
00:50:59,140 --> 00:51:02,140
The nostalgic reunion with producer Suga.

1050
00:51:02,140 --> 00:51:05,140
Times Square is here after two days.

1051
00:51:05,140 --> 00:51:07,140
Why are you here?

1052
00:51:07,140 --> 00:51:10,140
Why are you hiding it?

1053
00:51:10,140 --> 00:51:13,140
I'm going to get an eraser.

1054
00:51:13,140 --> 00:51:16,140
I don't want to go home.

1055
00:51:16,140 --> 00:51:18,140
I'm going to get an eraser.

1056
00:51:18,140 --> 00:51:22,140
I'm going to get an eraser.

1057
00:51:22,140 --> 00:51:24,140
I'm going to get an eraser.

1058
00:51:24,140 --> 00:51:27,140
It's been a while since I came to New York.

1059
00:51:27,140 --> 00:51:31,140
It's been a while.

1060
00:51:31,140 --> 00:51:35,140
It's not the time to eat anymore.

1061
00:51:35,140 --> 00:51:36,140
Hey.

1062
00:51:36,140 --> 00:51:37,140
What?

1063
00:51:37,140 --> 00:51:38,140
I want to shop.

1064
00:51:38,140 --> 00:51:39,140
Shopping?

1065
00:51:39,140 --> 00:51:43,140
I don't buy anything.

1066
00:51:43,140 --> 00:51:45,140
We should shop.

1067
00:51:45,140 --> 00:51:47,140
We should shop.

1068
00:51:47,140 --> 00:51:49,140
Why?

1069
00:51:49,140 --> 00:51:52,140
I want to shop.

1070
00:51:52,140 --> 00:51:54,140
New York's fifth district.

1071
00:51:54,140 --> 00:51:56,140
The world-class boutique shopping mall.

1072
00:51:56,140 --> 00:52:00,140
The world-class boutique shopping mall.

1073
00:52:00,140 --> 00:52:04,140
He's being dragged around again by Suga's interference.

1074
00:52:04,140 --> 00:52:07,140
And he's carrying a lot of luggage.

1075
00:52:07,140 --> 00:52:11,140
It's been two days since East Village.

1076
00:52:11,140 --> 00:52:14,140
It's been 59 hours since he left Japan for the first time.

1077
00:52:14,140 --> 00:52:18,140
The grand punishment game is finally coming to an end.

1078
00:52:18,140 --> 00:52:20,140
This is a punishment game, right?

1079
00:52:20,140 --> 00:52:22,140
I lost, so I don't know what to do.

1080
00:52:22,140 --> 00:52:23,140
What is this?

1081
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:25,140
This is annoying.

1082
00:52:25,140 --> 00:52:27,140
I don't know what to do.

1083
00:52:27,140 --> 00:52:30,140
It's so cold.

1084
00:52:30,140 --> 00:52:35,140
It's finally the reunion of Ryuichi Sakamoto and the 38th time in a row.

1085
00:52:35,140 --> 00:52:36,140
I'm done.

1086
00:52:44,140 --> 00:52:46,140
I'm tired.

1087
00:52:46,140 --> 00:52:48,140
Oh, it's 90 minutes.

1088
00:52:48,140 --> 00:52:52,140
I'm sorry.

1089
00:52:52,140 --> 00:52:54,140
You're late.

1090
00:52:54,140 --> 00:52:57,140
What do you mean I'm late?

1091
00:52:57,140 --> 00:52:59,140
Wait a minute.

1092
00:52:59,140 --> 00:53:01,140
I'm sorry.

1093
00:53:01,140 --> 00:53:02,140
Oh, I'm sorry.

1094
00:53:02,140 --> 00:53:04,140
Did you come here on purpose?

1095
00:53:04,140 --> 00:53:07,140
What are you doing?

1096
00:53:07,140 --> 00:53:09,140
He draws a line from the professor's hand.

1097
00:53:09,140 --> 00:53:12,140
The eraser is warmly handed to him.

1098
00:53:12,140 --> 00:53:14,140
The punishment game is complete.

1099
00:53:19,140 --> 00:53:21,140
I got the eraser.

1100
00:53:21,140 --> 00:53:24,140
This is what happens when you win the grand prize.

1101
00:53:24,140 --> 00:53:28,140
I'm going to write a song from tomorrow.

1102
00:53:28,140 --> 00:53:30,140
I'm going to challenge you.

1103
00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:34,140
I'm going to write a song and meet you at the grand prize venue.

1104
00:53:34,140 --> 00:53:37,140
See you.

1105
00:53:37,140 --> 00:53:41,140
And Matsumoto goes to Japan.

1106
00:53:41,140 --> 00:53:44,140
This is a pen.

1107
00:53:44,140 --> 00:53:48,140
I'm going to use this pen.

1108
00:53:48,140 --> 00:53:51,140
I'm going to use this pen.

1109
00:53:51,140 --> 00:53:54,140
This is the pen.

1110
00:53:54,140 --> 00:53:57,140
I'm going to use this pen.

1111
00:53:57,140 --> 00:54:00,140
You should have checked this pen from the beginning.

1112
00:54:00,140 --> 00:54:02,140
You should have checked this pen from the beginning.

1113
00:54:02,140 --> 00:54:03,140
I'm going to use this pen.

1114
00:54:06,140 --> 00:54:08,140
I don't need a pencil.

1115
00:54:08,140 --> 00:54:09,140
That's a pen, isn't it?

1116
00:54:09,140 --> 00:54:11,140
No, it's not this.

1117
00:54:12,140 --> 00:54:13,140
I'm sorry.

1118
00:54:16,140 --> 00:54:17,140
Go, go.

1119
00:54:19,140 --> 00:54:20,140
What?

1120
00:54:20,140 --> 00:54:22,140
I want to play Evian.

1121
00:54:24,140 --> 00:54:25,140
That's great!

1122
00:54:31,140 --> 00:54:33,140
It's been a long time, hasn't it?

1123
00:54:33,140 --> 00:54:35,140
We have to play Evian.

1124
00:54:35,140 --> 00:54:36,140
Why?

1125
00:54:36,140 --> 00:54:38,140
That's how the audience reacts.

1126
00:54:38,140 --> 00:54:40,140
You're going to play Evian again?

1127
00:54:40,140 --> 00:54:41,140
Come on!

1128
00:54:41,140 --> 00:54:43,140
It's hard to play in New York.

1129
00:54:43,140 --> 00:54:45,140
I heard it's really hard.

1130
00:54:45,140 --> 00:54:47,140
It's really, really hard.

1131
00:54:47,140 --> 00:54:48,140
I haven't slept much.

1132
00:54:48,140 --> 00:54:49,140
You haven't slept?

1133
00:54:49,140 --> 00:54:50,140
It's daytime!

1134
00:54:50,140 --> 00:54:54,140
Well, I've done something similar to that.

1135
00:54:54,140 --> 00:54:55,140
What is it?

1136
00:54:55,140 --> 00:54:56,140
No, no, no.

1137
00:54:56,140 --> 00:54:57,140
What is it?

1138
00:54:57,140 --> 00:55:00,140
Your punishment has already been decided.

1139
00:55:00,140 --> 00:55:01,140
Oh, really?

1140
00:55:01,140 --> 00:55:02,140
What is it?

1141
00:55:02,140 --> 00:55:09,140
Go to the North Pole and become a cool mint gum.

1142
00:55:11,140 --> 00:55:12,140
A penguin?

1143
00:55:14,140 --> 00:55:17,140
I'll sell it after I get off the plane.

1144
00:55:18,140 --> 00:55:19,140
You'll sell it?

1145
00:55:19,140 --> 00:55:21,140
It's a limited production.

1146
00:55:21,140 --> 00:55:24,140
When we were on the plane,

1147
00:55:24,140 --> 00:55:27,140
Mr. Abe was sitting in the back.

1148
00:55:27,140 --> 00:55:29,140
The woman said,

1149
00:55:29,140 --> 00:55:32,140
Please sign it.

1150
00:55:32,140 --> 00:55:33,140
It's okay.

1151
00:55:33,140 --> 00:55:34,140
It's a long trip.

1152
00:55:34,140 --> 00:55:37,140
I'll take it off now, so please wait a minute.

1153
00:55:37,140 --> 00:55:38,140
I said, what?

1154
00:55:38,140 --> 00:55:40,140
She took off her bra.

1155
00:55:40,140 --> 00:55:42,140
In the plane.

1156
00:55:42,140 --> 00:55:44,140
She took off her bra and said,

1157
00:55:44,140 --> 00:55:45,140
Here you go.

1158
00:55:46,140 --> 00:55:47,140
She's crazy.

1159
00:55:47,140 --> 00:55:49,140
It's really warm.

1160
00:55:51,140 --> 00:55:53,140
I signed another bra.

1161
00:55:56,140 --> 00:55:57,140
Don't smell it.

1162
00:55:57,140 --> 00:55:58,140
I see.

1163
00:55:59,140 --> 00:56:03,140
I didn't eat anything on the way home.

1164
00:56:03,140 --> 00:56:04,140
I was so tired.

1165
00:56:04,140 --> 00:56:05,140
You couldn't eat?

1166
00:56:05,140 --> 00:56:07,140
I didn't care about the in-flight meal.

1167
00:56:07,140 --> 00:56:08,140
I wanted to sleep.

1168
00:56:08,140 --> 00:56:10,140
I slept for a long time.

1169
00:56:10,140 --> 00:56:12,140
In the second half of the flight,

1170
00:56:12,140 --> 00:56:15,140
There was a foreign man with a bad Japanese.

1171
00:56:15,140 --> 00:56:16,140
He came to me and said,

1172
00:56:16,140 --> 00:56:18,140
You didn't eat anything, did you?

1173
00:56:18,140 --> 00:56:19,140
I said yes.

1174
00:56:21,140 --> 00:56:24,140
If you don't eat anything on your way home from abroad,

1175
00:56:24,140 --> 00:56:27,140
You can be mistaken for a drug carrier.

1176
00:56:32,140 --> 00:56:34,140
I said, I didn't eat anything.

1177
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:36,140
I went home and left.

1178
00:56:36,140 --> 00:56:38,140
If I ate something, it would be digested.

1179
00:56:38,140 --> 00:56:40,140
All the medicine would go wrong.

1180
00:56:40,140 --> 00:56:43,140
I put some medicine in a plastic bag and drank it.

1181
00:56:43,140 --> 00:56:46,140
Then I went back to Japan.

1182
00:56:46,140 --> 00:56:48,140
I didn't eat anything.

1183
00:56:48,140 --> 00:56:50,140
I was sleeping all the time.

1184
00:56:50,140 --> 00:56:52,140
The other foreigners

1185
00:56:52,140 --> 00:56:56,140
looked at me like this to pass me by.

1186
00:56:56,140 --> 00:56:57,140
That person said,

1187
00:56:57,140 --> 00:56:59,140
You didn't eat anything, did you?

1188
00:56:59,140 --> 00:57:00,140
Of course I did.

1189
00:57:01,140 --> 00:57:04,140
But I carried it.

1190
00:57:10,140 --> 00:57:12,140
Let's ask questions.

1191
00:57:12,140 --> 00:57:13,140
Really?

1192
00:57:13,140 --> 00:57:14,140
Let's do it.

1193
00:57:17,140 --> 00:57:20,140
How are you, Hama-chan and Mach-chan in downtown?

1194
00:57:20,140 --> 00:57:22,140
It's been a long time.

1195
00:57:22,140 --> 00:57:25,140
I always enjoy watching this program.

1196
00:57:25,140 --> 00:57:28,140
I'm one of the fans of this program.

1197
00:57:28,140 --> 00:57:33,140
I want you to continue to do this program for a long time.

1198
00:57:36,140 --> 00:57:38,140
When you touch something,

1199
00:57:38,140 --> 00:57:41,140
There is a static electricity that flashes.

1200
00:57:41,140 --> 00:57:46,140
I've been wondering how to prevent that static electricity.

1201
00:57:46,140 --> 00:57:50,140
I want to prevent it.

1202
00:57:50,140 --> 00:57:52,140
How can I do it?

1203
00:57:52,140 --> 00:57:54,140
Why are you acting like a fool?

1204
00:58:00,140 --> 00:58:02,140
Do you always do this?

1205
00:58:02,140 --> 00:58:04,140
I can't prevent it.

1206
00:58:04,140 --> 00:58:06,140
It's the logic of putting a lid on something that stinks.

1207
00:58:06,140 --> 00:58:08,140
Stop it, you idiot.

1208
00:58:08,140 --> 00:58:10,140
But I can't do it right away.

1209
00:58:10,140 --> 00:58:12,140
You can't do it, but you can do it right away.

1210
00:58:12,140 --> 00:58:17,140
No, I can't do it right away.

1211
00:58:17,140 --> 00:58:20,140
I'm sorry for hitting you.

1212
00:58:20,140 --> 00:58:22,140
It's too nostalgic.

1213
00:58:22,140 --> 00:58:25,140
What does static electricity taste like?

1214
00:58:25,140 --> 00:58:27,140
It's a quiet electricity.

1215
00:58:27,140 --> 00:58:28,140
Really?

1216
00:58:28,140 --> 00:58:31,140
You didn't know that, did you?

1217
00:58:31,140 --> 00:58:33,140
I knew it, you idiot.

1218
00:58:33,140 --> 00:58:35,140
Don't say yes now.

1219
00:58:35,140 --> 00:58:36,140
Say yes.

1220
00:58:36,140 --> 00:58:37,140
Are you ready?

1221
00:58:37,140 --> 00:58:39,140
Static heat.

1222
00:58:39,140 --> 00:58:40,140
Yes.

1223
00:58:40,140 --> 00:58:42,140
Then what is yes?

1224
00:58:42,140 --> 00:58:43,140
Static heat.

1225
00:58:43,140 --> 00:58:44,140
Yes.

1226
00:58:45,140 --> 00:58:46,140
Say it.

1227
00:58:50,140 --> 00:58:52,140
No.1 static heat.

1228
00:58:52,140 --> 00:58:54,140
I'll sing it as hard as I can.

1229
00:58:54,140 --> 00:58:56,140
No.1 static heat.

1230
00:58:57,140 --> 00:58:58,140
Yutemi.

1231
00:58:58,140 --> 00:58:59,140
Yes.

1232
00:59:05,140 --> 00:59:07,140
Say it. Static heat.

1233
00:59:07,140 --> 00:59:08,140
Static heat.

1234
00:59:08,140 --> 00:59:09,140
Static heat.

1235
00:59:09,140 --> 00:59:12,140
This is the culprit of static electricity.

1236
00:59:12,140 --> 00:59:15,140
By preventing this static heat,

1237
00:59:15,140 --> 00:59:19,140
we can get rid of static electricity from this world.

1238
00:59:20,140 --> 00:59:21,140
Yes, yes, yes.

1239
00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:22,140
Are you ready?

1240
00:59:22,140 --> 00:59:23,140
Try walking.

1241
00:59:25,140 --> 00:59:27,140
You should be able to walk.

1242
00:59:27,140 --> 00:59:31,140
You should be able to walk.

1243
00:59:35,140 --> 00:59:36,140
Now,

1244
00:59:36,140 --> 00:59:39,140
there is a way to avoid static heat.

1245
00:59:39,140 --> 00:59:42,140
There is a way to avoid static heat.

1246
00:59:42,140 --> 00:59:43,140
Please tell me.

1247
00:59:43,140 --> 00:59:45,140
That's it. You know it, right?

1248
00:59:45,140 --> 00:59:47,140
If I walk like that?

1249
00:59:47,140 --> 00:59:49,140
If you walk like this,

1250
00:59:49,140 --> 00:59:51,140
it might be fun.

1251
00:59:52,140 --> 00:59:55,140
No one walks like that.

1252
00:59:55,140 --> 00:59:57,140
You might look like an idiot.

1253
00:59:57,140 --> 00:59:58,140
No, I don't.

1254
00:59:58,140 --> 00:59:59,140
But,

1255
01:00:00,140 --> 01:00:02,140
there is a lot of static electricity.

1256
01:00:02,140 --> 01:00:03,140
Yes, yes.

1257
01:00:03,140 --> 01:00:05,140
You have to do something about it.

1258
01:00:05,140 --> 01:00:06,140
Is there a way to walk?

1259
01:00:06,140 --> 01:00:08,140
Walk without touching the floor.

1260
01:00:08,140 --> 01:00:09,140
What?

1261
01:00:09,140 --> 01:00:10,140
Yes, yes, yes.

1262
01:00:11,140 --> 01:00:12,140
Come here.

1263
01:00:13,140 --> 01:00:14,140
There are sweets, too.

1264
01:00:17,140 --> 01:00:18,140
I don't know.

1265
01:00:18,140 --> 01:00:20,140
Walk without touching the floor.

1266
01:00:20,140 --> 01:00:25,140
Walk without touching the floor.

1267
01:00:27,140 --> 01:00:29,140
You look like an idiot.

1268
01:00:30,140 --> 01:00:31,140
You are an idiot.

1269
01:00:33,140 --> 01:00:36,140
Walk without touching the floor.

1270
01:00:36,140 --> 01:00:37,140
Are you ready?

1271
01:00:43,140 --> 01:00:44,140
What is this?

1272
01:00:45,140 --> 01:00:46,140
This has nothing to do with it.

1273
01:00:46,140 --> 01:00:48,140
You can't walk without touching the floor.

1274
01:00:48,140 --> 01:00:49,140
What?

1275
01:00:49,140 --> 01:00:50,140
You can't walk without touching the floor.

1276
01:00:51,140 --> 01:00:52,140
I can't walk without touching the floor?

1277
01:00:52,140 --> 01:00:53,140
What do you mean?

1278
01:00:54,140 --> 01:00:56,140
Do you mean the same movement?

1279
01:00:56,140 --> 01:00:57,140
Yes, yes.

1280
01:01:00,140 --> 01:01:01,140
If you do this,

1281
01:01:02,140 --> 01:01:04,140
static electricity will never be generated.

1282
01:01:05,140 --> 01:01:06,140
You can't hurry.

1283
01:01:06,140 --> 01:01:07,140
Yes.

1284
01:01:07,140 --> 01:01:09,140
But you don't like walking like this.

1285
01:01:10,140 --> 01:01:11,140
So, let's stop.

1286
01:01:11,140 --> 01:01:15,140
Are you going to stop?

1287
01:01:15,140 --> 01:01:33,140
Up to this point, we have introduced the products of trust, Tiger Magic, Asahi Beer, Noelia, Nipro, Lion Po, and our sponsor in Tokyo.

1288
01:01:37,140 --> 01:01:38,140
Let's go to the next one.

1289
01:01:41,140 --> 01:01:43,140
Hello, everyone in downtown Tokyo.

1290
01:01:43,140 --> 01:01:44,140
Long time no see.

1291
01:01:44,140 --> 01:01:45,140
I'm Koike from Kenjunkai.

1292
01:01:46,140 --> 01:01:50,140
There are a lot of problems with various countries around Japan.

1293
01:01:50,140 --> 01:01:54,140
There is a problem with Japan-US trade and China.

1294
01:01:54,140 --> 01:01:58,140
There is also a problem with refugees in Africa.

1295
01:01:58,140 --> 01:02:02,140
The hottest topic in Japan right now is KEDO.

1296
01:02:02,140 --> 01:02:07,140
Let me hear your thoughts on KEDO.

1297
01:02:07,140 --> 01:02:08,140
What is KEDO?

1298
01:02:11,140 --> 01:02:12,140
KEDO.

1299
01:02:12,140 --> 01:02:14,140
K-E-D-O.

1300
01:02:17,140 --> 01:02:18,140
Do you know what it is?

1301
01:02:19,140 --> 01:02:21,140
Do you know what it is?

1302
01:02:21,140 --> 01:02:22,140
It's a Chinese character.

1303
01:02:24,140 --> 01:02:25,140
No, no.

1304
01:02:25,140 --> 01:02:26,140
What is it?

1305
01:02:26,140 --> 01:02:27,140
It's a story about me.

1306
01:02:29,140 --> 01:02:30,140
It's a Chinese character.

1307
01:02:30,140 --> 01:02:31,140
That's right. It's KEDO.

1308
01:02:34,140 --> 01:02:36,140
What does KEDO mean?

1309
01:02:38,140 --> 01:02:39,140
You are a fool.

1310
01:02:39,140 --> 01:02:42,140
Why don't you cut off your nipples?

1311
01:02:43,140 --> 01:02:44,140
Cut off my nipples?

1312
01:02:45,140 --> 01:02:48,140
I have to do a lot of things.

1313
01:02:48,140 --> 01:02:49,140
That's right.

1314
01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:50,140
Do you know KEDO?

1315
01:02:50,140 --> 01:02:51,140
Yes.

1316
01:02:51,140 --> 01:02:52,140
Is that so?

1317
01:02:52,140 --> 01:02:53,140
Yes.

1318
01:02:53,140 --> 01:02:54,140
OZONSO.

1319
01:02:54,140 --> 01:02:55,140
Again?

1320
01:02:55,140 --> 01:02:56,140
What did you write?

1321
01:02:59,140 --> 01:03:00,140
What is OZONSO?

1322
01:03:01,140 --> 01:03:02,140
What is it?

1323
01:03:02,140 --> 01:03:03,140
I'm asking you.

1324
01:03:05,140 --> 01:03:07,140
I don't know. Please tell me.

1325
01:03:07,140 --> 01:03:09,140
OZONSO is...

1326
01:03:12,140 --> 01:03:13,140
Please leave.

1327
01:03:14,140 --> 01:03:15,140
It's nothing to do with OZONSO.

1328
01:03:15,140 --> 01:03:16,140
It's nothing?

1329
01:03:17,140 --> 01:03:18,140
It's nothing?

1330
01:03:18,140 --> 01:03:19,140
Yes.

1331
01:03:19,140 --> 01:03:20,140
What are you thinking?

1332
01:03:20,140 --> 01:03:21,140
What?

1333
01:03:21,140 --> 01:03:22,140
At that time.

1334
01:03:24,140 --> 01:03:25,140
Why are you angry at me now?

1335
01:03:27,140 --> 01:03:28,140
It's KEDO.

1336
01:03:28,140 --> 01:03:30,140
I'm talking about KEDO.

1337
01:03:30,140 --> 01:03:31,140
Please tell me.

1338
01:03:31,140 --> 01:03:32,140
I know.

1339
01:03:32,140 --> 01:03:33,140
You.

1340
01:03:33,140 --> 01:03:34,140
Yes.

1341
01:03:34,140 --> 01:03:36,140
You shouldn't do that.

1342
01:03:36,140 --> 01:03:37,140
You.

1343
01:03:37,140 --> 01:03:38,140
Yes.

1344
01:03:43,140 --> 01:03:45,140
Don't do that weird thing.

1345
01:03:46,140 --> 01:03:47,140
It's KEDO.

1346
01:03:47,140 --> 01:03:48,140
KEDO.

1347
01:03:49,140 --> 01:03:52,140
Everyone can do this.

1348
01:03:52,140 --> 01:03:53,140
KEDO.

1349
01:03:53,140 --> 01:03:54,140
If you think about it, you'll understand.

1350
01:03:54,140 --> 01:03:55,140
Do you understand?

1351
01:03:55,140 --> 01:03:56,140
I don't know.

1352
01:03:56,140 --> 01:03:58,140
What does K stand for?

1353
01:03:58,140 --> 01:03:59,140
That's what I'm asking you.

1354
01:03:59,140 --> 01:04:00,140
What is it?

1355
01:04:00,140 --> 01:04:07,140
North America.

1356
01:04:07,140 --> 01:04:10,140
Are you okay?

1357
01:04:10,140 --> 01:04:12,140
It's okay.

1358
01:04:12,140 --> 01:04:13,140
It's okay.

1359
01:04:13,140 --> 01:04:18,140
England.

1360
01:04:18,140 --> 01:04:21,140
Are you okay?

1361
01:04:21,140 --> 01:04:23,140
What is D?

1362
01:04:23,140 --> 01:04:26,140
Germany.

1363
01:04:26,140 --> 01:04:28,140
I know.

1364
01:04:28,140 --> 01:04:30,140
It's Germany.

1365
01:04:30,140 --> 01:04:31,140
Leave it to me.

1366
01:04:31,140 --> 01:04:33,140
Okay.

1367
01:04:33,140 --> 01:04:35,140
The last one.

1368
01:04:35,140 --> 01:04:41,140
Australia.

1369
01:04:41,140 --> 01:04:44,140
It's Australia.

1370
01:04:44,140 --> 01:04:46,140
Okay.

1371
01:04:46,140 --> 01:04:49,140
Okay.

1372
01:04:49,140 --> 01:04:51,140
Giraffe.

1373
01:04:51,140 --> 01:04:55,140
Why did you say giraffe?

1374
01:04:55,140 --> 01:04:56,140
Giraffe.

1375
01:04:56,140 --> 01:04:57,140
Yes.

1376
01:04:57,140 --> 01:04:58,140
What is E?

1377
01:04:58,140 --> 01:05:01,140
It's a dolphin.

1378
01:05:01,140 --> 01:05:02,140
That's good.

1379
01:05:02,140 --> 01:05:04,140
I'm starting to understand.

1380
01:05:04,140 --> 01:05:05,140
What is D?

1381
01:05:05,140 --> 01:05:07,140
It's a dog.

1382
01:05:07,140 --> 01:05:08,140
It's a dog.

1383
01:05:08,140 --> 01:05:10,140
That's all you can say?

1384
01:05:10,140 --> 01:05:11,140
Wait a minute.

1385
01:05:11,140 --> 01:05:12,140
Everyone, be quiet.

1386
01:05:12,140 --> 01:05:13,140
Everyone, be quiet.

1387
01:05:13,140 --> 01:05:14,140
Wait a minute.

1388
01:05:14,140 --> 01:05:16,140
I have something I want to ask you all.

1389
01:05:16,140 --> 01:05:18,140
What is CHOKODAKE?

1390
01:05:18,140 --> 01:05:19,140
What?

1391
01:05:19,140 --> 01:05:21,140
Is CHOKODAKE English?

1392
01:05:21,140 --> 01:05:23,140
I didn't say that.

1393
01:05:23,140 --> 01:05:25,140
I didn't say CHOKODAKE.

1394
01:05:25,140 --> 01:05:27,140
I didn't say CHOKODAKE.

1395
01:05:27,140 --> 01:05:30,140
I didn't say that.

1396
01:05:30,140 --> 01:05:31,140
What?

1397
01:05:31,140 --> 01:05:32,140
K is a giraffe, right?

1398
01:05:32,140 --> 01:05:33,140
K is a giraffe.

1399
01:05:33,140 --> 01:05:34,140
E is a dolphin, right?

1400
01:05:34,140 --> 01:05:37,140
It's a dolphin.

1401
01:05:37,140 --> 01:05:38,140
I'm starting to understand.

1402
01:05:38,140 --> 01:05:39,140
What is D?

1403
01:05:39,140 --> 01:05:40,140
It's a dog.

1404
01:05:40,140 --> 01:05:41,140
That's all you can say?

1405
01:05:41,140 --> 01:05:43,140
That's right.

1406
01:05:43,140 --> 01:05:44,140
The last one is O.

1407
01:05:44,140 --> 01:05:46,140
That's right.

1408
01:05:46,140 --> 01:05:48,140
It's OCHI.

1409
01:05:48,140 --> 01:05:49,140
It's O.

1410
01:05:49,140 --> 01:05:51,140
Leave it to me.

1411
01:05:51,140 --> 01:05:52,140
What is O?

1412
01:05:52,140 --> 01:05:54,140
Australia.

1413
01:05:54,140 --> 01:05:55,140
Australia.

1414
01:05:55,140 --> 01:05:58,140
I wanted to do that first.

1415
01:05:58,140 --> 01:06:01,140
You had to do it before that.

1416
01:06:01,140 --> 01:06:02,140
All right.

1417
01:06:02,140 --> 01:06:03,140
Let's do it properly.

1418
01:06:03,140 --> 01:06:04,140
Let's do it properly.

1419
01:06:04,140 --> 01:06:09,140
Let's do it properly.

1420
01:06:09,140 --> 01:06:14,140
The cake is bad.

1421
01:06:14,140 --> 01:06:17,140
It's like a line.

1422
01:06:17,140 --> 01:06:19,140
K is.

1423
01:06:19,140 --> 01:06:21,140
The cake is bad.

1424
01:06:21,140 --> 01:06:23,140
Nice.

1425
01:06:23,140 --> 01:06:25,140
It's better than I thought!

1426
01:06:25,140 --> 01:06:27,140
That's good.

1427
01:06:27,140 --> 01:06:28,640
D.

1428
01:06:28,640 --> 01:06:30,140
What's going on?

1429
01:06:30,140 --> 01:06:32,140
That's good.

1430
01:06:32,140 --> 01:06:34,140
O.

1431
01:06:34,140 --> 01:06:36,140
O?

1432
01:06:38,140 --> 01:06:40,140
You're always wrong.

1433
01:06:40,140 --> 01:06:42,140
You can't even write it.

1434
01:06:42,140 --> 01:06:44,140
But I don't know Hamada-kun.

1435
01:06:44,140 --> 01:06:46,140
Jimin, Jimin.

1436
01:06:46,140 --> 01:06:47,140
Stop it.

1437
01:06:47,140 --> 01:06:54,140
Even if you ask me a lot, I don't know.

1438
01:06:54,140 --> 01:06:55,140
That's enough.

1439
01:06:55,140 --> 01:06:57,140
Let's go to the next one.

1440
01:06:59,140 --> 01:07:00,140
Good evening.

1441
01:07:00,140 --> 01:07:02,140
I'm Azuma Chizuru.

1442
01:07:02,140 --> 01:07:03,140
I have hay fever.

1443
01:07:03,140 --> 01:07:04,140
I'm having a hard time today.

1444
01:07:04,140 --> 01:07:11,140
Recently, I've become an adult woman.

1445
01:07:11,140 --> 01:07:14,140
I've been calling myself an adult for a long time.

1446
01:07:14,140 --> 01:07:19,140
When do you think of me as an old woman?

1447
01:07:19,140 --> 01:07:24,140
When do you think of me as an old woman?

1448
01:07:24,140 --> 01:07:28,140
I think of you as an old man.

1449
01:07:28,140 --> 01:07:29,140
See you later.

1450
01:07:29,140 --> 01:07:31,140
What are you talking about?

1451
01:07:31,140 --> 01:07:35,140
When do you think of me as an old woman?

1452
01:07:35,140 --> 01:07:39,140
Men go through a certain stage.

1453
01:07:39,140 --> 01:07:41,140
Little by little.

1454
01:07:41,140 --> 01:07:44,140
It comes suddenly.

1455
01:07:44,140 --> 01:07:45,140
At once.

1456
01:07:45,140 --> 01:07:48,140
It was normal until last week's Friday.

1457
01:07:48,140 --> 01:07:51,140
There was something like that.

1458
01:07:51,140 --> 01:07:52,140
Is that so?

1459
01:07:52,140 --> 01:07:56,140
What do you think of me as an adult woman?

1460
01:07:56,140 --> 01:07:59,140
When do you think of me as an adult woman?

1461
01:07:59,140 --> 01:08:02,140
What is that?

1462
01:08:02,140 --> 01:08:05,140
This is okay.

1463
01:08:05,140 --> 01:08:07,140
Why is it okay?

1464
01:08:07,140 --> 01:08:09,140
Why is it okay?

1465
01:08:09,140 --> 01:08:16,140
It's starting to smell.

1466
01:08:16,140 --> 01:08:17,140
What is that?

1467
01:08:17,140 --> 01:08:18,140
Does it smell?

1468
01:08:18,140 --> 01:08:20,140
When you get older, it starts to smell.

1469
01:08:20,140 --> 01:08:22,140
I'm 35 years old.

1470
01:08:22,140 --> 01:08:24,140
This is strange.

1471
01:08:24,140 --> 01:08:26,140
What does it smell like?

1472
01:08:26,140 --> 01:08:28,140
It smells like an animal.

1473
01:08:28,140 --> 01:08:30,140
That's the same as before.

1474
01:08:30,140 --> 01:08:31,140
That's right.

1475
01:08:31,140 --> 01:08:34,140
It always smells like an animal.

1476
01:08:34,140 --> 01:08:38,140
I'm really okay.

1477
01:08:38,140 --> 01:08:41,140
My body doesn't smell.

1478
01:08:41,140 --> 01:08:42,140
What?

1479
01:08:42,140 --> 01:08:49,140
Do you have a lot of curry powder?

1480
01:08:49,140 --> 01:08:52,140
What are you talking about?

1481
01:08:52,140 --> 01:08:54,140
It smells here and here.

1482
01:08:54,140 --> 01:08:55,140
Your back smells.

1483
01:08:55,140 --> 01:08:56,140
Why?

1484
01:08:56,140 --> 01:08:57,140
Wait a minute.

1485
01:08:57,140 --> 01:08:58,140
You can't say that.

1486
01:08:58,140 --> 01:08:59,140
Your back smells.

1487
01:08:59,140 --> 01:09:01,140
Your back doesn't smell like that.

1488
01:09:01,140 --> 01:09:05,140
It smells like an elephant.

1489
01:09:05,140 --> 01:09:08,140
What kind of smell is that?

1490
01:09:08,140 --> 01:09:10,140
My legs don't smell.

1491
01:09:10,140 --> 01:09:12,140
My armpits don't smell.

1492
01:09:12,140 --> 01:09:16,140
I don't smell at all.

1493
01:09:16,140 --> 01:09:20,140
It feels good.

1494
01:09:20,140 --> 01:09:22,140
I feel the same way.

1495
01:09:22,140 --> 01:09:23,140
I feel better.

1496
01:09:23,140 --> 01:09:26,140
I feel better.

1497
01:09:26,140 --> 01:09:27,140
I don't know.

1498
01:09:27,140 --> 01:09:31,140
I feel better.

1499
01:09:31,140 --> 01:09:32,140
I don't know.

1500
01:09:32,140 --> 01:09:34,140
I don't feel good.

1501
01:09:34,140 --> 01:09:36,140
I feel really good right now.

1502
01:09:36,140 --> 01:09:44,140
I feel really good right now.

1503
01:09:44,140 --> 01:09:49,140
I know.

1504
01:09:49,140 --> 01:09:50,140
The adventure of Matsumoto.

1505
01:09:50,140 --> 01:09:55,140
Explosive explosion.

1506
01:09:55,140 --> 01:09:57,140
One day in March.

1507
01:09:57,140 --> 01:10:03,140
Hamada and the staff were called to Matsumoto.

1508
01:10:03,140 --> 01:10:10,140
At that time, they hadn't heard Matsumoto's decision yet.

1509
01:10:10,140 --> 01:10:13,140
He told us to come here.

1510
01:10:13,140 --> 01:10:16,140
He came early in the morning.

1511
01:10:16,140 --> 01:10:17,140
He came.

1512
01:10:17,140 --> 01:10:19,140
Matsumoto came there.

1513
01:10:19,140 --> 01:10:22,140
He made me feel like I was missing him.

1514
01:10:22,140 --> 01:10:23,140
Everyone's here.

1515
01:10:23,140 --> 01:10:24,140
Everyone's here.

1516
01:10:24,140 --> 01:10:30,140
What?

1517
01:10:30,140 --> 01:10:33,140
There's no water.

1518
01:10:33,140 --> 01:10:35,140
What?

1519
01:10:35,140 --> 01:10:36,140
It's cold.

1520
01:10:36,140 --> 01:10:38,140
What's wrong?

1521
01:10:38,140 --> 01:10:42,140
I'm sorry to say this in front of you.

1522
01:10:42,140 --> 01:10:49,140
Recently, I feel like I'm very lazy.

1523
01:10:49,140 --> 01:10:52,140
That's in front of you.

1524
01:10:52,140 --> 01:10:55,140
I'm not inspired at all.

1525
01:10:55,140 --> 01:10:57,140
Inspired.

1526
01:10:57,140 --> 01:10:58,140
What do you mean?

1527
01:10:58,140 --> 01:11:02,140
Of course, that's what I mean.

1528
01:11:02,140 --> 01:11:14,140
I think it's very bad because it's becoming a very raw Matsumoto.

1529
01:11:14,140 --> 01:11:20,140
In the old days, I think it was more like a state of emergency.

1530
01:11:20,140 --> 01:11:23,140
I think it's coming to an end.

1531
01:11:23,140 --> 01:11:30,140
I think it's very dangerous.

1532
01:11:30,140 --> 01:11:33,140
I'm going to do some action.

1533
01:11:33,140 --> 01:11:35,140
I'm going to do some action.

1534
01:11:35,140 --> 01:11:38,140
I want you to see it.

1535
01:11:38,140 --> 01:11:40,140
It's different.

1536
01:11:40,140 --> 01:11:42,140
He's different.

1537
01:11:42,140 --> 01:11:44,140
Minotake is different.

1538
01:11:44,140 --> 01:11:46,140
Minotake is different.

1539
01:11:46,140 --> 01:11:48,140
That's what I want you to think.

1540
01:11:48,140 --> 01:11:50,140
Let me explain the situation.

1541
01:11:50,140 --> 01:11:52,140
I have a car ready.

1542
01:11:52,140 --> 01:11:55,140
I'm going to get in there.

1543
01:11:55,140 --> 01:11:58,140
I think you can see the helicopter on the side.

1544
01:11:58,140 --> 01:12:03,140
I'm going to pull up that car with that.

1545
01:12:03,140 --> 01:12:06,140
I'm going to go to a pretty high height.

1546
01:12:06,140 --> 01:12:08,140
I can't do anything with that alone.

1547
01:12:08,140 --> 01:12:10,140
I don't like it.

1548
01:12:10,140 --> 01:12:16,140
So I'm going to lift it up from the helicopter and drop it down.

1549
01:12:16,140 --> 01:12:19,140
I'm going to knock down the car.

1550
01:12:19,140 --> 01:12:22,140
It's still hard to do that alone.

1551
01:12:22,140 --> 01:12:26,140
As you can see over there, I have a tank ready.

1552
01:12:26,140 --> 01:12:31,140
I want you to thank me.

1553
01:12:31,140 --> 01:12:37,140
I think I'm going to be beaten up pretty hard.

1554
01:12:37,140 --> 01:12:42,140
But I don't think that's enough.

1555
01:12:42,140 --> 01:12:45,140
That's me.

1556
01:12:45,140 --> 01:12:49,140
That's what I've been thinking since the other day.

1557
01:12:49,140 --> 01:12:54,140
I want you to know that Matsumoto is crazy.

1558
01:12:54,140 --> 01:13:00,140
By doing that, my sleeping man instinct...

1559
01:13:00,140 --> 01:13:03,140
Your sleeping man instinct?

1560
01:13:03,140 --> 01:13:07,140
That's ridiculous!

1561
01:13:07,140 --> 01:13:10,140
What's the point of this?

1562
01:13:10,140 --> 01:13:13,140
You can watch it.

1563
01:13:13,140 --> 01:13:16,140
Are you stupid?

1564
01:13:16,140 --> 01:13:19,140
Which university did you go to?

1565
01:13:19,140 --> 01:13:21,140
I went to Kyoto.

1566
01:13:21,140 --> 01:13:24,140
I don't know.

1567
01:13:24,140 --> 01:13:26,140
He is Matsumoto Hitoshi.

1568
01:13:26,140 --> 01:13:32,140
He is a man who has overcome many obstacles as a weak 31 year old.

1569
01:13:32,140 --> 01:13:36,140
His trained body and sharpened mental strength...

1570
01:13:36,140 --> 01:13:41,140
It's only when you're in a state of extreme smoke that you're 100% sure.

1571
01:13:41,140 --> 01:13:49,140
Today, Matsumoto will take on the biggest challenge of this century.

1572
01:13:49,140 --> 01:13:56,140
I'll do it.

1573
01:13:56,140 --> 01:14:00,140
I don't want to run away.

1574
01:14:00,140 --> 01:14:03,140
It's okay to wind it up with a chain.

1575
01:14:03,140 --> 01:14:06,140
And welding.

1576
01:14:06,140 --> 01:14:08,140
I can't get out.

1577
01:14:08,140 --> 01:14:10,140
Have you ever done this?

1578
01:14:10,140 --> 01:14:14,140
This is the first time.

1579
01:14:14,140 --> 01:14:20,140
When I did it before, the car was black.

1580
01:14:20,140 --> 01:14:23,140
Who was watching at that time?

1581
01:14:23,140 --> 01:14:26,140
Who did you think was welding?

1582
01:14:26,140 --> 01:14:28,140
Who was around you?

1583
01:14:28,140 --> 01:14:31,140
Speak louder.

1584
01:14:31,140 --> 01:14:33,140
Who was around you?

1585
01:14:33,140 --> 01:14:35,140
Who was around you?

1586
01:14:35,140 --> 01:14:37,140
What?

1587
01:14:37,140 --> 01:14:39,140
What did you say?

1588
01:14:39,140 --> 01:14:41,140
Who was around you?

1589
01:14:41,140 --> 01:14:44,140
I don't know.

1590
01:14:44,140 --> 01:14:49,140
Finally, Matsumoto gets in the car.

1591
01:14:49,140 --> 01:14:52,140
What should I do?

1592
01:14:52,140 --> 01:14:53,140
I don't know.

1593
01:14:53,140 --> 01:14:55,140
I don't want to do it anymore.

1594
01:14:55,140 --> 01:14:57,140
I want to take a picture at 8mm.

1595
01:14:57,140 --> 01:14:59,140
I don't have a frame.

1596
01:14:59,140 --> 01:15:05,140
The car is chained and the escape is completely impossible.

1597
01:15:05,140 --> 01:15:13,140
It is even more carefully welded to the gap in the door of the car.

1598
01:15:13,140 --> 01:15:15,140
Matsumoto's expression changes.

1599
01:15:15,140 --> 01:15:17,140
Is it anxiety?

1600
01:15:17,140 --> 01:15:21,140
Or is his face scared?

1601
01:15:21,140 --> 01:15:23,140
What is it?

1602
01:15:23,140 --> 01:15:27,140
Are you going to raise the helicopter?

1603
01:15:27,140 --> 01:15:40,140
I'm sorry, but please give me a helicopter.

1604
01:15:40,140 --> 01:15:45,140
The sound of the helicopter engine echoes in the quiet place.

1605
01:15:45,140 --> 01:15:47,140
The car weighs 1.5 tons.

1606
01:15:47,140 --> 01:15:55,140
It's a very dangerous job just to lift it up.

1607
01:15:55,140 --> 01:16:01,140
At this time, Matsumoto's tension had reached its limit.

1608
01:16:01,140 --> 01:16:05,140
The helicopter that jumped continues hovering in the super low air.

1609
01:16:05,140 --> 01:16:18,140
It approaches the car that Matsumoto rode.

1610
01:16:18,140 --> 01:16:24,140
And the helicopter firmly connects the car with wires.

1611
01:16:24,140 --> 01:16:33,140
The helicopter slowly rises.

1612
01:16:33,140 --> 01:16:38,140
Will Matsumoto succeed?

1613
01:16:38,140 --> 01:16:59,140
This is the start of the ultimate challenge by Matsumoto.

1614
01:16:59,140 --> 01:17:14,140
Matsumoto is very excited.

1615
01:17:14,140 --> 01:17:16,140
Are you okay?

1616
01:17:16,140 --> 01:17:19,140
I'm shocked when I see that.

1617
01:17:19,140 --> 01:17:21,140
It's very high.

1618
01:17:21,140 --> 01:17:23,140
It's very high.

1619
01:17:23,140 --> 01:17:25,140
Look at that.

1620
01:17:25,140 --> 01:17:30,140
Are you okay?

1621
01:17:30,140 --> 01:17:33,140
It's very high.

1622
01:17:33,140 --> 01:17:37,140
It's very high.

1623
01:17:37,140 --> 01:17:43,140
Are you okay?

1624
01:17:43,140 --> 01:17:45,140
Are you okay?

1625
01:17:45,140 --> 01:17:49,140
How high is it?

1626
01:17:49,140 --> 01:17:57,140
It's very high.

1627
01:17:57,140 --> 01:18:01,140
It's amazing.

1628
01:18:01,140 --> 01:18:05,140
Can I drop this?

1629
01:18:05,140 --> 01:18:08,140
Everyone, let's go.

1630
01:18:08,140 --> 01:18:37,140
Everyone, let's go.

1631
01:18:37,140 --> 01:18:40,140
It's going.

1632
01:18:40,140 --> 01:18:47,140
It's going.

1633
01:18:47,140 --> 01:18:50,140
This is amazing.

1634
01:18:50,140 --> 01:18:52,140
Are you okay?

1635
01:18:52,140 --> 01:18:54,140
Is it over?

1636
01:18:54,140 --> 01:18:56,140
Should we go see it?

1637
01:18:56,140 --> 01:19:00,140
The car is very high.

1638
01:19:00,140 --> 01:19:05,140
I shouldn't have done that.

1639
01:19:05,140 --> 01:19:08,140
If I get hurt, will I be responsible for it?

1640
01:19:08,140 --> 01:19:13,140
He said that.

1641
01:19:13,140 --> 01:19:24,140
Let's go see it.

1642
01:19:24,140 --> 01:19:26,140
Are you okay?

1643
01:19:26,140 --> 01:19:28,140
It's over.

1644
01:19:28,140 --> 01:19:30,140
Are you okay?

1645
01:19:30,140 --> 01:19:38,140
It's over.

1646
01:19:38,140 --> 01:19:42,140
I did it.

1647
01:19:42,140 --> 01:19:44,140
It was longer than I thought.

1648
01:19:44,140 --> 01:19:54,140
I did it.

1649
01:19:54,140 --> 01:19:56,140
How did you feel when you fell?

1650
01:19:56,140 --> 01:20:02,140
I was surprised.

1651
01:20:02,140 --> 01:20:24,140
I did it.

1652
01:20:24,140 --> 01:20:26,140
Is it true?

1653
01:20:26,140 --> 01:20:32,140
Are you inspired?

1654
01:20:32,140 --> 01:20:35,140
I'm glad I didn't get hurt.

1655
01:20:35,140 --> 01:20:38,140
My face is a little dirty.

1656
01:20:38,140 --> 01:20:47,140
I'm glad I didn't get hurt.

1657
01:20:47,140 --> 01:20:49,140
What did you do?

1658
01:20:49,140 --> 01:20:54,140
I was surprised.

1659
01:20:54,140 --> 01:20:57,140
Are you serious?

1660
01:20:57,140 --> 01:21:00,140
I thought there was still time.

1661
01:21:00,140 --> 01:21:01,140
Down Power.

1662
01:21:01,140 --> 01:21:07,140
Tell a surprising dream.

1663
01:21:07,140 --> 01:21:08,140
Good evening.

1664
01:21:08,140 --> 01:21:10,140
I'm the president of Joron Electric.

1665
01:21:10,140 --> 01:21:12,140
My name is Shio Miyagi.

1666
01:21:12,140 --> 01:21:21,140
My dream is to go to space.

1667
01:21:21,140 --> 01:21:27,140
Tell me your dream.

1668
01:21:27,140 --> 01:21:30,140
I don't have a dream.

1669
01:21:30,140 --> 01:21:34,140
What month is this?

1670
01:21:34,140 --> 01:21:36,140
I think it's out now.

1671
01:21:36,140 --> 01:21:38,140
I want to go to space.

1672
01:21:38,140 --> 01:21:41,140
This is the same as me.

1673
01:21:41,140 --> 01:21:43,140
I want to go to space.

1674
01:21:43,140 --> 01:21:44,140
Why?

1675
01:21:44,140 --> 01:21:48,140
You said you wanted to go to space.

1676
01:21:48,140 --> 01:21:53,140
I want to go to space again.

1677
01:21:53,140 --> 01:21:56,140
Have you been to space before?

1678
01:21:56,140 --> 01:21:57,140
Yes.

1679
01:21:57,140 --> 01:22:01,140
I want to go to space like that time.

1680
01:22:01,140 --> 01:22:03,140
When was that?

1681
01:22:03,140 --> 01:22:12,140
That was when I was in the first year of high school.

1682
01:22:12,140 --> 01:22:13,140
When you were in the first year of high school?

1683
01:22:13,140 --> 01:22:14,140
Yes.

1684
01:22:14,140 --> 01:22:15,140
Did you go to space alone?

1685
01:22:15,140 --> 01:22:16,140
Yes.

1686
01:22:16,140 --> 01:22:17,140
Alone?

1687
01:22:17,140 --> 01:22:22,140
When I was in the first year of high school, I was in my prime.

1688
01:22:22,140 --> 01:22:24,140
You were in your prime?

1689
01:22:24,140 --> 01:22:27,140
What do you mean by prime?

1690
01:22:27,140 --> 01:22:29,140
Don't you know what a prime is?

1691
01:22:29,140 --> 01:22:31,140
I'm talking about my prime.

1692
01:22:31,140 --> 01:22:36,140
Don't you know what a prime is?

1693
01:22:36,140 --> 01:22:42,140
You said you were in your prime.

1694
01:22:42,140 --> 01:22:44,140
Don't you know what a prime is?

1695
01:22:44,140 --> 01:22:45,140
I don't know.

1696
01:22:45,140 --> 01:22:46,140
You really don't know what a prime is?

1697
01:22:46,140 --> 01:22:47,140
I don't know.

1698
01:22:47,140 --> 01:22:48,140
That's enough.

1699
01:22:48,140 --> 01:22:49,140
Why?

1700
01:22:49,140 --> 01:22:50,140
I don't know.

1701
01:22:50,140 --> 01:22:51,140
You can tell me.

1702
01:22:51,140 --> 01:22:53,140
I'm talking about space.

1703
01:22:53,140 --> 01:22:54,140
That's after that.

1704
01:22:54,140 --> 01:22:56,140
I'm talking about my prime.

1705
01:22:56,140 --> 01:22:59,140
You don't know what a prime is?

1706
01:22:59,140 --> 01:23:00,140
You're stupid.

1707
01:23:00,140 --> 01:23:01,140
I'm sorry.

1708
01:23:01,140 --> 01:23:03,140
Be careful.

1709
01:23:03,140 --> 01:23:05,140
Don't you know what a prime is?

1710
01:23:05,140 --> 01:23:07,140
I don't know.

1711
01:23:07,140 --> 01:23:09,140
I'm talking about space.

1712
01:23:09,140 --> 01:23:10,140
I'm talking about space.

1713
01:23:10,140 --> 01:23:12,140
Okay.

1714
01:23:12,140 --> 01:23:14,140
When I was in my prime.

1715
01:23:14,140 --> 01:23:21,140
When I was in my prime.

1716
01:23:21,140 --> 01:23:24,140
You have a lot of things at home.

1717
01:23:24,140 --> 01:23:28,140
Have you ever left the house because you didn't like it?

1718
01:23:28,140 --> 01:23:29,140
Not at home.

1719
01:23:29,140 --> 01:23:30,140
You haven't?

1720
01:23:30,140 --> 01:23:32,140
I have.

1721
01:23:32,140 --> 01:23:36,140
Have you ever been there?

1722
01:23:36,140 --> 01:23:37,140
Where?

1723
01:23:37,140 --> 01:23:39,140
To space.

1724
01:23:39,140 --> 01:23:40,140
You went to space at home?

1725
01:23:40,140 --> 01:23:42,140
I went to space at home.

1726
01:23:42,140 --> 01:23:44,140
How did you get there?

1727
01:23:44,140 --> 01:23:50,140
How did I get there?

1728
01:23:50,140 --> 01:23:55,140
How did you get there?

1729
01:23:55,140 --> 01:23:58,140
There's a way to get there.

1730
01:23:58,140 --> 01:24:04,140
With a lens.

1731
01:24:04,140 --> 01:24:06,140
Come on.

1732
01:24:06,140 --> 01:24:12,140
Do you have two hours to get there?

1733
01:24:12,140 --> 01:24:13,140
Are you ready?

1734
01:24:13,140 --> 01:24:14,140
Look up.

1735
01:24:14,140 --> 01:24:17,140
I want to go to space.

1736
01:24:17,140 --> 01:24:18,140
I can go.

1737
01:24:18,140 --> 01:24:23,140
That's for sure.

1738
01:24:23,140 --> 01:24:27,140
Your mouth is open.

1739
01:24:27,140 --> 01:24:28,140
I don't know what you're talking about.

1740
01:24:28,140 --> 01:24:33,140
I haven't been to space.

1741
01:24:33,140 --> 01:24:38,140
What do you want me to do?

1742
01:24:38,140 --> 01:24:39,140
What are you talking about?

1743
01:24:39,140 --> 01:24:40,140
That's what I want to say.

1744
01:24:40,140 --> 01:24:41,140
What are you talking about?

1745
01:24:41,140 --> 01:24:44,140
What are you talking about?

1746
01:24:44,140 --> 01:24:47,140
Do you have a drawer at home?

1747
01:24:47,140 --> 01:24:48,140
I have a drawer.

1748
01:24:48,140 --> 01:24:49,140
You have a drawer, right?

1749
01:24:49,140 --> 01:24:51,140
I'll give you a drawer.

1750
01:24:51,140 --> 01:24:53,140
I'll close it once.

1751
01:24:53,140 --> 01:24:54,140
I'll go inside.

1752
01:24:54,140 --> 01:24:55,140
I'll come out.

1753
01:24:55,140 --> 01:24:59,140
That's space.

1754
01:24:59,140 --> 01:25:03,140
Finally, he reveals Matsumoto's hidden secret.

1755
01:25:03,140 --> 01:25:09,140
You never wave your hand at the end of a child's talk.

1756
01:25:09,140 --> 01:25:10,140
I told you, didn't I?

1757
01:25:10,140 --> 01:25:13,140
I told you.

1758
01:25:13,140 --> 01:25:17,140
You often say goodbye to the end of a TV show.

1759
01:25:17,140 --> 01:25:20,140
I'll do it until this time next week.

1760
01:25:20,140 --> 01:25:21,140
Why do you do that?

1761
01:25:21,140 --> 01:25:24,140
Do you want a fan?

1762
01:25:24,140 --> 01:25:27,140
Why are you trying to sell a fan?

1763
01:25:27,140 --> 01:25:28,140
I'm not selling a fan.

1764
01:25:28,140 --> 01:25:29,140
I'm just saying goodbye.

1765
01:25:29,140 --> 01:25:31,140
That's not good.

1766
01:25:31,140 --> 01:25:33,140
I'm not that kind of man.

1767
01:25:33,140 --> 01:25:35,140
Do you sometimes do that?

1768
01:25:35,140 --> 01:25:36,140
No.

1769
01:25:36,140 --> 01:25:39,140
I've been on TV once before.

1770
01:25:39,140 --> 01:25:41,140
Do you have a reason to do that?

1771
01:25:41,140 --> 01:25:46,140
No.

1772
01:25:46,140 --> 01:25:48,140
I'm saying this.

1773
01:25:48,140 --> 01:25:50,140
No.

1774
01:25:50,140 --> 01:25:51,140
Really?

1775
01:25:51,140 --> 01:25:53,140
No.

1776
01:25:53,140 --> 01:25:55,140
That's strange.

1777
01:25:55,140 --> 01:26:03,140
When I'm working on TV, I'm the only one who watches it.

1778
01:26:03,140 --> 01:26:07,140
Please watch the VTR next time.

1779
01:26:07,140 --> 01:26:10,140
Tenshou Bukiya.

1780
01:26:10,140 --> 01:26:19,140
Please look forward to the next part 5.

1781
01:26:19,140 --> 01:26:24,140
Please give him a round of applause.

1782
01:26:24,140 --> 01:26:27,140
Hey, hey, hey.

1783
01:26:27,140 --> 01:26:30,140
What's this?

1784
01:26:30,140 --> 01:26:35,140
You're shaking it too much.

1785
01:26:35,140 --> 01:26:36,140
What's this?

1786
01:26:36,140 --> 01:26:40,140
The last one was a baseball game.

1787
01:26:40,140 --> 01:26:41,140
Right?

1788
01:26:41,140 --> 01:26:48,140
That was last year's play.

1789
01:26:48,140 --> 01:26:51,140
Do I have to tell you the reason?

1790
01:26:51,140 --> 01:26:53,140
There's no reason.

1791
01:26:53,140 --> 01:26:58,140
I just said goodbye consciously.

1792
01:26:58,140 --> 01:27:05,140
If you say goodbye naturally, your body will be like this.

1793
01:27:05,140 --> 01:27:12,140
When the alcohol runs out, I can't help it.

1794
01:27:12,140 --> 01:27:18,140
A woman's confession.

1795
01:27:18,140 --> 01:27:22,140
Where do you feel the sex appeal of a woman?

1796
01:27:22,140 --> 01:27:27,140
I'm still in my 50s and 60s.

1797
01:27:27,140 --> 01:27:33,140
I'm always aware that there are only women in my head who want to be popular with that girl.

1798
01:27:33,140 --> 01:27:36,140
I don't know if I can be young.

1799
01:27:36,140 --> 01:27:42,140
I'm attracted to a woman's blue charm.

1800
01:27:42,140 --> 01:27:48,140
Where do you feel the sex appeal of a woman?

1801
01:27:48,140 --> 01:27:53,140
Can I be honest with you?

1802
01:27:53,140 --> 01:27:56,140
You might think I'm a pervert.

1803
01:27:56,140 --> 01:28:01,140
I want you to feel it.

1804
01:28:01,140 --> 01:28:03,140
That's clear.

1805
01:28:03,140 --> 01:28:09,140
I get excited when there's something beautiful about a beautiful woman.

1806
01:28:09,140 --> 01:28:12,140
For example?

1807
01:28:12,140 --> 01:28:17,140
For example, a beautiful woman has a snot.

1808
01:28:17,140 --> 01:28:19,140
It's snot.

1809
01:28:19,140 --> 01:28:20,140
That's right.

1810
01:28:20,140 --> 01:28:25,140
Even if I say it, it's in the middle of my face.

1811
01:28:25,140 --> 01:28:26,140
That's right.

1812
01:28:26,140 --> 01:28:30,140
I get very excited.

1813
01:28:30,140 --> 01:28:33,140
I get very excited.

1814
01:28:33,140 --> 01:28:39,140
I get very excited.

1815
01:28:39,140 --> 01:28:43,140
I want you to feel it.

1816
01:28:43,140 --> 01:28:44,140
I get very excited.

1817
01:28:44,140 --> 01:28:47,140
I think that's why I don't like it.

1818
01:28:47,140 --> 01:28:52,140
I get very excited.

1819
01:28:52,140 --> 01:28:55,140
For example, I'm eating somewhere.

1820
01:28:55,140 --> 01:29:01,140
When I see a woman with a snot, I think it's funny.

1821
01:29:01,140 --> 01:29:02,140
I understand that.

1822
01:29:02,140 --> 01:29:04,140
I'm sorry.

1823
01:29:04,140 --> 01:29:06,140
I get very excited.

1824
01:29:06,140 --> 01:29:09,140
I'm just a stupid woman.

1825
01:29:09,140 --> 01:29:11,140
I go to the bathroom.

1826
01:29:11,140 --> 01:29:14,140
I see a woman with a snot.

1827
01:29:14,140 --> 01:29:17,140
I got a snot.

1828
01:29:17,140 --> 01:29:20,140
Damn it.

1829
01:29:20,140 --> 01:29:22,140
Why?

1830
01:29:22,140 --> 01:29:28,140
It's very beautiful, but when I do this, it looks like a snot.

1831
01:29:28,140 --> 01:29:31,140
It's a very good excuse.

1832
01:29:31,140 --> 01:29:35,140
I don't like that.

1833
01:29:35,140 --> 01:29:36,140
Why?

1834
01:29:36,140 --> 01:29:37,140
It's amazing, isn't it?

1835
01:29:37,140 --> 01:29:39,140
It's coming out.

1836
01:29:39,140 --> 01:29:41,140
I wonder if I can control it like this.

1837
01:29:41,140 --> 01:29:44,140
I wonder if I can run.

1838
01:29:44,140 --> 01:29:45,140
That part.

1839
01:29:45,140 --> 01:29:48,140
I wonder if it catches the radio waves there.

1840
01:29:48,140 --> 01:29:50,140
It's a problem if you fix it.

1841
01:29:50,140 --> 01:29:53,140
It's hard if you cut it.

1842
01:29:53,140 --> 01:29:55,140
I really want you to cut it.

1843
01:29:55,140 --> 01:29:57,140
I'm a woman.

1844
01:29:57,140 --> 01:29:58,140
I understand.

1845
01:29:58,140 --> 01:30:00,140
I want you to cut it, but I don't know if you cut it.

1846
01:30:00,140 --> 01:30:07,140
But I want you to cut it.

1847
01:30:07,140 --> 01:30:12,140
I'm most excited about the beautiful things with scars.

1848
01:30:12,140 --> 01:30:15,140
But it was different in the past.

1849
01:30:15,140 --> 01:30:20,140
Did you hate it just because you had a snot?

1850
01:30:20,140 --> 01:30:25,140
If I had a snot, I would have called it a poop.

1851
01:30:25,140 --> 01:30:26,140
If you had a snot?

1852
01:30:26,140 --> 01:30:29,140
If I had a snot, I would have called it a poop.

1853
01:30:29,140 --> 01:30:30,140
Did you hate it because you had a snot?

1854
01:30:30,140 --> 01:30:31,140
It's easy.

1855
01:30:31,140 --> 01:30:35,140
If I had a snot, I would have called it a poop.

1856
01:30:35,140 --> 01:30:37,140
I understand that.

1857
01:30:37,140 --> 01:30:38,140
That's why I treat it like a poop.

1858
01:30:38,140 --> 01:30:41,140
It's good to be on top of a poop.

1859
01:30:41,140 --> 01:30:46,140
When you go on a trip, you should go to a poop.

1860
01:30:46,140 --> 01:30:51,140
Matsumoto, the president of the country, is a student.

1861
01:30:51,140 --> 01:30:56,140
You are different when you have money.

1862
01:30:56,140 --> 01:30:59,140
Nice to meet you. I'm Sato Punch.

1863
01:30:59,140 --> 01:31:01,140
I have a question.

1864
01:31:01,140 --> 01:31:08,140
I got a nickname Sato Punch because I used to wear a punch perm.

1865
01:31:08,140 --> 01:31:12,140
The reason why I wore a punch perm was because I was in my 20s at that time.

1866
01:31:12,140 --> 01:31:17,140
I used to go out for a drink or go to a pink-related store.

1867
01:31:17,140 --> 01:31:22,140
I was often teased by the hostess that students should come to such a place.

1868
01:31:22,140 --> 01:31:25,140
That's why I wore a punch perm.

1869
01:31:25,140 --> 01:31:26,140
What do you think?

1870
01:31:26,140 --> 01:31:31,140
Please tell me what you did to avoid being teased.

1871
01:31:31,140 --> 01:31:33,140
This is a common thing.

1872
01:31:33,140 --> 01:31:37,140
Anyone can think of it.

1873
01:31:37,140 --> 01:31:42,140
I was never teased.

1874
01:31:42,140 --> 01:31:45,140
I was always teased.

1875
01:31:45,140 --> 01:31:49,140
I was called the left and right eye of the press.

1876
01:31:49,140 --> 01:31:51,140
I'm not afraid of it.

1877
01:31:51,140 --> 01:31:52,140
I don't feel bad about it.

1878
01:31:52,140 --> 01:31:55,140
No, no, no. I don't feel bad about it.

1879
01:31:55,140 --> 01:31:56,140
I don't feel bad about it.

1880
01:31:56,140 --> 01:31:57,140
No, no, no.

1881
01:31:57,140 --> 01:32:01,140
Everyone was looking at me with great eyes.

1882
01:32:01,140 --> 01:32:03,140
I don't feel bad about it.

1883
01:32:03,140 --> 01:32:08,140
I didn't feel bad about it.

1884
01:32:08,140 --> 01:32:10,140
Everyone was looking at me with great eyes.

1885
01:32:10,140 --> 01:32:12,140
Are you stupid?

1886
01:32:12,140 --> 01:32:16,140
Even in high school, I was teased by the student uniform.

1887
01:32:16,140 --> 01:32:18,140
My chest was open and my chest was sticking out.

1888
01:32:18,140 --> 01:32:19,140
What?

1889
01:32:19,140 --> 01:32:24,140
I was teased like this.

1890
01:32:24,140 --> 01:32:25,140
You were teased like that.

1891
01:32:25,140 --> 01:32:31,140
Yes, I was teased like this.

1892
01:32:31,140 --> 01:32:36,140
Now, I'd like to give you a wonderful present.

1893
01:32:36,140 --> 01:32:40,140
This time, I went to New York for a punishment game.

1894
01:32:40,140 --> 01:32:45,140
I'd like to give you a few things I used at that time.

1895
01:32:45,140 --> 01:32:52,140
First of all, this ugly cap that says I love New York.

1896
01:32:52,140 --> 01:32:55,140
And I put it on my head.

1897
01:32:55,140 --> 01:32:57,140
I don't know what it is.

1898
01:32:57,140 --> 01:32:59,140
It's shining.

1899
01:32:59,140 --> 01:33:01,140
It's shining because the world is shining.

1900
01:33:01,140 --> 01:33:02,140
And this bra.

1901
01:33:02,140 --> 01:33:07,140
And when I climbed this Empire State Building, I made it.

1902
01:33:07,140 --> 01:33:09,140
It stinks.

1903
01:33:09,140 --> 01:33:10,140
It stinks.

1904
01:33:10,140 --> 01:33:13,140
But I have four of these.

1905
01:33:13,140 --> 01:33:15,140
And look at this.

1906
01:33:15,140 --> 01:33:16,140
No one will buy it.

1907
01:33:16,140 --> 01:33:20,140
The person at the store told me to close it.

1908
01:33:20,140 --> 01:33:22,140
This necktie is the best.

1909
01:33:22,140 --> 01:33:25,140
I'm going to show this to everyone on TV.

1910
01:33:25,140 --> 01:33:33,140
And I'd like to give this cap to the world's Sakamoto Ryuichi.

1911
01:33:33,140 --> 01:33:35,140
I'd like to give this cap to everyone.

1912
01:33:35,140 --> 01:33:40,140
Please write what you want on the postcard and send it to me.

1913
01:33:40,140 --> 01:33:42,140
I'll be waiting.

1914
01:33:42,140 --> 01:33:44,140
It's me.

1915
01:33:44,140 --> 01:33:46,140
Does anyone know?

1916
01:33:46,140 --> 01:33:56,140
Thank you very much.
