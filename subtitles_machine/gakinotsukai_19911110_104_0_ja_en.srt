1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I am the master of Zura Miyaburiman, Mr. Masahoto.

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Nice to meet you.

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I am the master of Zura Miyaburiman, Mr. Masahoto.

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Do you know who Zura is?

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I have never worn a Zura.

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Do you always wear a Zura?

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Yes.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Do you shave?

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I shave once every two days.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Do you want to be a yoga master?

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
No.

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I am the master of Zura, Mr. Okajiro.

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Today, as I said, I will see through Zura.

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Leave it to me.

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Are you OK?

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I'm OK.

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Do you have a pot for hair?

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Yes, I have.

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Where?

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I have a pot.

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:29,000
That's why I have a pot.

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Here is the first question.

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Here is the first question.

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:45,000
How many of you are wearing a wig?

25
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
If you have a question, please answer it.

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I see.

27
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Three.

28
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
No, no, no.

29
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Three.

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
What?

31
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I have three.

32
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I know the number.

33
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Three?

34
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I can't answer yet.

35
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:10,000
You are fast.

36
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Any questions?

37
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Do you sweat?

38
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Sweat?

39
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Sweat?

40
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Do you get wet?

41
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Do you sweat?

42
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Do you sweat?

43
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Of course.

44
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Of course, I do.

45
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Sweat?

46
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Yes, I do.

47
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Sweat?

48
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Yes, I do.

49
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Sweat?

50
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Yes, I do.

51
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
What are you talking about?

52
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I'm just walking.

53
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I can hear you.

54
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
What are you talking about?

55
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Teacher.

56
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Please write down the numbers of the people you think have the same wig.

57
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Please write down the numbers of the people you think have the same wig.

58
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Mr. Director, please show your answer.

59
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Number one, number three, number five.

60
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Number one, number three, number five.

61
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
No.1 and No.2 are wearing the wig.

62
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
No.1, No.2, No.5.

63
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Now, Zura Mihamuriman.

64
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
1, 2, 3, 5.

65
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Let's start with No.1.

66
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
No.1, please.

67
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Wrong!

68
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
No.1 is correct!

69
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,000
No.2, please.

70
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Wrong!

71
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
No.2 is wearing the wig.

72
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
No.1, No.2, No.3, No.4.

73
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
That's strange.

74
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
No.3, please.

75
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
No.1, No.3, No.4.

76
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
No.1 and No.3 are wearing the wig.

77
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
No.4, please.

78
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Wrong!

79
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
If the last one is Zura,

80
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
No.1 is correct.

81
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Perfect.

82
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
No.5, please.

83
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
No.5, please.

84
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
No.5, please.

85
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
No?

86
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
No?

87
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
No.5, please.

88
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
No.5, please.

89
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
No.5, please.

90
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
No.5, please.

91
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
No.5, please.

92
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
No.5, please.

93
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
The last question.

94
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
5 people will appear.

95
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
5 people will appear.

96
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Please come to the front.

97
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Are you ready?

98
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Among these 5 men,

99
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
only one of them is wearing the wig.

100
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Let's guess who it is.

101
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
No.5, please.

102
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Do you play sports?

103
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I play baseball.

104
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Do you head-slide?

105
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
No.

106
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
No.2, please.

107
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
No.2, please.

108
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
No.2, please.

109
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Can you show us the atmosphere?

110
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I'm surprised.

111
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
No.3, please.

112
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I'm a diver.

113
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I'm diving.

114
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Diving?

115
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I play volleyball.

116
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Volleyball.

117
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Time is up.

118
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
You can use this flip.

119
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
No.1, No.2, No.3, No.4, No.5, please.

120
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Go!

121
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Let's start with No.5.

122
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Show us.

123
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
No.5.

124
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
No.5?

125
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
No.5.

126
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
No.5?

127
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
No.5?

128
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I'm drenched.

129
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I can't get that hair into my face.

130
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
This guy is ridiculous.

131
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I see.

132
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
No.5, please.

133
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
It's the most correct opinion.

134
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
No.2.

135
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I think this part is a little too much.

136
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Ah, this part?

137
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Yes, yes, yes.

138
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Now, the person with the correct answer, please take it off.

139
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Now, from 1 to 5, what number is it?

140
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
The person with the correct answer is the winner!

141
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
That means everyone, take it off!

142
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
What's so funny about me?

143
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Teacher, how about wearing that?

144
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:58,000
It suits you, doesn't it?

145
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Now, let's do our best today as well.

146
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Hey, you!

147
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
What?

148
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I'm asking you!

149
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Go and shave your beard!

150
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
You're so dirty!

151
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I got a cold from you!

152
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
What's with that?

153
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I can't do it anymore, it's really hard.

154
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
In your case, if you don't get a cold, it's fine.

155
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
In my case, what do you mean?

156
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Why?

157
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
The fever in your throat is about to go down, but you...

158
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
It's about to collapse.

159
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
What is he saying?

160
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I don't know, Marshall!

161
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Hey, are you Medaka-nii-san?

162
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Marshall, where are you?

163
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
What did you say?

164
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Sorry, I was sleeping until now.

165
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I don't know what to do!

166
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
What should I do?

167
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I'm going to get a cold.

168
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I'll do my best.

169
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Do your best, do your best.

170
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
You can't do it because you talk like that.

171
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
That's right.

172
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
But it's getting colder.

173
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Yeah, it's cold.

174
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
From now on, it's the hot pot season.

175
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
The hot pot season is good.

176
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
When you say hot pot, what kind of hot pot do you mean?

177
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Hot pot is...

178
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Fugu, right?

179
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Ah, Fugu...

180
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
It's a dream.

181
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I went to Fugu at the end of my dream.

182
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I was talking to Nan-chan.

183
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
There's a Fugu sashimi, right?

184
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
It's a thin sashimi that's spread out.

185
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I don't usually use it.

186
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
It's expensive.

187
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I don't have my own money.

188
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I took a lot of Fugu sashimi with chopsticks.

189
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I was saying, let's eat it.

190
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
And when it came out, I didn't know what to do.

191
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
It's up.

192
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
It's up.

193
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I couldn't eat it.

194
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I took too much.

195
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
It's a little fluffy.

196
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Did you take too much?

197
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I took four or five pieces.

198
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I'll eat it in my mouth forever.

199
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I don't think it's that good just by saying it, right?

200
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Even if it's Fugu, even if it's Matake, even if it's caviar, is it that good?

201
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Right.

202
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
It's crab miso.

203
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Ah, crab miso.

204
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I don't think you're crazy to eat that.

205
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:20,000
When you break the shell of a crab, it looks like a beard.

206
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
You're crazy to eat that.

207
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
You're crazy.

208
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
You're so mean.

209
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I didn't know how to eat it, so I thought I was poor.

210
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
One day, a crab came to my house.

211
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
What's that?

212
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,000
It's the first time a crab has come to your house.

213
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:48,000
When I was shaking my legs, my dad opened the shell of the crab and ate it.

214
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
My house is so poor.

215
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
How far have you gone?

216
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
How far have you gone?

217
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
What kind of person is my dad?

218
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I don't know.

219
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
You don't know, do you?

220
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
That's not true.

221
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I don't want to go to eat with this guy.

222
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
It's a child's idea.

223
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
What is it?

224
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:17,000
When I go to eat with this guy, it's a hamburger steak.

225
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
It's a child.

226
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
That's not true.

227
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
You don't eat that, do you?

228
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I eat it at home.

229
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
You don't eat pickled radish, do you?

230
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I eat it. I really like it.

231
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
You must eat it.

232
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I eat it.

233
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,000
It's like fried chicken.

234
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
What is fried chicken?

235
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
That's a child.

236
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
That's not true.

237
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
You don't eat that, do you?

238
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I eat it.

239
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
You eat a lot.

240
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I'm talking to a yakuza.

241
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I don't spend money on food.

242
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
That's not true.

243
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I don't spend a thousand yen.

244
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
How many chickens do you think I have?

245
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:16,000
When I go to a family restaurant, I always have a set.

246
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I also have a set.

247
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I don't ask for a single dish.

248
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I don't have to brag about it.

249
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Let's change the topic.

250
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Since this program started, the number of customers has increased, hasn't it?

251
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
That's right.

252
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
It's doubled.

253
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Is it increasing?

254
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
It's increasing, but there are many people who don't want to see it.

255
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
How many people are there in one sheet of paper?

256
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Three or four people, right?

257
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
That's why I really want to see it.

258
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I want to see it.

259
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
There are four people.

260
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I don't care about the other three people.

261
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I don't care.

262
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I'm a fan of Ucchanan.

263
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
That's right.

264
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I'm also a fan of Ryuta Mine.

265
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I'm the best at making money.

266
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
If you make money, people laugh.

267
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I can't make money.

268
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I can't laugh for 41 yen.

269
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I was like that, too.

270
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
When the Drifters came,

271
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Did you go to the Drifters?

272
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
That's right.

273
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
What?

274
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
When?

275
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I went there when I was in high school.

276
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
You went to see the Drifters when you were in high school?

277
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
You went to see the Drifters when you were in high school?

278
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I went with a girl.

279
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
That's cool.

280
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
You went to see the Drifters when you were in high school?

281
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Yes.

282
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
When I went to see the Drifters, there were only kids.

283
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Of course.

284
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I was the only adult there.

285
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
There was also a suburb.

286
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
There was also a suburb.

287
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
When I was sitting down,

288
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Mr. Chou was wearing sports shoes.

289
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
He came to me and said,

290
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Hey!

291
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
People around me said,

292
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Hey!

293
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I was like that, too.

294
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I saw that.

295
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Don't you often go to concerts like that?

296
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I didn't.

297
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:14,000
You took me to the Takadamizue concert once.

298
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I went to the Takadamizue concert.

299
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
It was at the opening of Garasuzaka.

300
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Garasuzaka.

301
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Shut up!

302
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I went to the Takadamizue concert.

303
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I said, Takadamizue.

304
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I went to see the concert.

305
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I said, Garasuzaka.

306
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I said, I'm going to meet Takadamizue.

307
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
You said that, too.

308
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
You said, I'm the idiot who was watching it.

309
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
You're so cool.

310
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
When I was little,

311
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I was taken away by my aunt.

312
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Saigo Teruhiko.

313
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I like you, but...

314
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Hello, Dan-dan.

315
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I have a question for you two.

316
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Why do you always choose weird bread?

317
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
What do you think?

318
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I don't know.

319
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
It's like, if you roll it, it's okay, right?

320
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Their Parma is amazing, isn't it?

321
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
One year ago,

322
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
my mom said,

323
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I'm going to clean up the Parma shop.

324
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I said, really?

325
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I took the class,

326
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
and I thought you were coming,

327
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
so I looked at you.

328
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
You look like a Mongolian.

329
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I don't know what Mongolians are like.

330
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
It's amazing.

331
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
It's a big lot.

332
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
It's big, isn't it?

333
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
It's big, isn't it?

334
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
And I can't believe it.

335
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
You shouldn't do it as a human being.

336
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
It's like this.

337
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
The bottle is so tight.

338
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I don't see it that often these days.

339
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
It's like Kabuto Kouji from Majinger Z.

340
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
In the past,

341
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
when I looked at the Parma shop,

342
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
all the women were wearing capsules like this.

343
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
That's right.

344
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
It's like a brainwave test.

345
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
They were lined up like this.

346
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
It's not like that these days.

347
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
It's really tough to be a mother.

348
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Didn't they give you a hard time?

349
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
When you were in elementary school?

350
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
When I was little.

351
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Did they give you a hard time when you were little?

352
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
They said they liked me.

353
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
They said they liked you.

354
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
It's so annoying.

355
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I can't stand it.

356
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I thought you were going too far.

357
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
What are you talking about?

358
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I'm fine.

359
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I'm fine.

360
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
When I looked at the finished product,

361
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
it was like a dance.

362
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Why are you making fun of me?

363
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Even if you think like that,

364
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
you're still a man.

365
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
What are you talking about?

366
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
You're still a man.

367
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
You know what I mean, right?

368
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
You know,

369
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I thought you killed him the most.

370
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
You know,

371
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
you go home sometimes.

372
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
So,

373
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I asked you to sign it,

374
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
but you didn't sign it.

375
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Right?

376
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I don't care.

377
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
You didn't sign it when you went home.

378
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I'm counting on you.

379
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I'm counting on you.

380
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Don't say I'm counting on you.

381
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Your face looks good.

382
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Call me by the name you gave me.

383
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I'll say it.

384
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I'll say it.

385
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I'll say it.

386
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I'll say it.

387
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I'll say it.

388
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I'm interested in a girl.

389
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
When I followed her,

390
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
there was a dog at home.

391
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
The dog's fur was covered with poop.

392
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
There were eggs in the flower.

393
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
It was blue.

394
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
What should I do?

395
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I don't know.

396
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
What should I do?

397
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
You don't like the girl you like, right?

398
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Right.

399
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
It's hard.

400
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I often see a girl's shoes.

401
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
The shoes look like a bottle cap.

402
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
It's stuck.

403
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
It's broken.

404
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
It's true.

405
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
If you boil it with soy sauce,

406
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
it will be fine.

407
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I have one.

408
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Right?

409
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
And the sneakers.

410
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
This area has been

411
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
beaten many times.

412
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
It's thin.

413
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
It's like a mini bomb.

414
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I have one.

415
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I used to wear a mini bomb.

416
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Here and there.

417
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I don't like men.

418
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
When I was in elementary school,

419
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I wore sneakers all the time.

420
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
This part is broken.

421
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Because it's beautiful.

422
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
When I was training,

423
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I was doing this.

424
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
When I looked down,

425
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
this part was broken.

426
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
And my shoes were broken.

427
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I thought it was cool.

428
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
My toes were like this.

429
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Like this.

430
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
My toes were like this.

431
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I was like this inside.

432
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
And I had tight clothes.

433
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
When you were in middle school,

434
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
you had tight clothes.

435
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
You didn't know that.

436
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
That's right.

437
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I couldn't stand it.

438
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I wore a white T-shirt.

439
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
It was a short sleeve.

440
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
What kind of design is that?

441
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
It's different.

442
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
It's a short sleeve.

443
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
It's tight.

444
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
It's winter.

445
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
It's a short sleeve in winter.

446
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
It's a lie.

447
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,000
It's obviously small.

448
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
If you wear it like this,

449
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
what will you do?

450
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
It's cold.

451
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
It's cold.

452
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I like women.

453
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I don't like women who have hair on their head.

454
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I feel sorry for them.

455
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
If you have hair on your head,

456
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
you're not lucky.

457
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
You're like this.

458
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
That's why it's hard.

459
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
When you have hair on your head,

460
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
you're like this.

461
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
That's what I thought.

462
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
It's not like that.

463
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
It's not like that.

464
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
That's why it's hard.

465
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
That's why it's hard.

466
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
It's cold.

467
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
It's cold.

468
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I always say that.

469
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
It's time to eat.

470
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
That's what he does.

471
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Here.

472
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
It's been three days since it was made.

473
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
I was there.

474
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
It's cold.

475
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
I was angry.

476
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I said,

477
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
It's cold.

478
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I like women.

479
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
This is America.

480
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
That's also hard.

481
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
He did it, too.

482
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
What?

483
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
He did it, too.

484
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
All of them.

485
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:08,000
He did it, too.

486
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
The hardest thing is

487
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
his nose.

488
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
That's not good.

489
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
That's not good.

490
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
His nose is like this.

491
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
He does like this.

492
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Is there such a big animal?

493
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,000
If you do like this,

494
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
you won't notice it.

495
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I was swaying.

496
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
You were swaying.

497
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I was swaying.

498
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
I don't know if you think of yourself as Hamada,

499
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
but you were Hanakuso-Soyoga.

500
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
I was swaying.

501
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
You went to the toilet.

502
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
You went to the toilet.

503
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
When you looked in the mirror,

504
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
you noticed Hanakuso was swaying.

505
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I was Hanakuso-Soyoga?

506
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
But this is hard.

507
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:03,000
You were swaying, but you didn't notice it.

508
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:08,000
But that's not good.

509
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
What should we do?

510
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Let's leave it for now.

511
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Let's go home.

512
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Pretend you didn't notice it.

513
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
If you take it,

514
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:24,000
while we are talking,

515
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
what should we do?

516
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Let's take it while we are talking.

517
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,000
The opening was amazing.

518
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Did you do your best?

519
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Mr. Namikoshi Tokujirou.

520
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
He is a really fun person.

521
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Amazing.

522
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Was it intense?

523
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
It was, but it's enough.

524
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,000
If you want to see more,

525
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
please send us your books.

526
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
All the books are the same.

527
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
If you have any questions,

528
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
or if you want us to read them,

529
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
please write them down and send them.

530
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
We will continue to write.

531
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Until next time,

532
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
goodbye.

533
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
We are really waiting for you.

534
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Thank you.
