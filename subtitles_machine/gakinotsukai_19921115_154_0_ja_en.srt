1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The 4th Gaki no Tsukai, Tsukitsuki, Ogiri, Daigatsu!

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Good evening, everyone. I'm Masatoshi Hamada, the 4th Gaki no Tsukai.

3
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Now, let's have Hanashika-san come on stage. Hanashika-san, please!

4
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Hanashika-san, please introduce yourself one by one.

5
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Thank you very much. The other day, I received a letter from a fan, and there was a hiragana on every kanji.

6
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm not an idiot! Look at me! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

7
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:21,000
The other day, Mr. Hamada appeared on the main character's drama, and when I acted, he said,

8
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Yes, okay! What do you mean by that? I'll do my best!

9
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Thank you very much!

10
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:44,000
The other day, I co-starred with Yumero Oyako. I'm the manager, Okamoto. Nice to meet you.

11
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I'm Matsuro Toshitoshi, 29 years old. My favorite show is Tsukitsuki!

12
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Now, let's have Hanashika-san come on stage.

13
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Excuse me, Mr. Hamada. May I introduce myself?

14
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Excuse me.

15
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I'm your assistant, and I'm the director...

16
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
What are you talking about?

17
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
What are you talking about?

18
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I'm Tokusho Atakamo!

19
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

20
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
That's enough!

21
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I'm going to use this book, and I'm going to read a book as if it were written by Atakamo.

22
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:43,000
First of all, this is Michael Jackson's story.

23
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Start!

24
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Hello!

25
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
The title of the book is Hello!

26
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I was born in Ohio.

27
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Is that so?

28
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I was born at the age of 18, and I had a plastic surgery.

29
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
You had a plastic surgery at the age of 18, didn't you?

30
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Yes.

31
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Until I had a plastic surgery, I had nicknames such as Jacky, Silica, Jack-yan, and Mai-san.

32
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
That's enough!

33
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Don't give me nicknames!

34
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:40,000
When I was on my first date, Mai-san touched my nose.

35
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Don't touch me!

36
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I was angry.

37
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
At that time, she said...

38
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I did it!

39
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
She did it.

40
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I did it!

41
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
She did it at that time.

42
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
She did it at that time.

43
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I wonder if I should have done more.

44
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:29,000
But Mai-san said this.

45
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Mai-san said,

46
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
If you like me, catch me.

47
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
What are you talking about?

48
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
No, no, no, no, no.

49
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
What, is it Hamabe?

50
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
It's Hamabe.

51
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Hamabe.

52
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:47,000
And Mai-san's nose was removed.

53
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Don't take it, don't take it.

54
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I closed my eyes slowly.

55
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I'm in the present.

56
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Next is here.

57
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Headphone full-on game.

58
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
The music is playing from the headphones.

59
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I'm going to tell you what I'm saying in order.

60
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,000
The first topic is here.

61
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:37,000
The winner is...

62
00:05:37,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Dave Spector.

63
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
What?

64
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Is there such a word?

65
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Why?

66
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Taylor Senpuda.

67
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Taylor Senpuda.

68
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
What is that?

69
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I don't know either.

70
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Okamoto-san.

71
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:45,000
The answer is Dave Spector.

72
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Don't clap.

73
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
What was your name?

74
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Dave Spector.

75
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I'm Dave Spector too.

76
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Dave Senpuda.

77
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Dave Spector.

78
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
The answer is...

79
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:15,000
The winner is Dave Spector.

80
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
The last topic is here.

81
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:23,000
The music is playing from the headphones.

82
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Today...

83
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Why do you say today twice?

84
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I'm emphasizing today.

85
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Yay, yay, yay.

86
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Today...

87
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
That's enough.

88
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I have something at home.

89
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
That's good.

90
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I have something at home.

91
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Let's go.

92
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Get ready.

93
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Go ahead.

94
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
You are a funky monkey baby.

95
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I'm going crazy.

96
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
But I'm in love.

97
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
My girlfriend...

98
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Ok, guitar.

99
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:10,000
That's too much.

100
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
That's too much.

101
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
That's too much.

102
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
What about the solo guitar?

103
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
What about the solo guitar?

104
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I said ok.

105
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
You said it.

106
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I said it.

107
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Yamazaki.

108
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Yes.

109
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Which one?

110
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
This one.

111
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
The toilet.

112
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:38,000
The toilet.

113
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Yay, yay, yay.

114
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Is it convenient for you?

115
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Yay, yay, yay.

116
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Yes.

117
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Yes.

118
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I can't get out.

119
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Next.

120
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
And me.

121
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Chin chin.

122
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
V V.

123
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Ie-chan.

124
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Shawa-chan.

125
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Ie-chan.

126
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Shawa-chan.

127
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Next.

128
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Yes.

129
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I'm a monster human who lives in the dark.

130
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I'm a monster human who can't show himself to others.

131
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I want to be a human soon.

132
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I'll shoot away the dark fate.

133
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
It's a black bat.

134
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
It's a black bat.

135
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,000
It's a monster shark.

136
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:06,000
And gentlemen.

137
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Good morning.

138
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Good morning.

139
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
It's been a long time since I started.

140
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
It's the same as usual.

141
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Yes, yes, yes.

142
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
It can't be helped.

143
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,000
After all, it's all up to the audience to get on the stage.

144
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
That's right.

145
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
The audience is bad.

146
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
The audience is bad.

147
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
If the audience is bad, I won't get on the stage.

148
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I see.

149
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I don't think it's a good audience today.

150
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Is that so?

151
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
You know, before Team Zero goes on stage, a girl goes on stage, right?

152
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Yes.

153
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Not a single girl laughs.

154
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
It's like being in a team.

155
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
It's quiet.

156
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Why do you think Team Zero is doing this?

157
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
There's still a long way to go.

158
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
It's no good.

159
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Well, I don't have any comedians to be acknowledged.

160
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
What?

161
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
What?

162
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Don't bite me again.

163
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Don't you have any comedians to be acknowledged?

164
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I didn't say I didn't have any comedians.

165
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I don't have any.

166
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I don't have any.

167
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I understand.

168
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Let's give them a name.

169
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
What are you doing?

170
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I don't have any comedians to be acknowledged.

171
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
If you say that, then...

172
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Enoken.

173
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
That's old-fashioned.

174
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I thought that was true.

175
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
If I don't say why I don't have comedians to be acknowledged,

176
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
they'll think I'm rude.

177
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Let me explain this.

178
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
What is it?

179
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
It's natural not to be acknowledged.

180
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Why?

181
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Because today is more interesting than yesterday, and tomorrow is more interesting than today.

182
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I'm next to you.

183
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
There's no reason why the comedy in the past is more interesting than the comedy in the present.

184
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I understand.

185
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Then, I can't be acknowledged in the present.

186
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
For example...

187
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Don't say it.

188
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
For example, I did this.

189
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I got this much.

190
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
This is the present.

191
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
But the next one is in the past.

192
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I can't be acknowledged in the present.

193
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
That's already in the past.

194
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I don't think about the present.

195
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Why are you being so honest?

196
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
You're so mean, Maria.

197
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Why?

198
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Who is acknowledged?

199
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
That's better, isn't it?

200
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I'm acknowledged.

201
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I'm acknowledged.

202
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
That's right.

203
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I can't be acknowledged in the present.

204
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:48,000
But to be honest, I'm the most interesting one.

205
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
That's good.

206
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I know that.

207
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Who is not acknowledged?

208
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
That's great.

209
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,000
There's a scream machine in this hall.

210
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:10,000
There is a scream machine.

211
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
There's a scream machine in your hall.

212
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I've heard that you complain to people in your life.

213
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I didn't hear that.

214
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I'm going to have a bad talk again this week.

215
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I'm going to do this 30 minutes.

216
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
You're the one who's talking.

217
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Get back the human mind.

218
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
There was a magazine written by Mie Nakawa.

219
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,000
He said something like this recently.

220
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
He said, I only say bad things.

221
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I've been watching you since you started laughing.

222
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
You can laugh even if you don't say bad things.

223
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Why do you only say bad things?

224
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Disappointment.

225
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
This is a really good word.

226
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
This is a good word.

227
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I'm not good at saying such things.

228
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,000
After all, when I'm told, I can't accept it honestly.

229
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
What's right is right.

230
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
No matter how many bad words you say.

231
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Is that so?

232
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Let's admit that.

233
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
So it's okay.

234
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I just wanted to ask you a little bit at first.

235
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Because you say that.

236
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Let's stop doing that.

237
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
That's right.

238
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Saying that kind of thing.

239
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
It's a sense of resentment.

240
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
It's a sense of resentment.

241
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
What is it?

242
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
But I can't see Nagao saying that.

243
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I can't see Nagao saying that.

244
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I can't help it.

245
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
This is a pattern.

246
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I want to laugh.

247
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Recently, I've been having bad luck.

248
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I've been having bad luck.

249
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
There was a time when it was popular.

250
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
There was a time when it was popular.

251
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Is there such a thing?

252
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I don't know if the fortune teller is right.

253
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
There's definitely a Biorhythm of fortune.

254
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Why? Did something happen?

255
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
No, it's not bad.

256
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,000
What is it?

257
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I'm scared.

258
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
If you say that kind of thing.

259
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
It's a sense of resentment.

260
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I can't help it.

261
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
It's a sense of resentment.

262
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
It's a gang.

263
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Why?

264
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
No, it's not good.

265
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
It's too bad.

266
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Why don't you have a better woman?

267
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,040
It's a woman with a more

268
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:29,040
It's a woman with a more

269
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,040
It's a woman with a more

270
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,040
I'm a fan.

271
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,040
I'm a fan.

272
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:39,040
Why don't you send me a picture?

273
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,040
Why do you say that?

274
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,040
It's true that this Hitoshi Matsumoto is.

275
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:43,040
It's true that this Hitoshi Matsumoto is.

276
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,040
It's true that this Hitoshi Matsumoto is.

277
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,040
It's a pretty good rank.

278
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,040
But Hitoshi Matsumoto.

279
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,040
Who are you?

280
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,040
I'm right next to you.

281
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,040
I don't have a woman.

282
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,040
Do you have that?

283
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,040
No, I used to have a little more.

284
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,040
That's forcibly, isn't it?

285
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,040
It's like a rape killer.

286
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,040
No, it's not forcibly.

287
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,040
No, it's not forcibly.

288
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,040
Even if you don't have a lover.

289
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,040
Even if you don't have a lover.

290
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,040
Even if you don't have a lover.

291
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,040
If you persuade me with this,

292
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,040
First of all,

293
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,040
I don't have a woman to marry.

294
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,040
Women are basically stupid creatures.

295
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,040
Women are basically stupid creatures.

296
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,040
Is that so?

297
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,040
Women are stupid creatures.

298
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,040
What do you mean?

299
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,040
You say men and women are equal, right?

300
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,040
That's absolutely impossible.

301
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,040
Why?

302
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,040
For example,

303
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,040
I'm doing men and women are equal.

304
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,040
What do you mean?

305
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,040
For example, there are ugly boys.

306
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,040
You say you want to look ugly.

307
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,040
Even if the girl is ugly,

308
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,040
I say I'm ugly.

309
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,040
That's called men and women are equal.

310
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,040
It's men and women are equal.

311
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,040
I say I'm a pig.

312
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,040
To a woman who is fat.

313
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,040
When I say that,

314
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,040
It's horrible for a girl.

315
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,040
I say it with a ugly face.

316
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:09,040
I'm doing men and women are equal.

317
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:11,040
I'm doing men and women are equal.

318
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:13,040
A woman who says it's bad for me.

319
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:15,040
I don't have the right to say it's men and women are equal.

320
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:17,040
Is that so?

321
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:19,040
Men and women are equal, right?

322
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:21,040
Yes.

323
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:25,040
There are times when you hit a man like this, and sometimes you hit a woman like this.

324
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:27,040
You hit a woman by force?

325
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:29,040
No, I was pissed off.

326
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,040
This is a good thing you're saying now, Hama-chan.

327
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:33,040
Why?

328
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:35,040
Yamashiro, stop it.

329
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:37,040
This is a good thing you're saying now, Hama-chan.

330
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:42,040
Today I will introduce the story of Totteki.

331
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:44,040
Totteki?

332
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:47,040
Yes, Totteki.

333
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,040
That's a big one.

334
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:51,040
That's Mutsugoro.

335
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:56,040
The other day, I found him at a famous hotel in Tokyo.

336
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,040
I approached him and asked,

337
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:00,040
Are you Mutsugoro?

338
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,040
He said,

339
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:03,040
Yes, I am.

340
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,040
What kind of attitude is that?

341
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,040
He said,

342
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:08,040
Yes, I am.

343
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:14,040
What kind of disease is this?

344
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:16,040
I asked him,

345
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:20,040
I don't understand why an amateur like you would say something like this.

346
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:24,040
I didn't write it.

347
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,040
You're dead.

348
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:28,040
I didn't write it.

349
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,040
Chatoran.

350
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:34,040
I didn't write it.

351
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:37,040
I didn't write it.

352
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:41,040
But if it's true, it's amazing.

353
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:45,040
I don't know if he's an animal lover.

354
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,040
He likes all animals, right?

355
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,040
That's right.

356
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:52,040
But animals are very discriminated against, right?

357
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:57,040
If someone calls him a dog or a wolf or a baby,

358
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,040
He's loved a lot.

359
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,040
Like a kid.

360
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:01,040
If you say you're going to kill a kid,

361
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:03,040
Everyone says, I feel sorry for you.

362
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:06,040
What about sharks?

363
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:13,040
I don't know why sharks are killed so easily.

364
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,040
Is that so?

365
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:18,040
Everyone here is a shark, so it doesn't matter how peaceful it is.

366
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:22,040
So if I love all animals,

367
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:24,040
I'll admit it.

368
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:26,040
Even in the sea,

369
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:33,040
If you say you're going to kill a shark,

370
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:39,040
People will think you really love animals.

371
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:44,040
If Matsumoto is a TV producer and makes a trendy detective drama,

372
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:46,040
What kind of title would you like?

373
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:50,040
But I think we need to think a little more.

374
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:52,040
What kind of title do you have now?

375
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:54,040
What are you?

376
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:56,040
Dekakizoku.

377
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:57,040
Dekakizoku.

378
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:00,040
What is Dekakizoku?

379
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:02,040
What are you talking about?

380
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,040
That's right.

381
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,040
Dekakizoku.

382
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:08,040
It's an interesting show for those who are doing it.

383
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,040
That's right.

384
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:11,040
What kind of title do you have now?

385
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:13,040
What are you talking about?

386
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:15,040
What is Dekakizoku?

387
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,040
You're a TV producer, aren't you?

388
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:18,040
Idiot!

389
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:21,040
People who are on TV are really nice,

390
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:24,040
What are you talking about?

391
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,040
Dekakizoku.

392
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,040
Dekakizoku.

393
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:38,040
It sounds good, doesn't it?

394
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,040
What else do you have?

395
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,040
What else do you have?

396
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,040
What is Dekakizoku?

397
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,040
That's right.

398
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,040
Dangerous.

399
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,040
Dangerous Dekakizoku.

400
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,040
Dangerous Dekakizoku.

401
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:51,040
Dangerous Dekakizoku.

402
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:54,040
What are you talking about?

403
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,040
Dangerous Dekakizoku.

404
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,040
Dangerous Dekakizoku.

405
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:59,040
Dangerous Dekakizoku.

406
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:01,040
Where did you do that?

407
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:05,040
Did you do it?

408
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:07,040
I think the title should be played more.

409
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:09,040
I think it will change more and more from now on.

410
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,040
I see.

411
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:15,040
Dekakizoku had seven dekakizoku, didn't it?

412
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,040
In the past.

413
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,040
In the past.

414
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:21,040
Even so, five or six dekakizoku.

415
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:25,040
How do you do that?

416
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:28,040
It's already spring.

417
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:31,040
You said five or six dekakizoku.

418
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:35,040
What are you going to do with the opening?

419
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:39,040
Normally, you come out with a detective or something.

420
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:42,040
What are you going to do with five or six dekakizoku?

421
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:46,040
That's why it starts with walking on the airfield.

422
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,040
I know.

423
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,040
Five or six dekakizoku.

424
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,040
It's like G-men 75.

425
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:51,040
What are you going to walk?

426
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:56,040
There's a guy like this who's a little out of the blank.

427
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,040
There's something.

428
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,040
Half out.

429
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,040
Half out.

430
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,040
Half out.

431
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:04,040
There's something.

432
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:06,040
Can you do it properly?

433
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,040
What?

434
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,040
In the drama.

435
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:13,040
In the drama.
