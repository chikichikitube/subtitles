1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I don't want to go to court for being a Tare Panda

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
But it's embarrassing for you to go to court with such a serious face

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I don't care about that!

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Idiot!

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
It's completely different

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
What is it?

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Hamada

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
You can't do this!

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
You can't do it right away

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Have you ever done it right away after coming here for 10 years?

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I haven't

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
There was Shigonchi

13
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Shigonchi is short

14
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
It's been a long time

15
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
The reason why you can't do it right away is because

16
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I've been thinking about it for the past 2-3 weeks

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I found out one thing

18
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
What is it?

19
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
There is no gag

20
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
There is no gag

21
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Don't say such a big thing

22
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
There is no need for a gag

23
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
So today

24
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Even if Hamada thinks about it

25
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
It's a simple story

26
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
If you look over there, you can see

27
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Today there is a god of gags

28
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
It's a thank you from the god of gags

29
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Let's get it

30
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Yamada-kun has a gag, right?

31
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I have a lot

32
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
What is it?

33
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Yay, yay, yay

34
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I have a lot

35
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Like this

36
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
For example, if you're walking on the street

37
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
You'll be told to smile

38
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
If you don't smile, you won't be able to do it

39
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
You won't be able to do it

40
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I have a lot

41
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
You still have a lot

42
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
You have a lot

43
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I have a lot too

44
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Alice's Bikkuri Mankai

45
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
That was amazing

46
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Matsumoto doesn't have a gag

47
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
You have a lot

48
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I have a lot

49
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Hoyo Hoyo's Pao

50
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Hoyo Hoyo's Pao

51
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Please look forward to the second episode

52
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
This program is brought to you by the sponsor you are watching

53
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Do you have any data from the past?

54
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
We have data

55
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Are you ready?

56
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
First, let's see Tsukami's gag

57
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
This is definitely important

58
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
There are many

59
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Dachou Club

60
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I don't think this is interesting

61
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
But if you say no, it's Dachou

62
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
And this

63
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Welcome

64
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
And this

65
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
1, 2, 3

66
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Is this a gag?

67
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
This is a gag

68
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I'm just saying it to make you feel better

69
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
But at the end of the game, let's all do it together

70
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
That's right

71
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Matsumoto

72
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
It's not a gag

73
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I didn't hear it, but I just made it a gag

74
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I'll do it

75
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
If you don't put it back in

76
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
It's bad

77
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Let's put it back in

78
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
It's 36 yen

79
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
It's bad to say it's a gag

80
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
It's 36 yen

81
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Daimyojin

82
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Please

83
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
For your mother

84
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Edo River, Tamagawa, Chinchin River

85
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Wait, wait

86
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Thank you

87
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Thank you

88
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Wait, wait

89
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Where did you get that?

90
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Thank you

91
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Edo River, Tamagawa, Chinchin River

92
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
That's not a gag

93
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
You don't want to do it, right?

94
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
It's not for us

95
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Yamaguchi, how much did you put in?

96
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
36 yen

97
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
That's

98
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
If it was that little, you wouldn't be able to do it

99
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
It's 36 yen

100
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
You don't have money?

101
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
It's weird if I put it in

102
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
You put it in

103
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Should we put in 500 yen?

104
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Let's put in 500 yen

105
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Let's put in 550 yen

106
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Thank you

107
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Thank you

108
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Edo River, Tamagawa, Chinchin River

109
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
You're skipping your nails

110
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
That was funny

111
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I kept it

112
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
It's a different pattern

113
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
It's not a gag

114
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
It's a different pattern

115
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I think Tsukami is like that

116
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
It's a gag using things

117
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Kami-san

118
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
You just said it's like that

119
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
It was like that

120
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
It's a gag using things

121
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
For example, there's this

122
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
It's from a YouTuber

123
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
This is

124
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
If there's something like this, it's a joke

125
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Is this a gag?

126
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Worldwide

127
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
With this, Yuri Geller can eat for the rest of his life

128
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
That's right

129
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Actually, we've prepared a lot of things

130
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Really?

131
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
We've prepared a lot of things

132
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Is it like this?

133
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Don't pretend to be good

134
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
If it's Yamazaki, what will happen?

135
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
We can do it right away

136
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Really?

137
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Please tell us Yamazaki's gag

138
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
This is a prank

139
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
It's like this

140
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
It's a joke

141
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
If it's Kami-san

142
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
What will happen?

143
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Is it okay if I don't do it?

144
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I'm sorry

145
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Is it okay if it's just Kami-san?

146
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Please take care of Kami-san

147
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Please take care of Kami-san

148
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Kami-san, it's wrong

149
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Kami-san, it's wrong

150
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
It's completely wrong

151
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Why did you do that?

152
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I don't like this handbag

153
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Kami-san, I'm sorry

154
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Kami-san, it's wrong

155
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
It's not like Kami-san is thinking in advance

156
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
That's right

157
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
It's a gag

158
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
If you give it to him, Kami-san can do it right away

159
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
That's right

160
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
It's Kami-san

161
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
It's Kami-san

162
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Kami-san, it's okay

163
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Is it okay if I don't say his name?

164
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
It's okay

165
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
It's Kami-san's show

166
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Please

167
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
He's not here

168
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Kami-san

169
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Kami-san

170
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Kami-san

171
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Wait a minute

172
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Kami-san, please

173
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
He's here

174
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Please take care of Kami-san

175
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
This is embarrassing

176
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Kami-san, I'm sorry

177
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
As expected

178
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Kami-san is amazing

179
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Is it okay to say that?

180
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I was waiting for him

181
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Let's do this for the last time

182
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I'll leave it to you

183
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Please

184
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Let's do this for the last time

185
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I got hooked

186
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Am I that?

187
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Kami-san

188
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I'm in trouble

189
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I'm sorry

190
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I didn't bring my ero today

191
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I'm not good at talking

192
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Kami-san

193
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Kami-san's face is really bad

194
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Kami-san, can I change it?

195
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Is it okay?

196
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
That's right

197
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Don't use it

198
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Don't use it

199
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I'll change it at the end

200
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Kami-san will change it at the end

201
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
It's a good sentence

202
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Don't throw it

203
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Don't throw it

204
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I'm sorry

205
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I didn't bring my ero today

206
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Was it hard?

207
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I'm coming to save you

208
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Kami-san

209
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Kami-san

210
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I'm sorry

211
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Kami-san

212
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I'm lonely

213
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
He's trying to do everything

214
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Kami-san

215
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:10,000
It's difficult to use things

216
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Where is Kami-san from?

217
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I'm Kami-san from Machiavelli

218
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Is there a way to end it?

219
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Yes

220
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
For example

221
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
For example

222
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
For example

223
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
That's right

224
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I said it before

225
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
You can use it either way

226
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Goodbye

227
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
That's right

228
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Let's go

229
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Let's get it

230
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Kami-san is still here

231
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Let's end it

232
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Let's end it

233
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I have to go back and take a bath

234
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Kami-san

235
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I don't know

236
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I don't know

237
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
So

238
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Today

239
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Will we meet again in 20 years?

240
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I don't know

241
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
That was good

242
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
That was good

243
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I'm happy

244
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I'm really happy

245
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Well

246
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I'm crying

247
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Please do it again

248
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
What did you say?

249
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
So

250
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Tonight

251
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
In 30 years

252
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I can't do it in 30 years

253
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I can't do it in 20 years

254
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
The way you say it is totally different

255
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I laughed at the end

256
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Have a good day

257
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
That was good

258
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Should we do the last one?

259
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Let's do the last one

260
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Today's talk is over

261
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I'm going home

262
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Why are you going home alone?

263
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
You're the only one left

264
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
You're the only one left

265
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Let's end it here

266
00:12:44,000 --> 00:13:11,000
See you in 20 years
