1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
We don't have enough money for the team project, so let's make some money!

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Wada-san, last week, we spent a lot of money on the opening.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
It was about 5 million yen.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
After all, that happened.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
We don't have any money today.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
We don't have any money.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
It's not that we don't have any money, but let's make some money.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I see.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
You know, on TV, I say that as an idol.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Today, on the table, I have potatoes and bananas.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Today's manager is Okamoto.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Next to me is Noriya from Team Zero.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Next to you is Yamazaki from Team Zero.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Recently, I've been on TV a lot.

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I don't know why I've been on TV so much.

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Everyone, let's eat one by one.

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Let's eat one by one.

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
So, Mio-san.

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Yes, yes.

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
We've already eaten.

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
If you want to do it, please do it here.

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I feel like I'm going to poop.

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
If I poop, the person in charge will come.

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
It's like a hall.

25
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
You can eat it.

26
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
The person in charge will come.

27
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
And...

28
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
But this is a TV show.

29
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I think I can do it.

30
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Really? I can do it, too.

31
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I can do it, too.

32
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
That's funny.

33
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I can't hear anything here.

34
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Wait a minute.

35
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
It's going to come out on the right.

36
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
It's going to come out.

37
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Here we go.

38
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I want you to dance.

39
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Blackpink! Blackpink!

40
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Blackpink! Blackpink!

41
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
If you dance like that, it's not cool.

42
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Blackpink!

43
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Can I do it?

44
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Yes.

45
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Excuse me.

46
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
That's funny.

47
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
It's funny.

48
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:42,000
It's funny.

49
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Blackpink!

50
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
You should do it properly.

51
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
That's funny.

52
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
That's funny.

53
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
He's a big brother.

54
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
That's a great movie.

55
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
That's funny.

56
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I feel good.

57
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
One more time.

58
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
That's funny.

59
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I'm sure it's gonna come out.

60
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Damn it.

61
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Come on.

62
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Come on.

63
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
It's dirty.

64
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
If it comes out, if it comes out.

65
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
That's funny.

66
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
It's funny.

67
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
That's funny.

68
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
That's funny.

69
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
That's funny.

70
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Eat some bananas.

71
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
He's eating bananas.

72
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Eat some bananas.

73
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Eat some bananas.

74
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Damn it.

75
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
That's funny.

76
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Thank you.

77
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I don't have any money, so I gave up.

78
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Thank you very much.

79
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Thank you very much.

80
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
That's funny.

81
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
That's funny.

82
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
You should do it properly.

83
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
You're not a kid anymore.

84
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Okay.

85
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Okay.

86
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Thank you very much.

87
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
That's funny.

88
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I don't like it.

89
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
It's time for a movie.

90
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I don't like it.

91
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I don't like talking.

92
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I've been doing it for years.

93
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I hate this time the most.

94
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
It's hot.

95
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I sweat when I talk.

96
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I'm nervous.

97
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,000
If I go out in thin clothes, I'm worried about my bra.

98
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I'm embarrassed to be seen.

99
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I'm embarrassed to be seen.

100
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I don't like it.

101
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I don't like it if I'm wearing a bra.

102
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I'm like an invitation.

103
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I'm like an invitation.

104
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I'm very high.

105
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Really?

106
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I'm very high.

107
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I'm very high.

108
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I'm very high.

109
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I'm very high.

110
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I'm very high.

111
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I'm very high.

112
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I will work like this for a long time.

113
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
That...

114
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
That...

115
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Yesterday,

116
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
You know the TV show, CX right?

117
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
You know the TV show, CX right?

118
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I went to the bathroom.

119
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I hear a loud noise.

120
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
A noisy one.

121
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
There is also a shocking one too.

122
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
There is also a shocking one too.

123
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
But I краaact to my lower leg, and I jerk it.

124
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
What does it mean?

125
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I went to the bathroom and I was like,

126
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Ah, I pooped and pooped my butt.

127
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I pooped all the time.

128
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:24,000
And I was wearing this Gokugira thing.

129
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
That's pathetic.

130
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,000
It was in the way, so I put it on top of the toilet.

131
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I forgot about it and went out.

132
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I went into the studio once and thought,

133
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Ah, the Gokugira belt.

134
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
When I went back to the toilet, I was like,

135
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Ah, there must be something.

136
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
And Shimura-san was there, right?

137
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Yes, yes.

138
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I went to the bathroom and Shimura-san was taking a dump.

139
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I was taking a dump and saying,

140
00:09:52,000 --> 00:10:01,000
The comedy I was talking about as a kid the other day...

141
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
The comedy I was talking about as a kid the other day...

142
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:10,000
It's not about us, is it?

143
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I'm worried about this.

144
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
It's not true.

145
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
When I asked him, his face was half serious.

146
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
He was half laughing, but he was like,

147
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
What should I do if you tell me?

148
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
What should I do if you tell me?

149
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
It was completely different, wasn't it?

150
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
It was completely different.

151
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I respect Shimura-san.

152
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Why are you laughing there?

153
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I'm in trouble.

154
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I'm making a lot of people nervous.

155
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
In the past, on the Shinkansen,

156
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Sendo, Akiyo,

157
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I met him on the Shinkansen.

158
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I met him on the Shinkansen, and there was a passage.

159
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
The person next to him was that kid.

160
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
He was the same as the manager.

161
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
He was wearing something.

162
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I don't know if he was wearing it because he was a fan.

163
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
He looked sweet.

164
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
He was wearing cream puffs.

165
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
He was wearing cream puffs and sprinkled sugar on them.

166
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I hate that.

167
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
He was eating with his mouth wide open.

168
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
He didn't eat with such a dirty face.

169
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
The manager asked him,

170
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
What do you think, Matsumoto-san?

171
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I'm already cute.

172
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Don't take it.

173
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
That's bad, too.

174
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
What are you talking about?

175
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
He looked sweet.

176
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I don't need such a guy.

177
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
He was sitting next to the window.

178
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I'm worried about him.

179
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
He was looking at me.

180
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
What should I do with this luggage?

181
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
He was carrying a big luggage.

182
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
He was carrying a big luggage.

183
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I thought I had to eat it.

184
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Thank you for the food.

185
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:02,000
It's sweet.

186
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
He didn't drink anything.

187
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
He ate half of it.

188
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Why?

189
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I hate that.

190
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I'm really sorry.

191
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Even if I stay like this,

192
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I'll end up going to Tokyo.

193
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I'll end up going to Tokyo.

194
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I have to do something.

195
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
What did you do?

196
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
When I was about to take a bath,

197
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I went to the bathroom.

198
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Over there?

199
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Over there.

200
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
In the meantime,

201
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I went to the bathroom.

202
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I'm really sorry.

203
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
When I came back,

204
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I was like this.

205
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
It's not good to be late.

206
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
It's not good to be late.

207
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
But if you think about it later,

208
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
it's better to reject it.

209
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
It's better to reject it than to throw it away.

210
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I was like that, too.

211
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I was told by my ex-girlfriend

212
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
to treat me to coffee.

213
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Please wait.

214
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I was treated.

215
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
You're my ex-girlfriend, right?

216
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I don't drink coffee.

217
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I'm a loser.

218
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
It's unusual to treat me to coffee.

219
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I was surprised.

220
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Do you drink coffee?

221
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
You're a loser.

222
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I can't drink coffee,

223
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
but if you say it's okay,

224
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I'll treat you to coffee.

225
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Thank you for the coffee.

226
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I drank it forcibly.

227
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
You're a loser.

228
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I don't drink coffee in front of you.

229
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I can't help it.

230
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I can't help laughing.

231
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
You have the courage to reject it, right?

232
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I can't reject it.

233
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Put it in your ass.

234
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
You're going to marry Nan-chan.

235
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
That's right.

236
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I have to go.

237
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Are you going?

238
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I'm going.

239
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I heard it's 12 o'clock.

240
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
It's about 12 o'clock.

241
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I don't know the time.

242
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
It's about 12 o'clock.

243
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
It's cold.

244
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
That's true.

245
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Don't think it's cold.

246
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I don't think it's cold,

247
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
but if you go,

248
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
you have to celebrate again.

249
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I don't want to celebrate.

250
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
How much money do you make?

251
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I don't want to catch you,

252
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
but I want to see you.

253
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Celebrate.

254
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Think about it.

255
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I think the world is strange.

256
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I'm not going to get married.

257
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I'm not going to get married,

258
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
which means I don't have children.

259
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I can't have children.

260
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I don't get it.

261
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I don't get it.

262
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I don't get it.

263
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I don't get any money for celebrations.

264
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
But I'm married.

265
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
When you get older,

266
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
you'll get it.

267
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
When you get older,

268
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
you'll get it.

269
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Congratulations.

270
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
But I don't have a family.

271
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I don't have a wife or children.

272
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Who's going to do that for me?

273
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I did the worst.

274
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
That's a waste.

275
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I bought it for you,

276
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
and I'm making a lot of money.

277
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Why?

278
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Why?

279
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I bought your wedding.

280
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
That's 26,500,000 yen.

281
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
You're lying.

282
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
You're stupid.

283
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I'm going to kick your ass.

284
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
No, I'm not.

285
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
You're stupid.

286
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
And for the children's celebration,

287
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
that's another...

288
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
You're lying.

289
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
13,400,000 yen.

290
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
What?

291
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Why is it so expensive?

292
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I can't get that money back.

293
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Unless I get married

294
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
or have children.

295
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
You said you'd do it

296
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
when you wear a chan-chan-ko.

297
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
But you wear a chan-chan-ko.

298
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I'll do it again then.

299
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Let's forget about the celebration.

300
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Give it back to me.

301
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Why?

302
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
13,400,000 yen.

303
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
You can't say that.

304
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
25,600,000 yen.

305
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Why?

306
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
And the rest is 3,000 yen.

307
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Give it back to me.

308
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Let's not talk about that.

309
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Let's not talk about that.

310
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
It's not over yet.

311
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Let's wrap it up.

312
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
What?

313
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Nan-chan.

314
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Nan-chan?

315
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:39,000
It's about the size of a human bowl.

316
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
That's not true.

317
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
That's not true.

318
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
That's true.

319
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
That's not true.

320
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
It depends on the person you're dating.

321
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,000
How much is it?

322
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
18,000 yen.

323
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Why?

324
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
It's 10,000 yen.

325
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
It's nothing.

326
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:06,000
It's about 12,500 yen.

327
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
There are a lot of spies in Japan.

328
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I've never heard of it.

329
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
There are a lot of spies.

330
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:19,000
There are a lot of electric products and cars in Japan.

331
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:24,000
There are a lot of spies hiding in places we don't know.

332
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I've never heard of it.

333
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
There are spies.

334
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
There are spies to steal electric products.

335
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
They're supposed to steal electric products.

336
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
They're supposed to steal technology.

337
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
There are a lot of spies in Japan.

338
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Especially in Japan.

339
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Is that so?

340
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:49,000
How do you know that they're spies?

341
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I didn't even know there were spies in many places.

342
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,000
How do you tell them apart?

343
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:01,000
I want everyone to remember this.

344
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
How do you tell them apart?

345
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,000
The first way to tell a spy apart is by looking at their shoes.

346
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Don't act like you don't know anything.

347
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Their shoes...

348
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I'm not a spy, so my shoes are like this.

349
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:23,000
A spy's shoes are like a telephone.

350
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,000
It's obvious. I'm a spy.

351
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
It's obvious.

352
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,000
There are also a lot of underground people.

353
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:40,000
There are 20,000 Japanese people in the underground organization.

354
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Don't say that.

355
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,000
It's hard to tell them apart.

356
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
What kind of people are they?

357
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Underground people have lived underground for a long time.

358
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:58,000
It's hard to tell them apart.

359
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:05,000
The other day, there was a paper in the paper killer's container.

360
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:12,000
There's a sticker on the container's surface.

361
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:18,000
If you do this with a paper killer, the paper on the surface will get wet.

362
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,000
There's a paper here.

363
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
But...

364
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
How do you do that paper?

365
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
This paper?

366
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,000
How do you draw the paper on the paper?

367
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
It's not that hard.

368
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,000
It's hard.

369
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
If there's a paper here...

370
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,000
It's not that hard.

371
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
It's hard.

372
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:52,000
If there's poop in the pants, it's like washing them with a washlet.

373
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,000
I'll give you an example.

374
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
What?

375
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
What is that?

376
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
That's not it.

377
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
There's poop in the pants.

378
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
If there's a paper in the paper killer's container...

379
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:11,000
How do you say that word?

380
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:17,000
If there's poop in the pants, it's like washing them with a washlet.

381
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:22,000
That's not it.

382
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I thought you were saying, ahhh.

383
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
No, that's not it.

384
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,000
This is a mistake, but that's not it.

385
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
What? There's something like this?

386
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
What is this word?

387
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:42,000
If you look at other people's behavior, it's my behavior.

388
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:49,000
It's not like that at all.

389
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
What?

390
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
I don't think we're from the same family.

391
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:00,000
The other day, I found this scribble in the public toilet at the station.

392
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:06,000
It said, I'm dating the super-famous comedian H.M. and I'm getting married this year.

393
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Please don't write me a letter.

394
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
That's you.

395
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Who would write such a lie?

396
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:20,000
You wrote it in the toilet when you said you were getting married.

397
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
You're a great person.

398
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,000
But when you get married, you'll marry your grandma, right?

399
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I will.

400
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Actually, I'm here at this venue today.

401
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Oh, really?

402
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Grandma isn't here, is she?

403
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
I told you, she's not here.

404
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Please come.

405
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Please come.

406
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
You're not in the mood.

407
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
No, no, no.

408
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I can't do anything about that.

409
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
That's you.

410
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Don't you get together early?

411
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:57,000
I'm angry with the teachers who are angry with the people who are gathered at the ceremony.

412
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
That's not true.

413
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:28,000
There was such a thing.
