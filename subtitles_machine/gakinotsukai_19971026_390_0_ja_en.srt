1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
You can't beat me!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hey! Hey! Hey!

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hey! Hey! Hey!

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Hey! Hey! Hey!

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Hey! Hey! Hey!

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Hey! Hey! Hey!

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Hey! Hey! Hey!

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Hey! Hey! Hey!

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Hey! Hey! Hey!

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
This program is brought to you by the following sponsors.

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
This is bad!

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Put it in the bag!

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Put it in the bag!

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Tie it with a rope!

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Tie it with a rope!

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Tie it with a rope!

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Tie it with a rope!

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Hold it!

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
It's stuck!

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
It's stuck!

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
The water is weak!

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
The water is weak!

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
It's stuck!

24
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
A rope! A rope!

25
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
A rope!

26
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I got it!

27
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I got it!

28
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Hey! Hey! Hey!

29
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Hey! Hey! Hey!

30
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Hey! Hey! Hey!

31
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
You're so mean!

32
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
You're so mean!

33
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
You're so mean!

34
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
There are 15 more to see.

35
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
There are 15 more to see.

36
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
This is bad!

37
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Now!

38
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Now!

39
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Now!

40
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Now!

41
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Now!

42
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Now!

43
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Now!

44
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Now!

45
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Now!

46
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Now!

47
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Now!

48
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Here!

49
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Here!

50
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Here!

51
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
The water is weak!

52
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
The water is weak!

53
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
What's wrong?

54
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
What's wrong?

55
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
What's wrong?

56
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
A rope!

57
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
A rope!

58
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Help me!

59
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
This is bad!

60
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
We have to fight back!

61
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
What do we do?

62
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
What do we do?

63
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
We have to run again!

64
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Tanaka!

65
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
If you go that far, you'll get caught!

66
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I can't do it!

67
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
The enemy is pretty much dead.

68
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
But you might not be able to do anything with this.

69
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
You might not be able to do anything.

70
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Damn!

71
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I can't do it.

72
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Are you sure you want to do it?

73
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
5 seconds!

74
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
5 seconds!

75
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Are you serious?

76
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Are you sure you want to do it?

77
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Are you sure you want to do it?

78
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Wait!

79
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Wait!

80
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I can't do it!

81
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Okay!

82
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
It's hot!

83
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
You can do it!

84
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
You're good!

85
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
You're good!

86
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I'm scared!

87
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
He ran away!

88
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
He ran away!

89
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Run!

90
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Run!

91
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
What are you going to do?

92
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Wait a minute!

93
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
He's weakening!

94
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Don't chase him!

95
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Alright!

96
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
You can do it!

97
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
You can do it!

98
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
You can do it!

99
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
He stopped!

100
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
He stopped!

101
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
He stopped!

102
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Wait a minute!

103
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
What are you doing?

104
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
You did it!

105
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
You did it!

106
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
You did it!

107
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
You did it!

108
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
You did it!

109
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Good job!

110
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
What time is it now?

111
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
What time is it now?

112
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
5 minutes and 59 seconds!

113
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
5 minutes and 59 seconds!

114
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Alright!

115
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
You have to do it properly!

116
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I'll do it properly!

117
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Damn!

118
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
What kind of creature is that?

119
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
What kind of creature is that?

120
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
What kind of creature is that?

121
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
What kind of creature is that?

122
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Ladies and gentlemen!

123
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Well...

124
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
What can I say?

125
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Takugai is really energetic, isn't he?

126
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
That's not true!

127
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
That's not true!

128
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
That's not true!

129
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Everyone's in a good mood.

130
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Everyone's in a good mood.

131
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Even if you say that,

132
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Even if you say that,

133
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
this is the last episode of this show.

134
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Why?

135
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Why?

136
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Don't say anything!

137
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I've been listening to your talking about Heisei!

138
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Don't say anything!

139
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I've been listening to your talking about Heisei!

140
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Don't say anything.

141
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
You're so great!

142
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Don't say anything.

143
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
You hate me so much!

144
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
So much that I'm ready to attack you!

145
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
It's you who really likes me!

146
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
It's been a while!

147
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Long time.

148
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
The other guy finally flew out.

149
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
That's right.

150
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
He finally flew out.

151
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
He flew out in a hurry.

152
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
What's so scary about that?

153
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I'm scared.

154
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Is that so?

155
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
You haven't done it.

156
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I don't think I'm scared of anything.

157
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Do you want to do it?

158
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
No, I'm not. I don't mind doing it.

159
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
But I'm a completely unknown man.

160
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
What do you mean?

161
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I'm a very alive man.

162
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Oh, because you're a cowboy?

163
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
That's right.

164
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I can do skydiving.

165
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Oh, really?

166
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
But skydiving is something that people come up with.

167
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I just don't want to do what people come up with.

168
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
So I'll do it if no one else has done it.

169
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
You don't have to do it.

170
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
So when I do it, I don't use a parachute.

171
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Hey, Suga-chan!

172
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I'll do it if you follow me.

173
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I'll do it.

174
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,000
If you'll follow me, I'll do it if you want to see me do it.

175
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I'll do it like this.

176
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
What's that?

177
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
It's like an acrobat.

178
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
The sky is amazing.

179
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
When I say, Matsumoto!

180
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I'll do it like this.

181
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I'll do it like this.

182
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I'll do it like this.

183
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I'll do it like this.

184
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
You'll do it like this.

185
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I'll do it like this.

186
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I'll do it like this.

187
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I'll do it like this.

188
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I'll do it if you want to see me do it.

189
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
But no one else has done it.

190
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
You don't have to do it.

191
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
But then, there's no art.

192
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
So I'll do it like this.

193
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I'll do it like this.

194
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
But while we're talking, everyone's laughing.

195
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
But if you do it, it'll be cold.

196
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I'll do it like this.

197
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I'll do it like this.

198
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I'll do it like this.

199
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I'll do it like this.

200
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I'll do it like this.

201
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I'll do it like this.

202
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I'll do it like this.

203
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
It's hard.

204
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
What's hard?

205
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
It's hard.

206
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
A lot of new shows have started.

207
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
How is it?

208
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,000
It's just that, right? The usual, stylish show on Mondays.

209
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
At 9 o'clock on Monday.

210
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
It's just that, right?

211
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
It's a big number.

212
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
There's nothing else.

213
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
There's nothing else.

214
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
It's just that.

215
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
It's a big number.

216
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
The other day, I thought I'd watch TV.

217
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
But there were only fools.

218
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
A woman reporter went to a good takoyaki shop.

219
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
There were two takoyaki shops.

220
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
There was a line of takoyaki shops.

221
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
A woman reporter went to the takoyaki shop and said,

222
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
It's delicious.

223
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
It's like cream puff.

224
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Are you stupid?

225
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
You're praising food, but you're giving me food.

226
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
You're so naive.

227
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
A more stupid woman saw a beautiful scenery and said,

228
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I want to see a beautiful picture.

229
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
What is that?

230
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
That's crazy.

231
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
What's crazy?

232
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
She's drawing a picture looking at the scenery.

233
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
That's right.

234
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I don't even know which is which.

235
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Don't say that.

236
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
It's like a firefly is shining.

237
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
It's not a good time right now.

238
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
It's like a firefly is shining.

239
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
It's like a firefly is shining.

240
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
It's beautiful.

241
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
It's like a firefly is shining.

242
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
That's right.

243
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
That's good.

244
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
It's exclusive to the drama you just watched.

245
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
That's enough.

246
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
It's already over.

247
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Don't bring it back.

248
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
At this time of the year,

249
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
If you talk about the drama on Fuji TV,

250
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I'm sure you'll talk about it again.

251
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
That's enough.

252
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
That's enough.

253
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I'm following your instructions.

254
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Why?

255
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I'm being controlled by you.

256
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Matsumoto, right.

257
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Matsumoto, right.

258
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Back, back.

259
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I'm just moving.

260
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
What should we do?

261
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Nothing.

262
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Are you exercising?

263
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I am.

264
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
What are you doing in the room?

265
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Are you going to buy a training machine or not?

266
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I've told you this before.

267
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I'm promoting it on Teletalk.

268
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Don't buy it.

269
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I'm telling you it's dangerous.

270
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
It's for your abs.

271
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
It's here.

272
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
It's here.

273
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
It's like a seesaw.

274
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
It's light.

275
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
That's right.

276
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
It's like this.

277
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
It's like this.

278
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
It's like this.

279
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
It's like this.

280
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I'm holding it here with these two points.

281
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
If I do this,

282
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
It's going to shift.

283
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
It's going to be like this.

284
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
It's going round and round.

285
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
If you can go straight up, it's okay to go round.

286
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I need a stopper.

287
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I have to cut the stopper.

288
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
It's not good.

289
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
How much is it?

290
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Mine is 5,800 yen.

291
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
It's cheap.

292
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Why?

293
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Why?

294
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Buy a good one.

295
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I'm going to the gym.

296
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Really?

297
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
You're so cool.

298
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
You're amazing.

299
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
You're going to kill me.

300
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Why?

301
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I'm not going to kill you.

302
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I'm going to the gym.

303
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
You have to move your body.

304
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I'm wearing a bandana.

305
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I'm not wearing a bandana.

306
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I'm wearing a bandana and a t-shirt with a wrinkled sleeve.

307
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
That's a UCLA.

308
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
What kind of impression do you have?

309
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
It's cool.

310
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Do you want to go with me?

311
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
You and I have different basic physical strength.

312
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
We have different quickness.

313
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
What do you mean?

314
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
This quickness.

315
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I have the quickness of a rabbit's brain.

316
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
You're so slow.

317
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
You're so slow.

318
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Please ask Mr. Matsumoto to do the impossible-to-be-possible man.

319
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Yes.

320
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
For one minute, try to make the viewer rate of the program the highest.

321
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
It says impossible-to-be-possible man.

322
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
For one minute.

323
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
It's okay.

324
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
It's not a big deal.

325
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Really?

326
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Please do it.

327
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
It's going to be hard.

328
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
If you raise it every minute, it'll be easier.

329
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
It's okay.

330
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
How high should I raise it?

331
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
If it's for one minute, raise it to 25.

332
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Raise it to 25?

333
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Okay.

334
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I don't know how high it is now.

335
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
From here to 25.

336
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Raise it to 25.

337
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Is 25 okay?

338
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
How high is it now?

339
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
25.

340
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
If you raise it every minute, it'll be easier.

341
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Okay.

342
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Let's start.

343
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Okay?

344
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Okay.

345
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Start!

346
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Hey.

347
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Hey.

348
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
What are you doing?

349
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
You're cheating.

350
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
You're cheating.

351
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
You're cheating.

352
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I'm not cheating.

353
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I'm not saying that you're cheating.

354
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Why don't you stop?

355
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
You said it was 21.

356
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I didn't say that.

357
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
It's starting now.

358
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
What?

359
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
You said it was 21.

360
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I didn't say that.

361
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Really?

362
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
What kind of face did you make?

363
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
What kind of face?

364
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Who are you?

365
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Why don't you stop?

366
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Why don't you stop?

367
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
You've never raised it.

368
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,000
That's why Hamada is a ghost.

369
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
That's right.

370
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
As a producer, that's right.

371
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Since 25 is there,

372
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I can't stop it on purpose.

373
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Who saw it?

374
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
It's going up.

375
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
It's going up.

376
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
It's going up now.

377
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I thought it was going up.

378
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I felt it.

379
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I'm doing it again.

380
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I can't do it anymore.

381
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I can't do it.

382
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
It's going to be like this.

383
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I should have done it.

384
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I don't know.

385
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I was so close.

386
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
But it went up.

387
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Let's see next week.

388
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
How much did it go up?

389
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
It was short.

390
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
It went up 5%.

391
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
It went up 5% before the start.

392
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
1, 2, 3.

393
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I don't know.

394
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
That's it.

395
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
It went up 5% before the start.

396
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Of course.

397
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
It went up.

398
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
If it didn't go up, what should we do?

399
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
What?

400
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Don't be stupid.

401
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Don't be stupid.

402
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
If it didn't go up, what should we do?

403
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Of course it went up.

404
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
If it didn't go up, what should we do?

405
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
What do you mean by what should we do?

406
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:25,000
You have to do something about it.

407
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
You're angry because it went up more than 20%.

408
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Wait a minute.

409
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Is it 5%?

410
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,000
You said it went up 5% before the start.

411
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
You said it didn't go up.

412
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
You said it didn't go up.

413
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
But it went up 5% in that short time.

414
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I didn't say that.

415
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I said it.

416
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
You're so dirty.

417
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
But it definitely went up.

418
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
If it didn't go up, can the staff think about it?

419
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I don't want to see Matsumoto-san's drawing on TV.

420
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I want to do it.

421
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Don't put your butt on it.

422
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
What's so funny about it?

423
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:17,000
What's so funny about it? I contributed to the show.

424
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
If it went down, you'll know the punishment.

425
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
If it went down, you'll know the punishment.

426
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
It doesn't go down.

427
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:33,000
It goes up.

428
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
It does go up.

429
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Why did you put your butt on it?

430
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,000
You said it went up.

431
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
You said it went up.

432
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
You're so dirty.

433
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
It doesn't go down.

434
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
It doesn't go up.

435
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
It goes up.

436
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
It's a matter of whether it goes up or not.

437
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
That was a long time ago.

438
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
It was only a few seconds ago.

439
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Can I see your drawing?

440
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
What do you mean?

441
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I stopped it.

442
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
You stopped it.

443
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Up to here.

444
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Up to here.

445
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Wait a minute.

446
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Why did you put your butt on it?

447
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
That's all.

448
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:24,000
What's the punishment?

449
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
What's the punishment?

450
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
That's enough.

451
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
That's enough.

452
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Stop using the speed.

453
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Stop using the speed.

454
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Stop using the speed.

455
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Stop using the speed.

456
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I can't use the small one, either.

457
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I want to play.

458
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
It's okay.

459
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
It's okay.

460
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Let's think about it.

461
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Everyone, that's all.

462
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
What the hell are you waiting for?

463
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
You are said to be the most important person in the entertainment industry.

464
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:12,000
You are the most important person in the entertainment industry, Matsumoto-san.

465
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
It's Jupiter, right?

466
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:23,000
If you were to propose to your girlfriend's parents, what kind of attitude would you have?

467
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:28,000
It's better to think that this person has a different attitude. It's a good attitude.

468
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
That's for rich people.

469
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
If they find out later, they'll be in trouble.

470
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
That's not true.

471
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
You're still a fool. You're a bonsai.

472
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
A good attitude means that you're a good person.

473
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,000
It's not that you're rich or that you have a piano at home.

474
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
It's your feelings.

475
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I see.

476
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
It's not that your heart is empty. Your heart is a good person.

477
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Understand?

478
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Yes.

479
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
You should tell your parents that.

480
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I see.

481
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
For example, what should I tell them?

482
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
For example, under the word, NOSHI.

483
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
I don't know.

484
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,000
I want an otaku's daughter to marry me. NOSHI.

485
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
NOSHI.

486
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
You're really crazy.

487
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
I'll make you happy, NOSHI.

488
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
You're really...

489
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

490
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
If you can't even do that, then you're NOSHI.

491
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Ouch!

492
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:48,000
After you go home, tell them that my daughter is different.

493
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
In a different sense.

494
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Don't go out with a rich man.

495
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
That's how it is.

496
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
What?

497
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Ever since I went to Thailand.

498
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
And a handkerchief.

499
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
If you can make a handkerchief, then you're NOSHI.

500
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
What kind of school do you go to?

501
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Well, well, well.

502
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Well, well, well.

503
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Well, well, well.

504
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Well, well, well.

505
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I want you to marry me, NOSHI.

506
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
If you get it out, then eat it like this.

507
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Eat it like this.

508
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Do you understand?

509
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
I want it to be big.

510
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I definitely want it to be big.

511
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Without a doubt.

512
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
The parents over there will be convinced.

513
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Convinced.

514
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
How many times do I have to say it?

515
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
I'll say it as many times as I want.

516
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
The younger brother over there will also be convinced.

517
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
The younger brother will say,

518
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Play with me, play with me.

519
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
I'll say, big brother.

520
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
I'm healthy and active, NOSHI.

521
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
The correct answer is,

522
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I don't know, but it was beautiful when I saw it.

523
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Dangerous, dangerous, dangerous.

524
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Put it in, put it in.

525
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Put it in, put it in.

526
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Scary, scary, scary.

527
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Scary, scary, scary.

528
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Scary, scary, scary.

529
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Now, now.

530
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Scary, scary, scary.

531
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
It hurts, it hurts, it hurts.

532
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
It hurts, it hurts, it hurts.

533
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Your face.

534
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Are you serious?

535
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Are you serious?

536
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Are you serious?

537
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Are you checking it properly?

538
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:21,000
There was a strange sound.

539
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
It stopped, it stopped, it stopped.

540
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
It stopped.

541
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Are you serious?

542
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:39,000
It stopped, it stopped, it stopped.

543
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
What kind of creature is this?

544
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:57,000
This program was brought to you by these sponsors.
