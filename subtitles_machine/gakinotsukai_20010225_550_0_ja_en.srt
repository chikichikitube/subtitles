1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
There were a lot of letters sent to this boy by the viewers.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
What kind of letters?

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
There was information that they saw a variety of talents at various places.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Did you see them?

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Yes, I saw them.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
There were a lot of them.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Really?

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
It's 100% fake news.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
That's all.

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
That's right.

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
They introduced that.

12
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
But it's not fake news.

13
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
What is it?

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Which one is it?

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Which one is it?

16
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Shut up.

17
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I want to make fun of your stupidity.

18
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I understand.

19
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Are you heading there first?

20
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I'm heading there first.

21
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Whose letter is it?

22
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Is it the first one?

23
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
The first one is amazing.

24
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
It's the first one.

25
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I like it.

26
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Hello, everyone.

27
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Recently, I often go to a ramen shop called Marunaka.

28
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Surprisingly, the famous musician, Nagamushi Tsuyoshi, is lined up in a long line.

29
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Really?

30
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Nagamushi-san?

31
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Is this real?

32
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Yes.

33
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Let's go.

34
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Let's see if Nagamushi-san is there.

35
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Let's go.

36
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Let's go.

37
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Yes, let's go.

38
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:28,000
This program is provided by the sponsor you are watching.

39
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
It's around here.

40
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Are you standing still?

41
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I'm standing still.

42
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I don't know.

43
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
You didn't change the time, did you?

44
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Even if everyone goes, it's not a big deal.

45
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
If that's the case, Nagamushi-san will be mad today.

46
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I'd like someone to come and see me.

47
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Who?

48
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Endo should go.

49
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Me?

50
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Endo should go.

51
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Endo should go.

52
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I've met Nagamushi-san a couple of times.

53
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Let's negotiate.

54
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I'll go.

55
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I'll go.

56
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I wonder if he's here today.

57
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:22,000
If no one is here, it'll be a mess.

58
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
That's true.

59
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
If no one is here.

60
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
He's late.

61
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
He's late.

62
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
What's that?

63
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
It's been a while.

64
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Should we go see him?

65
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Let's go.

66
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Let's go.

67
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Let's go.

68
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Can't we do something better than this?

69
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I think he's right there.

70
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
There he is.

71
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
There he is.

72
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Huh?

73
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Huh?

74
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Huh?

75
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Huh?

76
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
There's Nagamushi-san.

77
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
It's you.

78
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
It's Nagamushi-san, right?

79
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
What?

80
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
No way.

81
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
He's here.

82
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
He's got a hammer gun.

83
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I can't believe it.

84
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
There's no mistake.

85
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
There's no mistake.

86
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
There's no mistake.

87
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
We're almost there.

88
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
That's right.

89
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Why?

90
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
If you wait like that, you'll stand out.

91
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
That's right.

92
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
That's right.

93
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
That's right.

94
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
What are you doing?

95
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Who is it?

96
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Hello.

97
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Eat this.

98
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
It's amazing, isn't it?

99
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
It's amazing, isn't it?

100
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
It's amazing, isn't it?

101
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
It's amazing, isn't it?

102
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
It's amazing, isn't it?

103
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
If we keep going, we'll meet a lot of people, right?

104
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
We'll meet a lot of people today.

105
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
That's right.

106
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Well, the filming is going to take a long time.

107
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
It's time to wait.

108
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Let's go. Let's go.

109
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Let's go. Let's go.

110
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Where did Endo go?

111
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I was surprised. I was surprised.

112
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I was surprised.

113
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I was very surprised.

114
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I was impressed.

115
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I was impressed.

116
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I asked for a photo.

117
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I was impressed.

118
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I asked for a photo.

119
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
It's amazing.

120
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
It's amazing.

121
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
It's precious.

122
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
It's written as a fool.

123
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
That's right.

124
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
The paper was torn and broken.

125
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
That's right.

126
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
It's lucky.

127
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
It's a big deal if I don't turn over.

128
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Let's move on.

129
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Let's move on.

130
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
It's really amazing.

131
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Wow, that's amazing!

132
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I'm actually wearing it right now

133
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Like this

134
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Yes

135
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:40,000
In my neighborhood, there's a confectionery shop called Tanaka Kuni

136
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
That's what it's called

137
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
A confectionery shop called Tanaka Kuni

138
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
What is he going to do?

139
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
It's a mystery

140
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Where is it?

141
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
There's no one here

142
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
There's no one here

143
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
There's no one here

144
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
But isn't the house nearby?

145
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
If we do this, they might come

146
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
They might come from anywhere

147
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Tanaka

148
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Yes?

149
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
You're Tanaka, right?

150
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I'm Tanaka

151
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Can I take a look?

152
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Yes

153
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I'll go and find out the truth

154
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Yes

155
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I'm sorry

156
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I can't do this

157
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Right?

158
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Tanaka Kuni

159
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
How can they come to a confectionery shop like this?

160
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
There's no way they'll come

161
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
This is totally fake

162
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
There's no sign of them

163
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Huh?

164
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Huh?

165
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Huh?

166
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Huh?

167
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Tanaka Kuni is this big?

168
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
He's really big

169
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
He's big

170
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
He looks cold

171
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Huh? Are you Kuni-san?

172
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Huh?

173
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I think I found something

174
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
It's normal

175
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
It's normal

176
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
He's not completely drunk

177
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
But it's Tanaka Kuni

178
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
It really is

179
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Right?

180
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Kuni-san comes here to do this

181
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Does he come to do the mess in the confectionery shop?

182
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
There's no confectionery shop

183
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Look

184
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
There it is

185
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Isn't that Morning Musume?

186
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Really?

187
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Yes, Morning Musume

188
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
It's no good

189
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
What's going on?

190
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
It's not Nacchi

191
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
It's not Nacchi

192
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
It's not Nacchi

193
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I finally found out

194
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I want Nacchi

195
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I want Nacchi

196
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I came here yesterday, but there's no Nacchi

197
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
There's no Nacchi

198
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Where did you stop yesterday?

199
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Don't joke with me

200
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
It's amazing

201
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
It's on

202
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I found it

203
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
It's here

204
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
It was amazing

205
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
It was

206
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I like Morning Musume

207
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
It was like that

208
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
It's still here

209
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
What?

210
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
It's still here

211
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
It's fine

212
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I think so too.

213
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Rocky has been down for a while.

214
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Yes.

215
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Mountain-san, I saw something incredible.

216
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
What is it?

217
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
What a surprise!

218
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
The field of Sharankyu...

219
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
has been robbed.

220
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
What?

221
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
This is not good.

222
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
What is this?

223
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
This is not good.

224
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Even if you say that,

225
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
it doesn't mean that we will do it again.

226
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
However, the house of a friend has been targeted.

227
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I see.

228
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
What will happen?

229
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
It's a field.

230
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
We can't let it happen.

231
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
It can't be.

232
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Something is approaching.

233
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Is that so?

234
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
You see,

235
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
if such a big car approaches,

236
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
the other side will be wary.

237
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
That's right.

238
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
That's why someone is going to see it.

239
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Who is going to see it?

240
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Who is going to see it?

241
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
It's you.

242
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Thank goodness.

243
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Thank goodness.

244
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
It's you.

245
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
What?

246
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
It's you.

247
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Who is it?

248
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I think it's me.

249
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I think so too.

250
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
The field is...

251
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
It's useless.

252
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
The field is...

253
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Who is going to see it?

254
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Is it Rocky?

255
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Yes.

256
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
It's bad for the field.

257
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Yes, it's bad.

258
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Where is Hamada?

259
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
It's you.

260
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
It's okay.

261
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
It's okay.

262
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I see.

263
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I thought it was you.

264
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Wait.

265
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
This is a lie.

266
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
It's not you.

267
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
No.

268
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
It's not you.

269
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
It's not you.

270
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I'm not lying.

271
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I have a guitar.

272
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Are you sure?

273
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
It's not you.

274
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Wait.

275
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
It's not you.

276
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
It's not you.

277
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
It's really you.

278
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
What?

279
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
You're lying!

280
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I really wanted to see it.

281
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Can I see it?

282
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
That's Mr. Hatake.

283
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
But, but, but...

284
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
You're just playing the guitar.

285
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
That's right.

286
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
What's wrong with playing the guitar?

287
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
It's not wrong at all.

288
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Wait a minute.

289
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
This is an excuse.

290
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
It's an excuse.

291
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
It's an excuse.

292
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
It's an excuse.

293
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
This is an excuse.

294
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
It hurts.

295
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
It hurt.

296
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
It hurt.

297
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
With a guitar neck.

298
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
It hurt.

299
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I found a small branch.

300
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I want you to notice it.

301
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I don't want you to notice it.

302
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I wanted your slippers.

303
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Oh, my God.

304
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Hey, Micah!

305
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I forgot the guitar.

306
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I forgot the guitar.

307
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
You left the perfect game.

308
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
What's wrong?

309
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I forgot the guitar.

310
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Hatake.

311
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I forgot the guitar.

312
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
You have to apologize to the owner of the post.

313
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I almost broke it.

314
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
No, no.

315
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
It was a shocking video.

316
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Did you see it?

317
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I saw it, but I was saying something.

318
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
What did you say?

319
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I said I had a bad tooth.

320
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Did you say that?

321
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
But it's amazing.

322
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
It's 100% 100%.

323
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
It's 100% 100%.

324
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I still have it.

325
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Really?

326
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
It's hard, isn't it?

327
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
It's hard.

328
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
To be honest.

329
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Both of you are looking at it.

330
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I'm looking at it.

331
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
But I'm looking for it.

332
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I can see it.

333
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I want to see it when it comes out.

334
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
It's a fake, isn't it?

335
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I don't know.

336
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Listen to me seriously.

337
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I'm talking to you seriously.

338
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Actually, recently, in a nearby park,

339
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
the father of Ashtag Joe,

340
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Yabuki Joe,

341
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
went out.

342
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
That's it.

343
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
That's it.

344
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
That's it.

345
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
That's it.

346
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I don't believe it.

347
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I don't believe it.

348
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I don't believe it.

349
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I'm looking at it.

350
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Are you looking for it again?

351
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
It's not coming back.

352
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
It's not coming back.

353
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Yabuki Joe will never come back.

354
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
It's a fake.

355
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
It's a talent.

356
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
It's that park, isn't it?

357
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
What?

358
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
It's that park, isn't it?

359
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
What?

360
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
What?

361
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
What?

362
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
It's Yabuki Joe.

363
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
It's Yabuki Joe.

364
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
It's Yabuki Joe.

365
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
It doesn't move at all.

366
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
It doesn't move at all.

367
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Wait a minute.

368
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
The fact that Joe is dressed like that,

369
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
does that mean he's dead?

370
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
The last scene.

371
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
That's right.

372
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
That's right.

373
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
He was dead, wasn't he?

374
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I can't believe it.

375
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
It's a fake.

376
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
It's a fake.

377
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
It's a fake.

378
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
It's a fake.

379
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
It's a fake.

380
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
It's a fake.

381
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
And he forgot to write his name.

382
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
He wrote his name.

383
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
He wrote his name.

384
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
He wrote his name.

385
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
That's right.

386
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
It's not moving at all.

387
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Really?

388
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
It's not moving at all.

389
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
It's dead.

390
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
It's the last scene.

391
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
It's not standing up straight.

392
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
It's cold.

393
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
It's cold.

394
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I was surprised.

395
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
But it's Yabuki Joe.

396
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
There's no doubt about it.

397
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Why is his face like that?

398
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
It's true.

399
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
The position of his face is definitely different.

400
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Yabuki-san.

401
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Yabuki-san.

402
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
He's dead, isn't he?

403
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
He's dead, isn't he?

404
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
No, no, no.

405
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
That's not true.

406
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Joe was there.

407
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Joe was there.

408
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Did you see it?

409
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I saw it.

410
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Did you really see it?

411
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I saw it.

412
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I saw it.

413
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
But that's...

414
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
That's not true.

415
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
It was Joe.

416
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
That's not true.

417
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
The last scene.

418
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
It's not moving at all.

419
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
It's not moving at all.

420
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
It's dead.

421
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
It's not moving at all.

422
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
To be honest, when I change my clothes,

423
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I look at the costumes in the car.

424
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
This is a surprise.

425
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I saw Super Mario

426
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
having fun in the neighborhood.

427
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Super Mario?

428
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I didn't expect Mario to exist.

429
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
No, no, no.

430
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I wonder if he's okay.

431
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I don't know if he's there or not.

432
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I don't know if he's there or not.

433
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
He's having fun.

434
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
He's having fun.

435
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I saw Super Mario

436
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
having fun.

437
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
He's having fun.

438
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I don't know if he's there or not.

439
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
That's true.

440
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Yamasaki is slow.

441
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
He's slow.

442
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Let's go see it.

443
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Let's go see it.

444
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Is that Mario?

445
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
That's Mario.

446
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
That's Mario.

447
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
He fell down.

448
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
That's amazing.

449
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Mamma Mia!

450
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Mamma Mia!

451
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Are you from Okinawa?

452
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Are you from Okinawa?

453
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Mario!

454
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I'm getting tired.

455
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I'm getting tired.

456
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
He's getting tired.

457
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I'm losing my speed.

458
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I'm losing my speed.

459
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I think we are out of the frame.

460
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
We're out of the frame.

461
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
The end.

462
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I'm tired.

463
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I'm tired.

464
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Pan para pan para ara advantages

00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:44,200

00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,680
I know

467
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:47,360
Stop

470
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,920
I'm so excited.

471
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,920
You are excited, right?

472
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,920
You are completely facing me now.

473
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,920
You are completely facing me now.

474
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,920
I just happened to see it.

475
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,920
I'm sure you'll tell me.

476
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,920
I'm sure you'll tell me.

477
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,920
I'm sure you'll tell me.

478
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,920
Shall we change the song?

479
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,920
This one, right?

480
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,920
I've been saying this for 3 weeks now.

481
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,920
I've been saying this for 3 weeks now.

482
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,920
It's a new release.

483
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,920
We need a tempo.

484
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,920
We can't just say everything.

485
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,920
We don't have anything.

486
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,920
It's like you've been slipping before it came out.

487
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,920
It's like you've been slipping before it came out.

488
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,920
Do you have a microphone?

489
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,920
I have to record it.

490
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,920
Next week,

491
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,920
Next week,

492
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,920
That's right.

493
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,920
Can you record this?

494
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,920
Can you record this?

495
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,920
Can you record this?

496
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,920
Why?

497
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,920
I can't do this.

498
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,920
I'm going to record it.

499
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,920
I'm going to record it.

500
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,920
I'll just do it.

501
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,920
What kind of feeling is this?

502
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,920
We don't need to laugh at the device.

503
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,920
Well, that's true.

504
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,920
But I'm looking forward to it.

505
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,920
People who come out with such a device.

506
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,920
People who come out with such a device.

507
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,920
I don't know how much fun it'll be.

508
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,920
It's a device that you can't help but laugh at.

509
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,920
It's a device that you can't help but laugh at.

510
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,920
It's a device that you can't help but laugh at.

511
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:52,920
Matsumoto is Hamada's...

512
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:57,920
Run and get out.

513
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,920
Listen to me!

514
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,920
You should have said that earlier.

515
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,920
Why are you here?

516
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:08,920
I want to run and get out.

517
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:16,920
Matsumoto is Hamada's medicine box.

518
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:25,920
Hamada is Matsumoto's medicine box.

519
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:31,920
Matsumoto's heart's medicine box.

520
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:38,920
When are you going to raise the tempo?

521
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:41,920
You should have raised the tempo from the beginning.

522
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:46,920
Don't start from the lowest part.

523
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:50,920
Matsumoto is Hamada's medicine box.

524
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:53,920
Good!

525
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,920
What is it?

526
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,920
Good!

527
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:58,920
Really?

528
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:02,920
It's easy to sing.

529
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:09,920
Matsumoto is Hamada's medicine box.

530
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:13,920
What is it?

531
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,920
What is it?

532
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:19,920
This time the theme is unity.

533
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:22,920
Please do it.

534
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:33,920
Matsumoto is Hamada's medicine box.

535
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,920
I can't say it.

536
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:38,920
I can't say it.

537
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,920
Make it more difficult.

538
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:43,920
You should have said it.

539
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:46,920
You should have said it.

540
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:49,920
I can't think of it.

541
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,920
You should have said it.

542
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:55,920
I can't think of it.

543
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,920
Can you do it now?

544
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,920
I can do it.

545
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:02,920
I think you can do it.

546
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,920
Let's try it.

547
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:10,920
This is it.

548
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:20,920
I can do it.

549
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:34,920
Matsumoto is Hamada's medicine box.

550
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:40,920
It's difficult to sing.

551
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,920
It's difficult to sing.

552
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:46,920
It's difficult to sing.

553
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:49,920
Can you sing a song?

554
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:52,920
That's better.

555
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:59,920
I will sing a song.

556
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:06,920
Matsumoto is Hamada's medicine box.

557
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:09,920
You change every time.

558
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:14,920
Matsumoto is Hamada's medicine box.

559
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:20,920
Matsumoto is Hamada's medicine box.

560
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,920
I will sing a song.

561
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,920
Matsumoto is Hamada's medicine box.

562
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:28,920
I don't know.

563
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,920
Matsumoto is Hamada's medicine box.

564
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:35,920
I don't know.

565
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:38,920
Matsumoto is Hamada's medicine box.

566
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:42,920
I sing a song.

567
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:50,920
I sing a song.

568
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:51,920
Omanoena

569
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:54,920
De-he-he-he-he, Oman

570
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:58,920
Demen-men, Omanoena

571
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,920
Nakana-kana

572
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,920
Nakana-kana

573
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,920
Let's decide on that

574
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:17,920
De-he-he-he-he, Oman

575
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:21,920
De-he-he-he-he, Oman

576
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:26,920
Demen-men, Omanoena

577
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:28,920
Demen-men

578
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,920
Not yet!

579
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,920
You're taking too long

580
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,920
You don't even know the grammar

581
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:41,920
I'll start from here

582
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:47,920
De-men-men, Omanoena

583
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,920
Nakana-kana

584
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:56,920
That's a difficult one

585
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,920
That's a difficult one

586
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,920
I want you to do this

587
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:01,920
Can I?

588
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,920
Let's record it

589
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:06,920
Is everyone okay?

590
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:07,920
Are you okay?

591
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,920
I can't do that many times

592
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,920
De-he-he-he-he, Oman

593
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,920
Let's change the grammar

594
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:18,920
De-he-he-he-he, Oman

595
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:23,920
De-he-he-he-he, Oman

596
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:29,920
Demen-men, Omanoena

597
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,920
Nakana-kana

598
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:41,920
De-men-men, Omanoena

599
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,920
Nakana-kana is too fast

600
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:53,920
Nakana-kana reminds me of my school trip

601
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,920
I was there

602
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,920
You guys are so stupid

603
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,920
This is difficult

604
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:05,920
I got it, I'll do it in ad-lib

605
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,920
Follow me

606
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,920
Try it next time

607
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,920
Let's do it

608
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,920
De-he-he-he

609
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:32,920
De-ha-mo-ha

610
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:44,920
De-ha-mo-ha

611
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:57,920
At the end of the ad-lib, you were clearly pinching your nipples

612
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:02,920
It's okay, it's recorded

613
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,920
It's okay to listen to it

614
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:05,920
Really?

615
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:10,920
Next week, we'll listen to it

616
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:11,920
I see

617
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:30,920
Next week, we'll listen to it
