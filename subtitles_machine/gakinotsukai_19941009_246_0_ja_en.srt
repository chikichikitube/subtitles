00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,700
This program is brought to you by the sponsor.

00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:31,700
Good morning sensei

Please give me a lot of these

7
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,700
Please look at various things

8
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:39,700
Sensei, this is your arm

9
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:40,700
Ah, that's right

10
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:41,700
Good morning

11
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:42,700
Good morning

Please

15
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:47,700
Sensei

16
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:48,700
What?

17
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:50,700
Ah, stop it

18
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:54,700
Sensei

19
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:56,700
What kind of play is this?

20
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:57,700
Ah, this is...

21
00:00:58,700 --> 00:00:59,700
He's saying it over and over

22
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:00,700
This is good

23
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:01,700
Okay, okay

24
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:04,700
Ah, the part of the fish is...

25
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:06,700
It's melting

26
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:08,700
As a man with glasses

27
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:09,700
It's melting

28
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:13,700
Mr. Ishii

29
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:14,700
When did you get here?

30
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,700
Ah, the dining table is ready

31
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:18,700
What would you like to eat?

32
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:19,700
I'm hungry

33
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:20,700
This is good

34
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:21,700
Ah, that's good

35
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:24,700
This is the best

36
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:26,700
Hey, wait a minute

37
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:30,700
Here you go

38
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:31,700
Here you go

39
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:32,700
Ah, this is good

40
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:33,700
I'm also...

41
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:35,700
I feel like I'm running out of energy

42
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,700
Isn't this physical strength?

43
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:38,700
The inside is raw

44
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:42,700
Even if you say the inside is raw

45
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:44,700
It's crispy

46
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,700
It's the taste of Koya

47
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:47,700
Okay

48
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:51,700
Miss

49
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:52,700
This is good

50
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:53,700
This is good

51
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:54,700
This is good

52
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:55,700
It's expensive

53
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:56,700
It's expensive

54
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:57,700
It's expensive

55
00:01:58,700 --> 00:01:59,700
I'll take this

56
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:00,700
Wait

57
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:02,700
Stop it

58
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:04,700
Okay

59
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:05,700
Wait

60
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:08,700
I'll take this

61
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:09,700
I'll take this

62
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:10,700
This is good

63
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:11,700
No

64
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:14,700
Wait, what is this?

65
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,700
It's like an art

66
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,700
I'll pour the soup

67
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:21,700
Ah, this is good

68
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:22,700
This is good

69
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:23,700
This is good

70
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,700
Ah, this is good

71
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,700
What is the purpose of this?

72
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:28,700
What is the purpose of this?

73
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:29,700
What's the purpose of this?

74
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,700
What's the purpose of this?

75
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:34,700
This is a tenderloin

76
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,700
The teacher is proud of this

77
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:38,700
I'm eating this?

78
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,700
Please eat

79
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:41,700
Ah, this is good

80
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:44,700
I'm doing something useless

81
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:46,700
Ah, you're eating

82
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,700
Eat it while it's hot.

83
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:51,700
What flavor is this?

84
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:52,700
It's winter.

85
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,700
I'm sorry.

86
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:55,700
It's winter.

87
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:56,700
It's not sweet.

88
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:57,700
It's not sweet.

89
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,700
It's not sweet.

90
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:00,700
What?

91
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:01,700
This is good.

92
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,700
I bought this in New York.

93
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:04,700
This is important.

94
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:05,700
I bought this in New York.

95
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:06,700
Stop.

96
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,700
This is important.

97
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,700
I bought this in New York for the first time.

98
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:13,700
This is good.

99
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,700
I gave it to you.

100
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:16,700
This is good.

101
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:17,700
Special service.

102
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,700
I'll eat it with rice balls.

103
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,700
You can eat it as it is.

104
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:23,700
You can eat it as it is.

105
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,700
It's not cooked yet.

106
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,700
It's not cooked yet.

107
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,700
It's still sticky.

108
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,700
It's still sticky.

109
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:33,700
It's still like eggplant.

110
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,700
It's like eggplant.

111
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,700
Please eat it.

Please eat it.

114
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,700
You can put any sauce you want.

115
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:45,700
You can put any sauce you want.

116
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,700
Yes.

117
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,700
It looks delicious.

118
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,700
It's good.

119
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:53,700
I'm a bit shy.

120
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,700
It looks delicious.

121
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,700
It looks delicious.

122
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,700
I'm full.

123
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,700
I can't eat it.

124
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,700
I can't eat it.

125
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,700

You're saying woo-hoo.

130
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,700
Shut up.

131
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:21,700
I'm getting excited.

132
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:23,700
I'm getting excited.

133
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,700
No.

Please hold it.

138
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:35,700
Please hold it.

How is it good?

143
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:49,700
It's good.

144
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:51,700
The color is beautiful.

145
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,700
Let's eat it with udon.

146
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,700
Let's eat it with udon.

147
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,700
It's good.

148
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,700
It's like eggplant.

149
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,700
It's good.

150
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,700
It looks delicious.

151
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,700
Look.

This is the best.

156
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:21,700
It's like Naruto.

157
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,700
Do you want some soup?

158
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,700
Yes.

159
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,700

166
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:43,700
I'm going to take off my hat.

167
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,700
I'm going to take off my hat.

168
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,700
Wait a minute.

169
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,700
Wait a minute.

170
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:57,700
It's dirty.

171
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,700
It's dirty.

172
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,700
It's okay to do it with socks.

173
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,700
It's okay to do it with socks.

174
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:05,700
Do you want to do it with socks?

175
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,700

181
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,700
I went to the bathroom a lot.

182
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,700
I have courage.

183
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:29,700

I have to take it off.

189
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:45,700
I have to take it off.

190
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:49,700

197
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,700
I'm sorry.

198
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,700
I'm sorry.

199
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,700
Sorry.

200
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,700
Let's move on.

201
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:23,700
Let's move on.

202
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,700
Let's move on.

203
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:27,700
Let's move on.

204
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:29,700
Let's move on.

205
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,700
Let us move on.

206
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:35,700
Let us move on.

207
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,700
Let's move on.

208
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:41,700
Let us move on.

209
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:43,700
Let us move on.

210
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:45,700
Let us move on.

211
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:47,700
Oh, really?

212
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,700
I just woke up.

213
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,700
I was eating soba noodles!

214
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,700
If you eat soba noodles, you'll wake up!

215
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,700
If you eat soba noodles,

216
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,700
that means you're driving on the road,

217
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,700
and you're breaking the bridge.

218
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:01,700
I woke up,

219
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:03,700
ate soba noodles right away,

220
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,700
and you woke me up to eat soba noodles!

221
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:09,700
My body is already moving.

222
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,700
I'm walking.

223
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,700
I'm not walking.

224
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:15,700
I'm in the car.

225
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,700
Don't say things like a chaos button.

226
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,700
Do you guys know what a chaos button is?

227
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,700
You guys are close.

228
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,700
I'm in the car, but I'm walking up.

229
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:29,700
Why are you pulling me?

230
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:31,700
Why are you pulling me?

231
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:33,700
I'm screaming.

232
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:35,700
I'm in the car, but I'm walking up.

233
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,700
Shut up. Don't say things like that.

234
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,700
It's you.

235
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,700
I'm walking.

236
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,700
I don't know if I'm walking or not.

237
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:45,700
Did you see that?

238
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,700
Why don't you do this show on a live show?

239
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,700
What?

240
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:57,700
It's all nonsense.

241
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:59,700
I'm scared.

242
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,700
Yesterday,

243
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,700
I did a behind-the-scenes show.

244
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:05,700
You did it live.

245
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,700
I'm scared. I don't know what you're going to say.

246
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:09,700
I'm not scared at all.

247
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,700
You said you're from the Ra clan.

248
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,700
I can't say anything about the Ra clan.

249
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,700
People in the industry

250
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,700
are like that.

251
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:21,700
They're always

252
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,700
nervous.

253
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,700
They're always careful about what they say on the air.

254
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:27,700
For example,

255
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,700
a father, a mother, a grandfather, a grandmother.

256
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,700
Family.

257
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,700
That's a misunderstanding.

258
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,700
No, no.

259
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,700
I said I'm from the Ra clan.

260
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,700
I'm from the family.

261
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:41,700
I take off my clothes.

262
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,700
I'm from the Ra clan.

263
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,700
If you take off your clothes,

264
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:47,700
you're not equal.

265
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,700
If you go to the hot spring with your family,

266
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:51,700
you're from the Ra clan.

267
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,700
No.

268
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,700
I'm wearing clothes on the way.

269
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,700
That's your family.

270
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,700
No.

271
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,700
You can't say that.

272
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,700
The Ra clan is naked on the way.

273
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:05,700
No.

274
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,700
When you take a bath, you're from the Ra clan.

275
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:09,700
That's strange.

276
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,700
That's just a normal family.

277
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,700
No, that's stupid.

278
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,700
And if you take off your clothes

279
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,700
in the middle of the show,

280
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,700
they'll say,

281
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,700
you can take off your clothes.

282
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,700
You can't say that.

283
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,700
I'm just wearing my clothes.

284
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,700
I just said that during the commercial.

285
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,700
Even during the commercial,

286
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,700
you can't say that.

287
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,700
I'm just saying it.

288
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,700
I'm just saying it.

289
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:41,700
I don't care.

290
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,700
I don't care.

291
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,700
I'm not an adult anymore.

292
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,700
If you're watching this,

293
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,700
you're from the family.

294
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:51,700
If you're watching this,

295
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,700
you're in elementary school.

296
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,700
You're the same age as Hanaman Hajirau.

297
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:57,700
16 years old.

298
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,700
You're in your 16th grade.

299
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,700
When you're watching this,

300
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,700
if you're told that,

301
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:05,700
you don't like it.

302
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,700
You don't like it.

303
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,700
When you're told that

304
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:13,700
in front of your parents.

305
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:15,700
The atmosphere changes.

306
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:17,700
The atmosphere changes.

307
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,700
I'm telling you to think about it.

308
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,700
I'm telling you more.

309
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:23,700
I'm not telling you anything.

310
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,700
I'm telling you to take off your underwear.

311
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:27,700
I said to take off my underwear.

312
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:31,700
Don't say things like that.

313
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,700
Why?

314
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,700
Take off your underwear.

315
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,700
I'm playing baseball.

316
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,700
Take off your underwear.

317
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,700
That's the momentum.

318
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,700
I can be on the air,

319
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,700
but you can't be on the air.

320
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,700
That's not true.

321
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:51,700
It's scary. It's not scary at all.

322
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:53,700
Editing is scary.

323
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,700
What's scary?

324
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,700
It changes completely.

325
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:01,700
Harada is a monster of editing.

326
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:03,700
Really?

327
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:05,700
Sometimes it's good for you.

328
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,700
He changes people's characters.

329
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,700
Akisai.

330
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,700
He's really good at editing.

331
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,700
Really?

332
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,700
You know.

333
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,700
I talk to him at home

334
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:21,700
and laugh at him.

335
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,700
I take that kind of thing.

336
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,700
I really laugh at him.

337
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:27,700
I keep that part.

338
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,700
Only that part.

339
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,700
I got it.

340
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,700
I don't say who it is,

341
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,700
but there's a guy who says something that can't be helped.

342
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,700
Something that can't be laughed at.

343
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,700
After he says that,

344
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,700
I'll give him this.

345
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,700
Is it funny?

346
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,700
At the scene.

347
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,700
This is the reality.

348
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,700
This is the reality.

349
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:57,700
Where are you looking at?

350
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,700
I was looking at something else.

351
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,700
Wow, that's amazing.

352
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:03,700
And when I look at you.

353
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,700
Give me a break.

354
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,700
That's really bad.

355
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:11,700
That's dirty.

356
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,700
Why?

357
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:15,700
I'm editing what I've built up so far.

358
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,700
I'm changing it.

359
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,700
This is edited and brought here.

360
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,700
I'll cut it like this.

361
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,700
Cut here.

362
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,700
Cut here.

363
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,700
Cut here.

364
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:29,700
And it doesn't have to be there.

365
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,700
It doesn't have to be there.

366
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,700
But it looks natural to the general public.

367
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,700
But it looks natural to the general public.

368
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:39,700
That's right.

369
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:41,700
But it doesn't look like it's getting excited.

370
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,700
But it doesn't look like it's getting excited.

371
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:45,700
What I don't like about it

372
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,700
is that

373
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,700
there are a lot of cowardly things.

374
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,700
What do you mean?

375
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:53,700
Like animals.

376
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,700
And food.

377
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:57,700
Children.

378
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:59,700
But what is the most cowardly thing?

379
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,700
Is there anything else?

380
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,700
There is.

381
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:05,700
What is it?

382
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,700
A plush toy.

383
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:09,700
You're trying to tickle the child's heart a little.

384
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,700
You're trying to tickle the child's heart a little.

385
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,700
You want to wear a plush toy yourself.

386
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:15,700
That's fine.

387
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,700
That's fine.

388
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,700
But you'll get a face.

389
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,700
But that's the opposite.

390
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:23,700
You're trying to tickle the child's heart a little.

391
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,700
You want to wear a plush toy yourself.

392
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:27,700
You're trying to tickle the child's heart a little.

393
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,700
You're trying to tickle the child's heart a little.

394
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,700
You know,

395
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:33,700
I do a dog costume on a TV show.

396
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,700
I'll get a face.

397
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,700
When I see that,

398
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:39,700
no one thinks the child is a dog.

399
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,700
Do you know that?

400
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:43,700
But if you don't show your face,

401
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,700
you'll look like a dog.

402
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:47,700
You'll be a little cute and a little cheeky.

403
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:49,700
You know that, right?

404
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,700
You'll be a little self-conscious.

405
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,700
That's not really...

406
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,700
I'm self-conscious?

407
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:01,700
I'm wild.

408
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:07,700
Wild people don't have ears.

409
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:13,700
I'm wild.

410
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,700
Really.

411
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,700
You have to do it properly.

412
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:19,700
What kind of pose is that?

413
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:21,700
I can't do it.

414
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:23,700
I can't do it.

415
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:25,700
You're pissing me off!

416
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,700
What?

417
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:29,700
What is this?

418
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,700
This is pissing me off?

419
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:33,700
I'm sorry.

420
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,700
I'm talking to someone.

421
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,700
I'm talking to Victory.

422
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:43,700
I'm talking to Victory.

423
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:49,700
I'm sorry.

424
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,700
It's okay.

425
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,700
Please write it down.

426
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,700
Why do dogs always say,

427
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,700
ha ha?

428
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,700
They don't say ha ha

429
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:07,700
so much that it makes you feel sick.

430
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,700
First of all,

431
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,700
I'm alive.

432
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:13,700
I'm alive now.

433
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:15,700
We're friends.

434
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,700
I don't need friends.

435
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:19,700
I want to show my face.

436
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,700
You like to show your face, don't you?

437
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:25,700
I want to show my face.

438
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,700
At that time,

439
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:29,700
I have to say something.

440
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,700
Isn't it okay to say one?

441
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,700
I can't do it.

442
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,700
So,

443
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,700
I'm alive.

444
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,700
I'm breathing.

445
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,700
When I think about it,

446
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,700
when I think of 50 sounds,

447
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:45,700
I can only say ha ha.

448
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,700
Oh, my God.

449
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,700
Oh, my God.

450
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:51,700
I can't do it.

451
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:53,700
If that's the case,

452
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:55,700
talk to me.

453
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:57,700
I can't do it.

454
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,700
Oh, my God.

455
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:01,700
It's strange, isn't it?

456
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:03,700
I can only say ha ha.

457
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:05,700
Ha ha.

458
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:07,700
Ha ha.

459
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:09,700
Talk to me.

460
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,700
I can't do it.

461
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:13,700
I can't do it.

462
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,700
I can't do it.

463
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,700
I can't do it.

464
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:19,700
I can't do it.

465
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:21,700
Ha ha.

466
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:23,700
Ha ha.

467
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,700
I can't do it.

468
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:27,700
I can't do it.

469
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,700
I can't do it.

470
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,700
I can't do it.

471
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:33,700
I can't do it.

472
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,700
I can't do it.

473
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,700
I can't do it.

474
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:39,700
Oh, my image.

475
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,700
I can't do it.

476
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:43,700
I can't do it.

477
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:45,700
I can't do it.

478
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,700
I can't do it.

479
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:51,700
So,

480
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:53,700
I thought a lot,

481
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,700
and tried various things.

482
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:59,700
And that's why my mother was the one to calm down the most.

483
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:07,700
Why is the top and bottom of the newspaper all jagged?

484
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,200
The newspaper is jagged, isn't it?

485
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,700
The top and bottom.

486
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:17,700
Does that mean there are other uses for it besides the newspaper?

487
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:20,700
What do you mean there are other uses for it besides the newspaper?

488
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:23,700
If you listen carefully, you'll understand.

489
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,700
I don't know, I don't know.

490
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:28,700
Even if you suddenly look like an idiot, you won't understand.

491
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:31,200
If you listen carefully, you'll understand.

492
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,700
What do you mean?

493
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,700
Why are you getting on my nerves?

494
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,700
That's what's getting on my nerves.

495
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:41,700
Please stop this.

496
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:42,700
This is what's getting on my nerves.

497
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,700
This is what's getting on my nerves.

498
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:46,700
It means there's a meaning to it while you're reading it.

499
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:48,700
Shut up, you're annoying.

500
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:50,700
Listen carefully.

501
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:53,700
This is my job, isn't it?

502
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:56,700
Even if you understand that, shut up.

503
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,700
This is strange.

504
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:00,700
Is there a meaning to it while you're reading it?

505
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:06,700
Have you ever read the newspaper while you're on the train?

506
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,700
I've read it like this.

507
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:14,700
When you're looking at it, the person holding the newspaper is trying to steal it.

508
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:15,700
You do that, right?

509
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:20,700
It's dangerous if you get any closer to the person holding the newspaper.

510
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:26,700
Why did the bear in the forest tell the young lady to run away?

511
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:34,700
He told her to run away and immediately picked up the earring and chased the young lady.

512
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:38,700
Why did the bear tell the young lady to run away as soon as he saw her?

513
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:42,700
I know that the young lady told him to run away, but there must be something before that.

514
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:44,700
Otherwise, he wouldn't have told her to run away.

515
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,700
One day, in the forest...

516
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:47,700
He met the bear, right?

517
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:49,700
He met the bear on the road to the flowering forest.

518
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:50,700
This is fine.

519
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:51,700
Yes, yes, yes.

520
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:52,700
According to what the bear said...

521
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:53,700
Young lady, run away.

522
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:54,700
This is strange.

523
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:55,700
No, that's not it.

524
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:58,700
I don't know if that's number two or not.

525
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:00,700
I don't even know if that's number three.

526
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,700
If there was nothing between them, he wouldn't have told her to run away.

527
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,700
No, but that's not it.

528
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:08,700
From number two, suddenly, one day, in the forest...

529
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:09,700
No, that's not it.

530
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:13,700
If that's number one and number three is number three, there must be something in number two.

531
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:14,700
What do you mean by that?

532
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:17,700
Does that mean there's something in there?

533
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:21,700
What do you mean there's something in there?

534
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:22,700
What, what, what?

535
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:23,700
Number two is right.

536
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:28,700
Who are you?

537
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:31,700
I'm not joking or anything.

538
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:35,700
When I was a kid, the bear was a bear.

539
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:38,700
It has a little human heart, but it's a bear after all.

540
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,700
So run away quickly.

541
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:41,700
I'm going to eat you.

542
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:44,700
I'm going to eat you.

543
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:49,700
Is it such a deep song?

544
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:52,700
One day, in the forest, you met a bear, right?

545
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:56,700
On the way to the flowering forest, you met a bear.

546
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:58,700
That's as far as you can go.

547
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:01,700
But the bear will follow you later.

548
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:04,700
That means you're going to bring a spear.

549
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,700
What the bear says is, Miss, run away.

550
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:11,700
Stacola-sa-sa-sa, Stacola-sa-sa-sa.

551
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:16,700
Who is this Stacola-sa-sa-sa?

552
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:19,700
I think it's a young lady.

553
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:22,700
I'm saying it's a young lady, but it's a Stacola-sa-sa-sa.

554
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:27,700
It's a little weird to say run away.

555
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:30,700
What, what, what?

556
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:31,700
Wait a minute.

557
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,700
Miss, wait a minute.

558
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:41,700
A fallen thing, a white shell, a small arrow.

559
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,700
Thank you, Mr. Bear.

560
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:51,700
Let's sing in gratitude.

561
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:56,700
This woman has a lot of knowledge.

562
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:57,700
Let's sing in gratitude.

563
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:02,700
How many songs do you have?

564
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:07,700
All of Komote's songs are weird.

565
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:10,700
It's weird, isn't it?

566
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:12,700
I'm addicted to the pond.

567
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:13,700
It's hard.

568
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:15,700
Hello.

569
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:17,700
I'm telling you it's hard.

570
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,700
Help me.

571
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:20,700
It's weird, isn't it?

572
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:24,700
And there was something weird about Doremi's song.

573
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:39,700
It's weird, isn't it?

574
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:40,700
It's weird.

575
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:58,700
It's weird, isn't it?

576
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:03,700
Why is Moominpappa wearing a silk hat instead of clothes?

577
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:06,700
But isn't everyone wearing clothes?

578
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:10,700
Non-non's brother is wearing it.

579
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:12,700
I don't know.

580
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:15,700
They don't have to wear anything.

581
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,700
It's a simple story.

582
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:22,700
If you don't wear a silk hat, you can't distinguish yourself from Moomin.

583
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:26,700
And I don't have this.

584
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:29,700
In the past, my father didn't wear a silk hat.

585
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:32,700
My mother was very mistaken about Moomin and my father.

586
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:37,700
My mother wanted Moomin.

587
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:39,700
I don't know.

588
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:40,700
I'm a fool.

589
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:43,700
My mother said,

590
00:23:43,700 --> 00:24:02,700
I'm Moomin.
