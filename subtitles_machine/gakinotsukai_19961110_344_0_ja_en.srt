1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
This is the 5th episode of Gaki no Tsukai Arai, Tsukitsugi! World's Peaceful! Narikiri Omiya-I!

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
5th episode?

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
It's an unbelievable story today.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Well, let's do it.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I wonder what it is.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
All the Japanese people are like this when it comes to peace.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
World's Peaceful is running on the road of peace.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Saito Director 41 years old.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
No one can stop the passion for marriage that rises as much as it is shaken.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
What kind of peace will challenge a new match?

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Well, today, Mr. Yamazaki.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Yes.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Please tell us about the progress.

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Yes, I understand. Today, we have three wonderful guests.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Toppata!

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
What's going on?

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
It's fast.

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I've told you before, but it's not a small story.

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Please give us a little time.

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Just a little.

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Please.

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
This program is provided by the sponsor you are watching.

24
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Mr. Yamazaki.

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Yes.

26
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Please introduce the first person.

27
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Yes, let me introduce the first person.

28
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Yes.

29
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Today, I ate something a little strong.

30
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I ate fried chicken and rice balls.

31
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
What?

32
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Saito.

33
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
What is that?

34
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Saito.

35
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
That's great.

36
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Oh, hello.

37
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Thank you very much.

38
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
It's very expensive.

39
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Yes.

40
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
But you are a university student, aren't you?

41
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Yes.

42
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Aren't there any people around you?

43
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Well, I'm tired of it.

44
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Yes.

45
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
It's amazing that there are so many young men these days.

46
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I see.

47
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Yes, yes, I understand.

48
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Well, that doesn't mean it's new.

49
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
But you were born in the 29th year of the Showa era, weren't you?

50
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Yes, I was born in the 29th year of the Showa era.

51
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Well, since I was eight years old, I've been working in a barbershop.

52
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
It's hard.

53
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Well, let's watch the video.

54
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Yes.

55
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Aoyama.

56
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
That's good.

57
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
That's good.

58
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Oh, it's really hard.

59
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
It's really hard.

60
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Wait a minute.

61
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
It's really cool.

62
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
But your legs are short.

63
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Your legs are short.

64
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
What's wrong with your legs?

65
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
It's light.

66
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
It's light.

67
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Your legs are short.

68
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Wow.

69
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Wow.

70
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
This is awesome.

71
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Their faces are like real ones.

72
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
They look like real ones.

73
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
They look like real ones.

74
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
That's right.

75
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
They look like real ones.

76
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
They look like real ones.

77
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Wow, they look like real ones.

78
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I forgot about the newspaper.

79
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I forgot about the newspaper.

80
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
It's coming, it's coming.

81
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
It would have been better if it was wider.

82
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
It's like a sausage.

83
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Ah, it's not that you can see it all the time.

84
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Sometimes it's like this.

85
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
It's like a sausage in a convenience store.

86
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Oh, that's nice.

87
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Ah, it's coming, it's coming.

88
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
It's coming.

89
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
That, that, that.

90
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
That, that, that.

91
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
That's right, that's right.

92
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
It's because it's in.

93
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
It's because it's in.

94
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
It's because it's in.

95
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
In my case, I can't use too much force.

96
00:03:47,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I'm going to

97
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I'm going to

98
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I'm going to

99
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I'm going to

100
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
after that, like this...

101
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
That's right, like that.

102
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Wonderful.

103
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
That was wonderful.

104
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
This one's pretty good, though.

105
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Hey.

106
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Ah, sorry.

107
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Ah, sorry.

108
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I think the audience,

109
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
are really surprised by the loss all of a sudden.

110
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
That's right.

111
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
There are theme songs.

112
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Right.

113
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Right.

114
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I want to look cool today.

115
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I see.

116
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
What do you think of me today?

117
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Who are you asking?

118
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
My girlfriend.

119
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Your girlfriend?

120
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
What do you think of me today?

121
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
You looked a bit like a monkey, but it was wonderful.

122
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Right?

123
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
It was nice.

124
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:29,000
But out of all the ones I've done, you were the best.

125
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Thank you very much.

126
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
All right. Please wait a moment.

127
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Thank you very much.

128
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Sayaka, what about you?

129
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I like people who eat things clean.

130
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Heipo failed.

131
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Well...

132
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
How was it?

133
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I'm sure you can tell by the tone of my voice.

134
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Well...

135
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I've been told by my parents a lot today.

136
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
No way.

137
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
How can you talk to your parents about this?

138
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Next, I have a girlfriend.

139
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I see.

140
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I have ten Ashis now.

141
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I didn't like one of them recently, so I cut off one of them.

142
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
You came looking for the tenth Ashis?

143
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Yes, I came looking for the tenth Ashis.

144
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
You're not Ashis!

145
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
But I'm playing with Ashis, so I want to have a serious relationship with her.

146
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Here you go!

147
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Here you go.

148
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Nice to meet you.

149
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Hello.

150
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Please come over here.

151
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Are you a fan of Anri?

152
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Yes, I am.

153
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Nice to meet you.

154
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Miss!

155
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
No, I'm not.

156
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
But you have a girlfriend, don't you?

157
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I have a lot of friends.

158
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
You have friends?

159
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Yes, I have friends.

160
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
You have a lot of friends.

161
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I have a lot of friends.

162
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Ashis asked you about the tenth Ashis, didn't he?

163
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Yes, he did.

164
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
How about you?

165
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Well...

166
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I don't really listen to him.

167
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
You have a girlfriend?

168
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Yes, I have a lot of friends.

169
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Then, please come over here.

170
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
This is great!

171
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Heipo!

172
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
You're good!

173
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
This feels good!

174
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
This feels bad!

175
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
This feels bad!

176
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I don't know if I can do it or not.

177
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
This feels bad!

178
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
He's looking at you!

179
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
He's looking at you!

180
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
He's looking at you!

181
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
He's looking at you!

182
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
He's looking at you!

183
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
He's looking at you!

184
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
He's looking at you very much!

185
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
You did it!

186
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
You did it!

187
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
This is great!

188
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
This is great!

189
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
This is amazing!

190
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
This is amazing!

191
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Hello, this is HEPPO.

192
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
HEPPO-SAN!

193
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:22,500
Yes?

194
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,000
Wonderful!

195
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
He liked it.

196
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I got it!

197
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Thank you very much.

198
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
This is more amazing than the first time.

199
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Thank you very much.

200
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Is the third time okay?

201
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
It's okay.

202
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I have a question.

203
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
It's almost Christmas, isn't it?

204
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Yes.

205
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Are you thinking about something?

206
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I'd like to be with you.

207
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Yes.

208
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Other than that?

209
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Me?

210
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I'd like to see my parents.

211
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I'd like to go to my parents' home town.

212
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Really?

213
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
That's unexpected.

214
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I'd like to see them.

215
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
How long have you been single?

216
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
It's been about 20 years.

217
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Yes, it's been about 20 years.

218
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Really?

219
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
It's been a long time since I had a girlfriend.

220
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I had a girlfriend about a year ago.

221
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:22,000
The other day, I officially became the vice president of an office company.

222
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
What an annoying man!

223
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,000
That's because I'm the wife of the vice president.

224
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I think it's a privilege.

225
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Let's go!

226
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Please make your judgment!

227
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,000
You're lying!

228
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I thought I could do it.

229
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Why?

230
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Why?

231
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:56,000
My nose is dirty from this distance.

232
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I'm clean.

233
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
You're 41.

234
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I'm clean.

235
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Yamazaki-san, please introduce your last girlfriend.

236
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
She recently broke up with her boyfriend.

237
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Her boyfriend was three hours late for her date.

238
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
She waited for him for three hours.

239
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
She endured everything.

240
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Please call her.

241
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Chika Kihara!

242
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Please call her.

243
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Hello.

244
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Are you a cameraman?

245
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Are you a cameraman?

246
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
As a profession?

247
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
What do you do?

248
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I take pictures of magazines.

249
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Really?

250
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Yes, I take pictures of musicians.

251
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I'm looking for a company.

252
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I want to make my own work.

253
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I want to make my own work.

254
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I want to make my own work.

255
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I want to make my own work.

256
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Really?

257
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Give me the gun!

258
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Give me the gun!

259
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Give it to me!

260
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Give it to me!

261
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Give it to me!

262
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Give it to me!

263
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I'm scared.

264
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I'm scared.

265
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I'm looking at you.

266
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I'm scared.

267
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I'm scared.

268
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I don't want to die.

269
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
You're smoking, right?

270
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
That's right.

271
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I don't smoke.

272
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Don't forget to smoke.

273
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I don't smoke.

274
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I don't want to die.

275
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:22,000
You were so naive at the end.

276
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Do you have a lighter?

277
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
You look like Mr. Slim.

278
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I don't want to die.

279
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:38,000
You'll die before you realize it.

280
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I'll be brave.

281
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
It was cold.

282
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
It was very cold.

283
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
It's not perfect.

284
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Please wait for the result.

285
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Please make a judgment.

286
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Failure.

287
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I'd like to ask you again.

288
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
As I said before, I became vice president.

289
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I'm sorry, but I'd like to do it again.

290
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Ladies and gentlemen.

291
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Good evening.

292
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I'm going to send it today.

293
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I'll send it.

294
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I'll send it every week.

295
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I'll send it every week.

296
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I see.

297
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
What is it?

298
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I see.

299
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Let's get started.

300
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
What is it?

301
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
My body?

302
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I feel the same way these days.

303
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
That's terrible.

304
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I'm not breathing as well as before.

305
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
That's no good.

306
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I used to be able to do a lot of things when I was over 30.

307
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I used to be able to get on the elevator when it was open, but these days I can't.

308
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Even if I press the button three times, I can't get on the elevator.

309
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I can't get on the elevator.

310
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
But that's my taste.

311
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
No one can understand that.

312
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,000
If you say that, it will get worse and worse.

313
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
That's right.

314
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
It can't be helped.

315
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:48,000
That's right.

316
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I haven't been to the fuzoku recently.

317
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
You used to be able to get on the elevator, but you haven't been there.

318
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
That's my word.

319
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I haven't been there recently.

320
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
You haven't been to the fuzoku recently.

321
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
What do you mean by interesting fuzoku?

322
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Let me tell you.

323
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I'm getting tired of it.

324
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I'm getting tired of it because I'm surrounded by women.

325
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Then you should go to a different shop.

326
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I went to a different shop.

327
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
When I went to a different shop, the system there was like,

328
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I'm going to put something in this.

329
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
What do you want me to do?

330
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I want you to say anything.

331
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,000
At that point, my M heart was shaking.

332
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I didn't feel good when I was told to do this and that.

333
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I didn't feel good when I was told to do this and that.

334
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Who's coming?

335
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,000
That's M.

336
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Do you understand?

337
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
No, I don't understand.

338
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
You don't understand, do you?

339
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I'm a super high-class S.

340
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I'm surrounded by women.

341
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Stop it!

342
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
My face is like this.

343
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Are you an idiot?

344
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
No, I don't know.

345
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Are you an idiot?

346
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Because a comic duo is made up of S and M.

347
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
This is a fact.

348
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Otherwise, you can't do it because it's a duo.

349
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I've been doing it for 15 years.

350
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I'm a super high-class M.

351
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I'm a super high-class S.

352
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
What do you mean by super high-class?

353
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,000
What do you mean by high-class?

354
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
If it was a high-class high-class, it wouldn't be a big deal.

355
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
High-class high-class.

356
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
High-class high-class.

357
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
It means high-class high-class.

358
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
It's not a high-class high-class.

359
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I want you to be emotional.

360
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Let me tell you something good today.

361
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
A comic duo is made up of S and M.

362
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I see.

363
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I'm a super high-class M and you're a super high-class S.

364
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
It's very clear.

365
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
It's very obvious, isn't it?

366
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:57,000
If you hit me and see that I'm in pain, you won't be able to stop it.

367
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Why?

368
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Why can't you stop it?

369
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I want you to be more stupid.

370
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I want to hit you, so I want you to shake me more.

371
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
That's right.

372
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I want you to shake me more to make me more stupid.

373
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I want you to shake me more to make me more stupid.

374
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Stop it.

375
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
You might feel that way, but it's not like that.

376
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I can't say things like this.

377
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I see.

378
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I can't say things like this.

379
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I'm so tired.

380
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Stop it.

381
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
It's in your mind.

382
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
You should develop a new store.

383
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,000
You should be more aware of what you're doing.

384
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
That's right.

385
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I understand what you're saying.

386
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
As you get older, you'll gradually understand what I'm saying.

387
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
What?

388
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
In the past, I used to say things like this.

389
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I see.

390
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:59,000
But now, I say things like this because I have money.

391
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Now, I say things like this because I don't know.

392
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
You can't say things like that.

393
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I say things like this because I'm a C-class student.

394
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:15,000
You can't say things like this because you're a C-class student.

395
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Matsumoto-san, you've fought against 999 kinds of beasts and won many times.

396
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:29,000
But you were surrounded by cows and broke their bones.

397
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:35,000
If you were surrounded by them, how would you escape?

398
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,000
First of all, you shouldn't be surrounded by them.

399
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Of course, I shouldn't be surrounded by them.

400
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
But if you were surrounded by them...

401
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I understand.

402
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Come on, Anaconda.

403
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Me?

404
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Yes, because you're the only one who can fight against Anaconda.

405
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Come on.

406
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Anaconda isn't like that.

407
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Anaconda isn't like that.

408
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
That's funny.

409
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
One by one.

410
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I shouldn't say it first.

411
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Come on, Anaconda.

412
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
It's like this, right?

413
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Anaconda is more stiff.

414
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
More like this?

415
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
It's different.

416
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
But it's fine like that.

417
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Come on, Anaconda.

418
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
You can't escape.

419
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
The speed is different.

420
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:36,000
If you don't fight against Anaconda, I can't teach you.

421
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Come on, Anaconda.

422
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I'm a little stupid.

423
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I was scared to fall.

424
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
This summer, I was stung by the sun.

425
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I couldn't stop stinging.

426
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I was stung so much that I bled.

427
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:07,000
For next year, please tell me how to avoid being stung by a crab.

428
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Me?

429
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Yes.

430
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Understood.

431
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
That's fine.

432
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
What is it?

433
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Please tell me how to avoid being stung by a crab.

434
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Did you get stung a lot this year?

435
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
It seems so.

436
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I got stung so much.

437
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
And it's over this year.

438
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Of course it's over.

439
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Then, next year is impossible.

440
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
What do you mean?

441
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,000
When you get stung, you have to say,

442
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I'll end it this year.

443
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I'll let you get stung this year.

444
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I'll let you get stung this year.

445
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
I got it.

446
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I got it when I got stung.

447
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Yes.

448
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I'll let you get stung this year.

449
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Yes.

450
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I'll let you get stung this year.

451
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
But you'll get stung if you get stung.

452
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
I'll let you get stung when I get stung.

453
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I don't have to put up with it even though I got stung.

454
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I don't know if I got stung when I was talking.

455
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I got stung when I got stung.

456
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,000
If you get stung here and here, it doesn't matter.

457
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
There are times when you don't get stung.

458
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
When you don't know anything.

459
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
You don't get stung.

460
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,000
You can't understand that you got stung.

461
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
You don't get stung, do you?

462
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
I don't get stung.

463
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
If I get stung, I'll hit you and kill you.

464
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Why did you get stung?

465
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Oh, I remember.

466
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
It doesn't matter.

467
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
It doesn't matter.

468
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Do you know why I got stung?

469
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
What do you mean?

470
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Do you know why I got stung?

471
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Please tell me.

472
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
I want to suck your blood.

473
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
No, no, no, no.

474
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
That's not it.

475
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Why?

476
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
They say they're happy to make people happy.

477
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
That's why I'm going to suck your blood.

478
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I'm going to look at you for a while.

479
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Okay.

480
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Okay?

481
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Then I'm going to look at you like this.

482
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:15,000
I'm going to look at you like this.

483
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Why?

484
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Don't eat sushi.

485
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
If I get stung, they'll think I'm crazy.

486
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:32,000
If I get stung, they'll think I'm crazy.

487
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Why?

488
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Who?

489
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,000
I'm going to take your flesh.

490
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:46,000
This is the best way to get rid of stinging.

491
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Oh, I see.

492
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
I'm going to do this.

493
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:53,000
If I get stung, they'll think I'm crazy.

494
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:58,000
If I get stung, they'll think I'm crazy.

495
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:05,000
If I get stung, they'll think I'm crazy.

496
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,000
If I get stung, they'll think I'm crazy.

497
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:15,000
If I get stung, they'll think I'm crazy.

498
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Then until I get være, they're going to think I'm crazy.

499
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,000
I got you killed!

500
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
I got you killed!

501
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
With all my hair.

502
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
I got you killed!

503
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,500
Put on some hot water.

504
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,500
You shouldn't have said that!

505
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,500
It's really bad!

506
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:44,500
You don't want to see your partner like this until he dies?

507
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:49,500
You don't want to see him like you don't usually see him, right?

508
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,500
I don't want to see you doing it.

509
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,500
What is that?

510
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,500
Do you think you're doing it?

511
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,500
What are you doing?

512
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,500
You're so childish!

513
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,500
I'm winning!

514
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,500
I'm winning!

515
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:16,500
Damn it!

516
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,500
You!

517
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,500
Did you see it?

518
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,500
I'm done with that.

519
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,500
Of course.

520
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:29,500
I don't want to show you what I do all day.

521
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:32,500
I don't want to show you what I do all day.

522
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:35,500
I don't want to show you what I do all day.

523
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,500
But remember this!

524
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,500
Hey!

525
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,500
You're about to cry!

526
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:46,500
Remember this!

527
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:49,500
My sex is amazing!

528
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:52,500
My sex is amazing!

529
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:00,500
You shouldn't have said that!

530
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:22,500
This program was brought to you by these sponsors.
