1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
It's been a long time, hasn't it?

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
That's right.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
It's my first time.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
And it's Harajuku.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
It's a young man's match.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Is it okay for an old man to walk?

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Don't play with me.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I'm at work.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm going to walk around today.

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I'm going to walk around, but it's not fun to just walk around.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Today, I'm going to walk around with Mr. Warakawa.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I go to various stores.

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
There is a fitting room.

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Everyone goes in there.

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I walk around the curtains.

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I dress up and make the employees laugh.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
It's individual play.

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I understand.

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
If it's not funny, I'll kill you.

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'll kill you.

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Please be careful with that.

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
It's amazing.

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
What is this?

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I don't know.

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Is this a girl's store?

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
It's very modern.

27
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
It's amazing.

28
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Can you show me your face?

29
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
From here?

30
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Yes.

31
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Show me your face.

32
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
It's you.

33
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Show me your face.

34
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
It's you.

35
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Even ordinary customers can't do this.

36
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
This program is brought to you by these sponsors.

37
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I don't know.

38
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Don't you wear a hat like this?

39
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Stop it.

40
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Stop it?

41
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
It's okay.

42
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
You might look good in a hat like this.

43
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
It's like this.

44
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
It's like this.

45
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I don't think so.

46
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Please look inside.

47
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Please put this on.

48
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
That's good.

49
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
This is good, too.

50
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
It looks good on you.

51
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Wait a minute.

52
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
It's cute.

53
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
You don't look good at all.

54
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
It's hard to talk to you.

55
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Don't say that.

56
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
This is the room.

57
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
This is a man's room.

58
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Hello.

59
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Thank you for coming.

60
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Please buy something.

61
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Please buy something.

62
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Please buy something.

63
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
That's right.

64
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
END

65
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Please buy something.

66
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I like this.

67
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Please buy something.

68
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
That's right.

69
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Hama-san.

70
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Please come.

71
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
This way?

72
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
It looks short.

73
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I'm sorry.

74
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Ice coffee, please.

75
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Is that so?

76
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Do you have ice coffee?

77
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Yes.

78
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I'm sorry.

79
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Is it okay?

80
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
The clerk is calling you.

81
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I have to ask the clerk to take a look.

82
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I have to ask the clerk to take a look.

83
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Can you go?

84
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Yes.

85
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Why are you calling me?

86
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Please look at the clerk.

87
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Please look at the clerk.

88
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I don't like it.

89
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Why did you open it before?

90
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I thought you wouldn't say that.

91
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
But you opened it before.

92
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
That's right.

93
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
It's a little different.

94
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
It's a little different.

95
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
It's completely different from the image.

96
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I thought you were going to wear it.

97
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
That's right.

98
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
That's why the first look is important.

99
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
That's right.

100
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
It's not the kind of clothes that END wears.

101
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Thank you very much.

102
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Thank you very much.

103
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Thank you very much.

104
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
It's cool.

105
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
It's not what Yuta said earlier.

106
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I don't know how important the first look is.

107
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
That's right.

108
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
That's what I want to say.

109
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
That's what I want to say.

110
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
It's different from the image.

111
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
That's right.

112
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I want to say one more thing.

113
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
You shouldn't slip.

114
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
That's right.

115
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
What do you think of these two?

116
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Do you want to try it on?

117
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
It's a little adult.

118
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
It's cool.

119
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Let's try it on.

120
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
It's nice.

121
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
It's neatly organized.

122
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
That's right.

123
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Let's ask someone to try it on.

124
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Yamaguchi-san.

125
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I think you should try on a jersey.

126
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
You don't have a jersey, do you?

127
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I don't know if it's a jersey.

128
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Let's try on a normal jersey.

129
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Let's try on a normal jersey.

130
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Let's try on a normal jersey.

131
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Is this Lonsdale?

132
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Yes.

133
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Thank you.

134
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Excuse me.

135
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Hurry up.

136
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
What is this?

137
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
It's Lonsdale.

138
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
It's easy to cut.

139
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Really?

140
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
What do you think?

141
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Let's try it on.

142
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
What are you doing?

143
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
You shouldn't do that.

144
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Stop it.

145
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
What are you trying to wear?

146
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Come out.

147
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
It's a jersey.

148
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
It's easy to cut.

149
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Really?

150
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
It's a good size.

151
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
It's a good size.

152
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I think you can do it.

153
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I think you can do it.

154
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
You're talking nonsense.

155
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I think you're a man who's been living your life.

156
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I think you're a man who's been living your life.

157
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I think so.

158
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I think you're older than us.

159
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I think you're older than us.

160
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Old man?

161
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I don't know.

162
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I don't know.

163
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
It's not a big deal.

164
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
It's not a big deal.

165
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
The weather is nice.

166
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
It's not like this anymore.

167
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
If there's a crepe, I'll eat it.

168
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Let's eat.

169
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Let's eat.

170
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I'll do my best.

171
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
There's ice cream.

172
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
You said crepe.

173
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
There's crepe in Harajuku.

174
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Do you want to buy one?

175
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Why do you buy one?

176
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Let's buy one.

177
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Let's buy one.

178
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Let's buy one.

179
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I'll buy vanilla mocha.

180
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I can't use it.

181
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I can't use it.

182
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
This is a vanilla mocha.

183
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
105 yen.

184
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
This is for you.

185
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Thank you.

186
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I want to lose to 100 yen.

187
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I'll give it to you.

188
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Thank you.

189
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Thank you.

190
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I'll give it to you.

191
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
It looks delicious.

192
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
It's delicious.

193
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Thank you.

194
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Thank you.

195
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I'll give it to you.

196
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I'll give it to you.

197
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Don't fight.

198
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Don't fight.

199
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
There are many.

200
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
There are many.

201
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
It's a brown one.

202
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
It's an open cafe.

203
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Don't fight.

204
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I'm embarrassed.

205
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I'm embarrassed.

206
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I'll give you another one.

207
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I'll give you another one.

208
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
You are a foodie.

209
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
You are a foodie.

210
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I'll give you another one.

211
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I'm glad.

212
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I'm glad.

213
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
You should eat it yourself.

214
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
He is angry.

215
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I'm angry.

216
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
He is angry.

217
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
He's laughing

218
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
To be honest, I don't know how to react

219
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
It's good

220
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I'll drink it here

221
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
It's good

222
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
It's embarrassing

223
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
This is for kids

224
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I'll use it

225
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
It's okay

226
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Yamasaki, drink beer

227
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I can't do it

228
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
You can't do it

229
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Drink beer

230
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Drink Tanaka Wokka

231
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Tanaka Wokka

232
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Are you going to make him drunk?

233
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Are you okay?

234
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I'm going to do it now

235
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I'm going to do it now

236
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I'm going to do it now

237
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Why are you looking at this old man?

238
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
It's amazing

239
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Let's toast

240
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Cheers

241
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Thank you

242
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I haven't finished my work yet

243
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Yamaguchi, you are good

244
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
What are you doing?

245
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
It's a one-on-one

246
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
It's Wokka's double

247
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
When I was young, I played one-on-one with Matsumoto

248
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
We played one-on-one

249
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
At that time, it was crazy

250
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
It was crazy

251
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
It was one-on-one

252
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Wokka Wokka

253
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
You don't drink alcohol, do you?

254
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I can drink

255
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
You can drink

256
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
You can drink

257
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
When you're in trouble

258
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
You can drink

259
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I'm going

260
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Are you okay?

261
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Who's next?

262
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
After all

263
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
What do you call it?

264
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Giga Arai

265
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
End

266
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Everyone is like that

267
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Next time

268
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
My master

269
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Really?

270
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
This is

271
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
This is the origin of the laughter of the general public

272
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I think my master will say that

273
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Really?

274
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
To be honest

275
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I'm counting on you

276
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I have a sense of crisis

277
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Don't have a sense of crisis

278
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
How many years?

279
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
How many years?

280
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
12 years

281
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
It's impossible

282
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
18 years

283
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
18 years?

284
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Is this the 20th anniversary in two years?

285
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
That's right

286
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Can you change the image of that Ibushi Gin?

287
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Can you change the image of that Ibushi Gin?

288
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I want to see that

289
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Please

290
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Let's go with this feeling

291
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Let's go

292
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
18 years

293
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
It's the end

294
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Of course

295
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Of course

296
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Shut up

297
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Let's see

298
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Shut up

299
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
18 years

300
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
You can see it

301
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Let's go

302
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Let's hurry

303
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
You can see it

304
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
If you look at us

305
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I and Matsumoto

306
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
This is not good

307
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
That's right

308
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
You have decided what to do before you enter

309
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
You have decided what to do before you enter

310
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
You can decide after you enter

311
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Really?

312
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I realized it from the 17th year

313
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Last year

314
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I realized it last year

315
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I didn't realize it

316
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I didn't realize it at all

317
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
It's not over yet

318
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
It's not like this

319
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
No

320
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
It's not like that

321
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
It's good for summer

322
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
It's not good

323
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
It's not good

324
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
It's not good

325
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
You are talking a lot

326
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
You are talking a lot

327
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
He is my master

328
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
He is my master

329
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I can do anything

330
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I can do anything

331
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
But I don't choose the best

332
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Sometimes I go home

333
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
That's the worst

334
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I'm fine today

335
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I'm fine today

336
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I'm fine today

337
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
This

338
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
This

339
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
This is a big space

340
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
This is a big space

341
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Hello

342
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
You can see it from the wind

343
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I don't wear suits

344
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I don't wear suits

345
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I'll change my jacket

346
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I'll change my jacket

347
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Can I change my suit?

348
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I

349
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I'm a professional

350
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I'm a professional

351
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I'm a professional

352
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I have to listen to the staff

353
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I have to listen to the staff

354
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Why are you wearing it?

355
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I'm going to buy it

356
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I'm sorry

357
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I'll have my jacket later

358
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I have to listen to the staff

359
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
He has money

360
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
He has money

361
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I can't buy my jacket

362
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I can't buy my jacket

363
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I can't buy my jacket

364
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Alright

365
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Is this all summer?

366
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
This is all summer

367
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Isn't it hot around this time?

368
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Isn't it hot around this time?

369
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Oh, I have a jacket

370
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Isn't it hot around this time?

371
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Isn't it hot in here?

372
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
It might be a little hot.

373
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
It's almost the same as I thought.

374
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
White is the key.

375
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
This is the end of 2018.

376
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Wait a minute.

377
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Are you a prosecutor?

378
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Are you hungry?

379
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
You look like you're going to die.

380
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I did it.

381
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
You did it.

382
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
There's a lot of white.

383
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
That's right.

384
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
But I don't know if it's scary.

385
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Did you see something?

386
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I saw it today.

387
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
That's right.

388
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Is that what happens when you wear it?

389
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
That's right.

390
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I think I went to a town like that.

391
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I don't think I look good in a suit.

392
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Maybe it's better not to wear it.

393
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Thank you very much.

394
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Thank you very much.

395
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
What is it?

396
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I don't know.

397
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
As you can see.

398
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Wonderful.

399
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
As expected.

400
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
As expected.

401
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
As expected.

402
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
It's our 18th year.

403
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
That's right.

404
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
It's different from the first year.

405
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
That's right.

406
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
It's the weight of history.

407
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Who's going to do it next?

408
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Who's going to do it next?

409
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I'll do it.

410
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
We chose the store.

411
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
That's right.

412
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I'll leave it to you.

413
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
It's open here.

414
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
That's right.

415
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Look at this.

416
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:32,000
There's a lot of laughter.

417
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Is it here?

418
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
The laughter of people walking is falling.

419
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
That's right.

420
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
But the top and bottom are the same store.

421
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
That's right.

422
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,000
The laughter rises from the bottom to the top.

423
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
That's right.

424
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Let's go.

425
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Let's go.

426
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
It's here.

427
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
It's here.

428
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I'll show you the 7th year.

429
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
That's right.

430
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I'll do my best.

431
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,000
There are a lot of T-shirts that you like.

432
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
That's right.

433
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
You're so fast.

434
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
You're not tanned.

435
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
That's right.

436
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Are you okay?

437
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I don't know if it's expensive.

438
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Excuse me.

439
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Can I come in?

440
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Excuse me.

441
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Can I come in anywhere?

442
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
That's right.

443
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
There are a lot of cars here.

444
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
There are a lot of cars here.

445
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
There are a lot of cars here.

446
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Are you going to dress up?

447
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I'm going to go to the theater.

448
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Theater?

449
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
You don't understand the word for theater, do you?

450
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I don't know the word for theater.

451
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I don't know the word for theater.

452
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I don't know the word for theater.

453
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I'm talking to an actor.

454
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I don't know the word for theater.

455
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I came here.

456
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I'll show you the store.

457
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Are you happy?

458
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I'm happy.

459
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Did you find anything?

460
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Did you find anything?

461
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
No.

462
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I found it.

463
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Did you find anything?

464
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I found it.

465
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I found it.

466
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
What is this?

467
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Did you find anything?

468
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
No.

469
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Did you find anything?

470
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
The end.

471
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Please close the store.

472
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I'm sorry.

473
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I'm still young.

474
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
The silhouette has disappeared.

475
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I'm sorry.

476
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I'm sorry.

477
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Good luck.

478
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
It was still early.

479
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
It was still early.

480
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
It was early.

481
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Let's go.

482
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
I'm sorry.

483
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
It's difficult.

484
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
As you can see,

485
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
It's been seven years.

486
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
It's been seven years.

487
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
It's been seven years.

488
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
As you said,

489
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
It's been 18 years.

490
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
It's been 18 years.

491
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
It's been 18 years.

492
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Please show me.

493
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Please show me.

494
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Please show me.

495
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I'm addicted to comedy.

496
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Please call me OACHU.

497
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Please call me OACHU.

498
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I'm always laughing.

499
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
I'm always laughing.

500
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I want to laugh.

501
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I'm ready.

502
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I'm ready.

503
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I'm ready.

504
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
It's red.

505
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Look.

506
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
It's normal.

507
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
It's normal.

508
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
It's normal.

509
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
It's normal.

510
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
It's OACHU.

511
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
What if you get out of the store?

512
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
What if you get out of the store?

513
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
What?

514
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Is this the store?

515
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Look at the name of the store.

516
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Hachika 2N 1

517
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Hachika?

518
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
This is the name of the store.

519
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I do not know.

520
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Come here.

521
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
It's the 18th year.

522
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Hello.

523
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Please show me.

524
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
It's a store name.

525
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,300
It's a no-sleeve.

526
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:38,300
White pants and no-sleeve is good, isn't it?

527
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:40,300
Yes, no-sleeve is the trend now.

528
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:42,300
It's quite an image.

529
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:46,300
I'd like to change my mind.

530
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:51,300
I'd like to go to a place where my interests have changed.

531
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:54,300
I'd like to try this on.

532
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:56,300
I'd like to try this on.

533
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:57,300
Try it on.

534
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:58,300
May I?

535
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,300
It's quite an image.

536
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:04,300
It's quite an image.

537
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:06,300
Is it okay to wear this?

538
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:08,300
What if I'm wearing it?

539
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,300
That's too much.

540
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:11,300
May I?

541
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:12,300
Yes.

542
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:13,300
Excuse me.

543
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:19,300
Today is the 18th anniversary.

544
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:20,300
Today is the 18th anniversary.

545
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:21,300
It's a miracle.

546
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:22,300
It's a miracle.

547
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:23,300
It's a miracle.

548
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:24,300
It's a miracle.

549
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:27,300
I think I'll be able to see a little bit of his comedy.

550
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:29,300
I think I'll be able to see a little bit of his comedy.

551
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:32,300
I'm going to drop everything I'm holding on to.

552
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:34,300
I think I'll be able to see a little bit of his comedy.

553
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:37,300
I have to hold it all down with a smile.

554
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:50,300
How old are you in the audience?

555
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:54,300
I'm in my 20s.

556
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:56,300
You're pretty young.

557
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:58,300
The old man is coming in.

558
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:00,300
He's the guide.

559
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:02,300
Can I come in?

560
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:04,300
Please stand up.

561
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:05,300
I'm ready.

562
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:07,300
Can I come in?

563
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:09,300
Please stand up.

564
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:34,300
I'm ready.

565
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:36,300
Can I come in?

566
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:38,300
Please stand up.

567
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:39,300
Can I come in?

568
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:41,300
What's wrong with you guys?

569
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:44,300
It was a powerful technique.

570
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:45,300
To be honest.

571
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:48,300
I thought it was a terrible technique.

572
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,300
Today is the 18th year.

573
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:52,300
Is that a sword?

574
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:54,300
That's not a sword.

575
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:57,300
I don't think it's a sword.

576
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:59,300
Take a little more bamboo.

577
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:02,300
Do you really want to come in?

578
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:04,300
Do you really want to come in?

579
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:06,300
I really want to come in.

580
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:09,300
I'm sorry.

581
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:11,300
I'm sorry.

582
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:12,300
What?

583
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:15,300
What?

584
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:18,300
Your pants are frozen.

585
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:22,300
To be honest, it was a powerful technique.

586
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:24,300
It doesn't matter.

587
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:25,300
It doesn't matter?

588
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:26,300
It doesn't matter.

589
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:28,300
It doesn't matter.

590
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:29,300
It doesn't matter.

591
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:31,300
Please give me a receipt.

592
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:33,300
Please give me a receipt.

593
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:34,300
I give you a receipt.

594
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:36,300
Please give me a receipt.

595
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:37,300
I found it.

596
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:38,300
Please give me a receipt.

597
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:40,300
Please give me a receipt.

598
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:43,300
Please give me a receipt.

599
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:45,300
I'm shopping.

600
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,300
Don't get in my way.

601
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,300
It's private.

602
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:51,300
It's not private.

603
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:52,300
It doesn't matter.

604
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:54,300
And it doesn't look good on you.

605
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:56,300
It doesn't look good on you.

606
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:58,300
And it doesn't look good on you.

607
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:00,300
This is a store for junior high school students.

608
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:03,300
35-year-olds don't look good in it.

609
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:05,300
Don't get in my way.

610
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:07,300
Get out of here.

611
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:10,300
I don't feel good in it.

612
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:12,300
It doesn't look good on you.

613
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:13,300
It's private.

614
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:15,300
It doesn't look good on you.

615
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:32,300
