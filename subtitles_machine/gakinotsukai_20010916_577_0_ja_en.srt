00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:28,000
This program is brought to you by the following sponsors.

2
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I've heard that you've eaten the soil of an imaginary creature.

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Yes, yes, yes.

4
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Mr. Matsumoto.

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Yes.

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Please tell me what kind of creature it is and what kind of taste it has.

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Well, I've eaten it.

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I've become full.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I've become full just from eating soil.

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
No, no, no.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
First of all, where did you find that soil?

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Eh?

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Where did you find it?

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
You're saying strange things.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
For example, have you ever eaten Beijing duck?

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
No, I haven't.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Where did you find that duck?

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I went to the store and ate it.

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
That's right. I also went to the store and ate it.

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
The store?

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Why didn't you find your own food?

22
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
It's strange. It's strange.

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
You didn't put the soil in the store, did you?

24
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
There is a store that has it.

25
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Actually, there is.

26
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
It's in the back of the store.

27
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I don't know where it is.

28
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I don't know where it is.

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Where is it?

30
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Where is it?

31
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
In which prefecture?

32
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Ah, it's in Tokyo.

33
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
What kind of restaurant is it?

34
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Well, I'll tell you.

35
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Please cut this part.

36
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
No, it's fine.

37
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
In Ebisu,

38
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
there is a shop that sells Nepali food.

39
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Is that so?

40
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
It's in the back of the store.

41
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
No, it's not there.

42
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Why is the soil in the store Nepali?

43
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Well, it's Nepali food.

44
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
There is Japanese food in the back of the store.

45
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I see.

46
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
It's in the back of the store.

47
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
It's called Hanafusa.

48
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
It sounds like a steakhouse.

49
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
It's there.

50
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
It's Japanese food.

51
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
It's not on the menu.

52
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
It's in the back of the store.

53
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I see.

54
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
The boss asks you to serve it.

55
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
If I ask him to serve it, he will.

56
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
It's very valuable.

57
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I don't know if he will serve it in the store.

58
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I see.

59
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
How do you cook it?

60
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
There are many ways.

61
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
What kind of food do you eat?

62
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
The most authentic way is to use an octopus string.

63
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
It's grilled pork.

64
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
What kind of food do you eat?

65
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I cut it into slices.

66
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I slice it and put curry on it.

67
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
You put curry on it?

68
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
It has a strong smell.

69
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I see.

70
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
That's the most authentic way.

71
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
That's the most authentic way.

72
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
How much does it cost?

73
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Well, to be honest...

74
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
The price is...

75
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I only eat it after my payday.

76
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
That's a lot.

77
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
It's expensive.

78
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
It's expensive.

79
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
It's a little expensive if it's not a card.

80
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
It's not a card.

81
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Other than that, it's not grilled pork.

82
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
It's Japanese cuisine.

83
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
If you go to a Japanese restaurant and eat grilled pork...

84
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
That's the most authentic way to eat it.

85
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
If it's Japanese cuisine, do you dip it in vinegar?

86
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
That's the most authentic way.

87
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
That's the most authentic way.

88
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
The most authentic way is...

89
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
It comes out like that.

90
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
It looks like that.

91
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I cut it and there's a lot of rice in it.

92
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
It's squid rice.

93
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
It's squid rice.

94
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
There's a lot of rice in it.

95
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
It's squid rice.

96
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
It's not squid at all.

97
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
It's all cooked in the same way.

98
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Grilled pork...

99
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Squid rice...

100
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I was told that.

101
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
That's what Gen-san said.

102
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I didn't know that.

103
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Gen-san said that.

104
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I didn't know that.

105
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I cut it and there's a lot of rice in it.

106
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
There's a lot of rice in it.

107
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
There's a lot of rice in it.

108
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
What about the taste?

109
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
What about the taste?

110
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
The taste is...

111
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
You said it smelled.

112
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
It smells.

113
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
If I had to say the taste...

114
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,000
It's the taste of my mother.

115
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I've never seen it before.

116
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I've never eaten it before.

117
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
It's the taste of my mother.

118
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
It's close.

119
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I put my head here.

120
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I put my head here with sake and sake.

121
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
It's salt.

122
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
It's salt.

123
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
What do you do with your head?

124
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I put it on the edge of the glass.

125
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Isn't that a decoration?

126
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
It's a decoration.

127
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
It's like a lemon.

128
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
It's like a lemon.

129
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Please tell me the name of the restaurant.

130
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
If we can line up, it'll be...

131
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I don't know with the current information.

132
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
It's the Japanese food that was in the Nepal restaurant.

133
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I don't know.

134
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
It's in a place where we can get it.

135
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
You can get caught.

136
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
It's in a place where we can get it.

137
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
You're a fool.

138
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
You're good at competition.

139
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Seriously.

140
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
You'll be surprised.

141
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
It's a big deal.

142
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
It's not a story.

143
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Another one will come out.

144
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Seriously.

145
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Where there was nothing.

146
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I want to be Bim-Bim, but another one will come out.

147
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
That's...

148
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:06,000
That's what women do.

149
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I have a question for Matsumoto-san.

150
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:16,000
What's on the back of the moon that you can't see from Earth?

151
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
To put it simply, I was surprised too.

152
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:19,000
To put it simply, I was surprised too.

153
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,000
To put it simply, I was surprised too.

154
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
What's on the back of the moon?

155
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:43,980
There's a

156
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:44,980
Why don't you understand?

157
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:47,000
Why don't you understand?

158
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Please explain it in an easy way.

159
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I'm sorry.

160
00:06:50,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I'm sorry.

161
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
What should I do?

162
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I was surprised too.

163
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Look at this.

164
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
What is it?

165
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I was surprised that I made a space shuttle and went to the moon.

166
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
You don't need to do that.

167
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
You can focus on the back of the moon.

168
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
The back of the moon is saying strange things.

169
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
It's not strange.

170
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Then let's make this.

171
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I made it with homework.

172
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I was tired of going there.

173
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,000
It's impossible.

174
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Why do you think it's impossible?

175
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
It's here.

176
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
It's here.

177
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I made it.

178
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Really?

179
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
It took me two weeks.

180
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
That's fast.

181
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I was supposed to make it in six days.

182
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
It took me 14 days.

183
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
That's a lot of work.

184
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
That's a lot of work.

185
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
What did you do with the material?

186
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Material.

187
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:12,000
The man next to me was in NASA.

188
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
What were you doing in NASA?

189
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:20,000
He was the man of the cafeteria.

190
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
NASA?

191
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
He was the man of the cafeteria.

192
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
The man who lived next to me.

193
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
He called me Mr. Toba.

194
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
That's all you can do?

195
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
No, he called me Mr. Toba.

196
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Really?

197
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Yes.

198
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:43,000
He lived in NASA, but he called me Mr. Toba.

199
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
That's all you can do.

200
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Mr. Toba told me not to say such stupid things.

201
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Mr. Toba.

202
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Material.

203
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
You're stupid.

204
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
What?

205
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
You don't know anything.

206
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
You're really useless.

207
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
What?

208
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Do you know?

209
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
What?

210
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Taxi drivers and club mommies.

211
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
They know the most about politics.

212
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
They listen to you.

213
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
They listen to you the most.

214
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,000
In that sense, Mr. Toba in the cafeteria worked for NASA.

215
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:29,000
He listened to everything you said about the diode not shining.

216
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
That's too detailed.

217
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
It doesn't matter if it's a light-emitting diode.

218
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Material.

219
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
He listened to everything.

220
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
He listened to everything.

221
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
He listened to everything.

222
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
What are you doing next to him?

223
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Soba?

224
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Where are you listening from?

225
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
He listened to everything.

226
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:05,000
He pretended to boil the noodles, but he didn't boil them.

227
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
There was a lot of surprising information.

228
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
When you're eating, you become a human.

229
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
You become defenseless.

230
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Eating and life and eating.

231
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I see.

232
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
At this time, he says things he shouldn't say.

233
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
He says he'll forgive his heart.

234
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
It's a sense of freedom.

235
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
He listened to a lot of things there.

236
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I listened to Mr. Toba.

237
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I see.

238
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
That's how Space Shuttle works.

239
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I got it.

240
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Everyone can do it.

241
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Space Shuttle is easy to do.

242
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Surprisingly.

243
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
The name Space Shuttle has its drawbacks.

244
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
That's right.

245
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I think it's difficult.

246
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
What should I do?

247
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Please tell me.

248
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
If it's easy.

249
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
What?

250
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Please clean your nose.

251
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
What should I do to make it the easiest?

252
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
First of all, the mayonnaise plate.

253
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
The star-shaped one.

254
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I like mayonnaise.

255
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I don't know if it's a crow or you.

256
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I like mayonnaise.

257
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
The star-shaped one should be clean.

258
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
All inside?

259
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Yes, all inside.

260
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Please clean it.

261
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Then inflate it all.

262
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Please cap it.

263
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
This is almost the main engine.

264
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I can't speak.

265
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I think this is almost the main engine.

266
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
But this is the main engine.

267
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
What's wrong with that?

268
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
It's smaller than me.

269
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
That's right.

270
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I can't go to the moon like this.

271
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
You're a fool.

272
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Why?

273
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
If you think so, you're not qualified to go to the moon.

274
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Really?

275
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I'll tell you the most important thing to do in the moon.

276
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
You want to go to the moon.

277
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
You want to go.

278
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I know that.

279
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
If you don't have that, no matter how many facilities you have, it's impossible.

280
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
This is impossible.

281
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
No way.

282
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Right?

283
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
That's right.

284
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
You want to go to Yoshimoto, so you want to go, right?

285
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
It's different from that.

286
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
What do you mean?

287
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Yoshimoto Space Shuttle is very similar.

288
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
It's not similar.

289
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
It's almost the same.

290
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
It's almost the same.

291
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I think you can't go to the moon like this.

292
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:48,000
If I'm in a bad mood, I'll go to the moon.

293
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I'm sorry.

294
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
You're a fool.

295
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I'm sorry.

296
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I think you can't go to the moon like this.

297
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Even if you want to go to the moon, you think this is the main engine.

298
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
And you're like this.

299
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:09,000
The main engine of the Shinkansen is like this.

300
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
That's not true.

301
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
You're a fool.

302
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
You don't know anything.

303
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
That's not true.

304
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:23,000
The main engine of the Shinkansen is like this.

305
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
It's like this.

306
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
That's the basics.

307
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
That's the basics.

308
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
That's what I'm saying.

309
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
The main engine of the Space Shuttle is like this.

310
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
That's a mistake.

311
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
What kind of accessories do you put on it?

312
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
You have to fly.

313
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
That's right.

314
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
That's right.

315
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
What kind of accessories are you talking about?

316
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
There are a lot of accessories.

317
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Tell me about it.

318
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
First of all, the refrigerator.

319
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
No, no, no.

320
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
It's a vegetable room in the refrigerator.

321
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
It's transparent.

322
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:08,000
And a cup of water.

323
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
A cup of water.

324
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,000
And a cup of vinegar.

325
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
And?

326
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
And?

327
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:24,000
And then, the mayonnaise that you made at the base.

328
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Put it in there.

329
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
It's a good space if it's not a vegetable room.

330
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
It's a good space if it's not a vegetable room.

331
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
It's a good space if it's not a vegetable room.

332
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
It's a good space.

333
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Put it in there.

334
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:48,000
And then, the hair dryer.

335
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Well, that's how it works.

336
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:02,000
His laughter is all about telling stories.

337
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
That's not how it works.

338
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:08,000
It's like he's laughing more.

339
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
You know, you know.

340
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
A hair dryer is weird.

341
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
You can't go there.

342
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
It's weird.

343
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
What's weird?

344
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
In the end, the invention is a hair dryer.

345
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Well, well, well.

346
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
The last one.

347
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
You're doing the beansprout.

348
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Can you tell me why it's on there?

349
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I'll tell you Edison made it.

350
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
If you tell me, I'll...

351
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
It's weird, isn't it? It's on and off all the time.

352
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
It's on and off all the time.

353
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I see.

354
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
It's like a hair dryer.

355
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
You can only say it's a hair dryer.

356
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
A hair dryer.

357
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Then, please explain the microwave.

358
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
What?

359
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
It's a microwave.

360
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
It's being removed from the inside.

361
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
What's going on?

362
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Well, that's true.

363
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
In the end, it's a hair dryer.

364
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Electrical products, you know?

365
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
If you go to a factory, they don't have much.

366
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
That's not true.

367
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:13,000
It's a huge hair dryer.

368
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
It's a huge hair dryer.

369
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
It doesn't matter if it's big or small.

370
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
If there's no part, you can't make things.

371
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:26,000
If there's no part, you can't make things.

372
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,000
If there's no part, you can't make things.

373
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
No, no, no.

374
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
You're really stupid.

375
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Why?

376
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Go home and break the microwave.

377
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Tear off the back.

378
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Basically, there's nothing in it.

379
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:50,000
If I had to say, it's an amulet.

380
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:55,000
If you do this, it's going to be a mess.

381
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I hope you get a head.

382
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
But...

383
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:07,000
But I'm sending it out.

384
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Aoka.

385
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Go away!

386
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I don't know.

387
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I don't know about that.

388
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I'm sorry. I didn't know that.

389
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
You're hopeless.

390
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I'm doing it at home.

391
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
If I suddenly get sick, I can't do it here.

392
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
No, no, no.

393
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
You can't do anything like that.

394
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Call Miko.

395
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,000
And ask Miko to do it for you.

396
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
But he's doing it for Toshiba.

397
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
He's doing it for Toshiba.

398
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
So who's going to win?

399
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
What are you doing?

400
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I'm going to repair it. I'm going to take it to Toshiba.

401
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Even at the repair factory, he's doing it.

402
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I can't help it if it doesn't get fixed.

403
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
But I can't help it if it doesn't get fixed.

404
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
I can't help it.

405
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I'm going to pray for it.

406
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:10,000
There are people in India who have been doing this for decades.

407
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I heard about it recently.

408
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I heard that you've been doing this for five years.

409
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
How did you spend five years?

410
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
How should I put it?

411
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
It's either S or M.

412
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I don't know.

413
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
It's either S or M.

414
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
It's either S or M.

415
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
It's either S or M.

416
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I'm surprised.

417
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:43,000
When I see people in pain or suffering, I laugh like this.

418
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I'm sure it's going to take a while.

419
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I'm sure it's going to take a while.

420
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I did it with Yamazaki and Moriman.

421
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I did it with Yamazaki and Moriman.

422
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I'm the one who's the most upset that Yamazaki is being beaten up.

423
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I'm the one who's the most upset that Yamazaki is being beaten up.

424
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:13,000
So you've been doing this for five years, you made it right?

425
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Where did the M story come from?

426
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:21,000
There are times when you этого, people rememberja Kill the mind.

427
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,000
So they try harder when they think.

428
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
So they try harder when they think.

429
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:33,000
It's like you're trying to get over it, even though it's about to turn red.

430
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
That kind of excitement.

431
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
A sense of outlaw.

432
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
That kind of thing exists.

433
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
It's not painful, is it?

434
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
It is painful.

435
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
It's painful, but...

436
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
It's painful, but I like it.

437
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
It makes you feel good?

438
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Yes.

439
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:54,000
In that sense, I can understand that I've been living with one hand up for five years.

440
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
But I don't want to do the same thing as others.

441
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
That's right.

442
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I've done a lot of training.

443
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
What have you done?

444
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
What do you mean?

445
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
For five years...

446
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
For five years, what have you done?

447
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Ah, for five years...

448
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
For five years, I've been surprised.

449
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I've been doing this for five years.

450
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
I couldn't do anything about it.

451
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Even if the police stopped me and gave me a license...

452
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
No, you could have done that.

453
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
You could have done what you're doing right now.

454
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
No, but if they took me away, even if they said something like,

455
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
You're suspicious!

456
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
No, you could have done that.

457
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Even if they said, You're that murderer from back then!

458
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,000
For these five years, it was really painful.

459
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
That's...

460
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
It's hard to live like that.

461
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
It was painful.

462
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
To be surprised for five years.

463
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
It was painful.

464
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
There's nothing to be surprised about.

465
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
There isn't, right?

466
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
There wasn't.

467
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
During sex, I was surprised.

468
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,000
That's because there's no one who's more open-minded than you.

469
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
That's right.

470
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
You're looking from below and dancing like this.

471
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
What?

472
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Am I different from other people?

473
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
My panties are all wet.

474
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
No, no, don't point your finger at me.

475
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
If you point your finger at me, the meaning changes.

476
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,000
When you announce things like winning,

477
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
You always use drumroll.

478
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Ah, that's right.

479
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Drumroll.

480
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Winning.

481
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
To be honest, I'm sick of it.

482
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
It's not like I'm sick of it or anything.

483
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Mr. Matsumoto, when you announce something other than drumroll,

484
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,000
What do you think of when you announce it?

485
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Well, if you say you're sick of it,

486
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
You have to think about it.

487
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
But everyone's used to hearing it.

488
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,000
They say, drumroll, so it's exciting.

489
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Well, that's true, but

490
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Is it okay because you're used to it?

491
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
That's what I mean.

492
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Then the adventure spirit disappears.

493
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
I want to find something new.

494
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Well, well, well.

495
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Right? Let's do that.

496
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
But there are a lot of people who fail.

497
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Don't say it's new.

498
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
There are a lot.

499
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
There are people who say it was better before.

500
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
That's fine. Then let's think about drumroll.

501
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Let's think about something new.

502
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Let's think about something that's not drumroll.

503
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Like what?

504
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Let's think about it for 10 minutes.

505
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
I'm sure they'll laugh at me.

506
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
The winner is...

507
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Until now, it's been...

508
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
What about the piano?

509
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
What's a piano?

510
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
The sound is a little different.

511
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Hatsugaya?

512
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
That's...

513
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
It's like editing.

514
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
The winner is...

515
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
What is it?

516
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Number 16!

517
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Well, Mr. Matsumoto, that's fine.

518
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
That's fine.

519
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Then I'll do it.

520
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
The winner is...

521
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
I told you to think about it for 10 minutes.

522
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
It's not solid at all.

523
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
It's not solid at all.

524
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
It's a mistake.

525
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Don't force yourself to do it.

526
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
I was wondering if I could do it.

527
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
I was overconfident.

528
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
I'm attacking you right now.

529
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
You know...

530
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Why can't I play drumroll?

531
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
I see.

532
00:23:51,000 --> 00:24:06,000
I want to say it.
