00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
THE END

2
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Good evening

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Today has finally come

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
We have invited a lot of people

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Today, we have invited a lot of people

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
We have invited them to come to America

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
It was a shocking event

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
For the entertainment world

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Isn't it a bomb statement?

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
His statement that he is going to America

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Even so

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
There is no program to find a spot for this person

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
He said that he looks like Geno

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
If we don't leave him like that

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Isn't it pitiful?

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Even so, he is our senpai

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
That's right

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
If we broadcast this

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I think a lot of people will buy it

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Why are you looking for a spot?

21
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Let's have Shirakuri appear

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Please

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
It's a gorilla

24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Isn't it a gorilla?

25
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
What is this?

26
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Today is a day to go on a trip

27
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I told you to look at the nose

28
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
As I said before

29
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
There is no program to say goodbye to Jimmy-chan?

30
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
There is no program at all

31
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Really?

32
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Don't laugh

33
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Our program didn't have a lot of guests

34
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
There were 310 times

35
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
The number of times that Jimmy appeared was 15 times

36
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
This is the most

37
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
It can't be helped if we don't find a spot

38
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
It's a great contribution

39
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:20,000
This is a summary of Jimmy's activities

40
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Please look at it

41
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Thank you

42
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
He doesn't say anything funny

43
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
He doesn't say anything funny

44
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
He doesn't say anything funny

45
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I was surprised

46
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
He doesn't say anything funny

47
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
You know that

48
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
He doesn't say anything funny

49
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
He doesn't say anything funny

50
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
He doesn't say anything funny

51
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
This program is brought to you by these sponsors

52
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Jimmy Onishi

53
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
His real name is Onishi Hideaki

54
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
He is a unique Japanese comedian

55
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
His love for comedy continues to give us peace and dreams

56
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
He is now saying goodbye to us

57
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
He is going to travel to America

58
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
This is a great miracle of a comedian

59
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
He is good

60
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
In 1992, Jimmy Onishi appeared for the first time

61
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:37,000
This is the first time that he is going to travel to America

62
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Your face is chubby

63
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Hello

64
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
This is Jimmy Onishi

65
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Hello

66
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
What?

67
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
He is a comedian

68
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I don't know him

69
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
He is a comedian

70
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Look at him

71
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
He is doing it

72
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
He is famous

73
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
My younger brother is a comedian

74
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I want to show him

75
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Come and play with us

76
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
What should I do?

77
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Come and play with us

78
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Don't run away

79
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Don't run away

80
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
He ran away

81
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
A lot of things happened and he finally came

82
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I didn't think he would run away

83
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
This is Jimmy Onishi

84
00:04:47,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Thank you

85
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Hello

86
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Hello

87
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
This is Jimmy Onishi

88
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
You know him

89
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Excuse me

90
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Can you touch here?

91
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
He is wet

92
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Why is he wet?

93
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Really?

94
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I don't know

95
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
He is really chubby

96
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I don't know

97
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Really?

98
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I don't know why he is wet

99
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:46,000
He is going home

100
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
He is going home

101
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Thank you

102
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
He is really fast

103
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I want to do it

104
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
You want to do it?

105
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Yes

106
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
There are a lot of things

107
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
My character is Taiyaki

108
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Look at his face

109
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Thank you

110
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Thank you

111
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
My character is Taiyaki

112
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Thank you

113
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I think he will get it

114
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Excuse me

115
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I am not a manager

116
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I heard that you gave him the gala

117
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I was wondering what you were thinking

118
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I was wondering what you were thinking

119
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,000
He also asked me to do it

120
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I didn't think it would be this easy

121
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I am not a manager

122
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I thought it would be easy

123
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I didn't think it would be easy

124
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I was wondering what you were thinking

125
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I was wondering what you were thinking

126
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I thought it would be easy

127
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,000
He gave a big applause to the three fighters.

128
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
If you sell, what do you want to do?

129
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I'm good at singing, so I want to release a record.

130
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
You're good at singing?

131
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Can you sing?

132
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I can sing, leave it to me.

133
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
But you said you were good at 180,000 yen.

134
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Kiyoshi Nakajou's lie.

135
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Kiyoshi Nakajou's lie.

136
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Then let's ask the audience who is coming today.

137
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Kiyoshi Nakajou's lie.

138
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Kiyoshi Nakajou's lie.

139
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Where are you coming from?

140
00:08:39,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Kiyoshi Nakajou's lie.

141
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Today's topic is...

142
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Japan passing.

143
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,000
That's because...

144
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
What is that?

145
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,000
According to the court, 200,000 yen is not enough.

146
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
You have more money, don't you?

147
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Money...

148
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Softly...

149
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
The second topic is...

150
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Ogasawara...

151
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Ogasawara style dating.

152
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Miyuki is...

153
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I'm scared.

154
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Miyuki is...

155
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
One foot first.

156
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Ogasawara style dating.

157
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Moutakuto and the Cultural Revolution.

158
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Edison was...

159
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
On Moutakuto's knee...

160
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Why are you talking about Edison?

161
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
We were talking about 2039.

162
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:29,000
It was a story that I haven't seen yet.

163
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Kokon Tozai.

164
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I'm so scared.

165
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
In the masterpiece Kokon Tozai...

166
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
It is a dialogue with Matsuo, who remains in the Japanese comedy market.

167
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
It is a dialogue with Matsuo, who remains in the Japanese comedy market.

168
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
It is a dialogue with Matsuo, who remains in the Japanese comedy market.

169
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Something is shining.

170
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,000
It's a Japanese character.

171
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I'm scared.

172
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I'm scared.

173
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I'm going to be scolded by my mother.

174
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Matsuo.

175
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Matsuo.

176
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Matsuo is crying.

177
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
And then...

178
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
The name of the member of Pintosu changed.

179
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
The name of the member of Pintosu changed.

180
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Golbatto.

181
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I'm sorry.

182
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
It was amazing.

183
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
It was smelly.

184
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
What?

185
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Buttocks.

186
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:58,000
It was my first time using it.

187
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
There were many things.

188
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I was surprised.

189
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I was surprised by the dog.

190
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
It wasn't a special dog.

191
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:15,000
But a clever dog just três walks along.

192
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
There are a lot of dogs.

193
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
His house is just across from here.

194
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:29,000
It's surprising that he barked at Jimmy.

195
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
It's amazing that I won't be scolded by a dog.

196
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
He barked a lot.

197
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I found out later that he was a good dog.

198
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
He barked a lot.

199
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I thought he was a good dog.

200
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
After I found out that he was all prepared.

201
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
What is he talking about?

202
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I don't know what he is talking about.

203
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Dogs are not prepared.

204
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
They are just born.

205
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
That's right.

206
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
It's difficult.

207
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
What is difficult?

208
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
The dog.

209
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
You were wet.

210
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
You were caught in the net.

211
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
You were caught in the net.

212
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Were you scared?

213
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I don't know where the pee leaked.

214
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
When I touched it, I saw it.

215
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
It was wet.

216
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
It's more interesting to see Jimmy in the V.

217
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
It's more interesting to see Jimmy in the V.

218
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
What is that?

219
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Jimmy in the V is interesting.

220
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
What is that?

221
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
What is that?

222
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
What is that?

223
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
What is that?

224
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
What is that?

225
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
What is that?

226
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
When did you do that?

227
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
In 1994,

228
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Yamazaki Hosei and his team

229
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
released a big hit series.

230
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
The talent of Jimmy Onishi

231
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
became popular at once.

232
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,000
He became one of the top ones with a big success.

233
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
His cross between the Jimmy vs. Yamazaki

234
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:11,680
and his

235
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
A bit difficult.

236
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:20,000
igramm

237
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I hate you!

238
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I hate you too.

239
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
What's with your face?

240
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I'm not going to give you anything.

241
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I'm not going to give you anything.

242
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I don't know you! Look at me!

243
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
If you're going to do it, then do it!

244
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Hey!

245
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Look at me!

246
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
It's hot!

247
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
It's hot!

248
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
It's hot!

249
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
The tweezers!

250
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
The tweezers.

251
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
That's what I'm talking about.

252
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Hold him!

253
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
If he comes out, it's over.

254
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Stand up!

255
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Do it from the inside.

256
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Do it from the inside.

257
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Why are you letting go?

258
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Let's go!

259
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Let's go!

260
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
It's hot!

261
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
It's hot!

262
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
It's hot!

263
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
What is this?

264
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
What is this?

265
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
You're a human!

266
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
You did it!

267
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Look at the camera!

268
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
What?

269
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
What are you doing?

270
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
It's hot!

271
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
It's hot!

272
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:20,000
It's hot!

273
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
It's hot!

274
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
It's hot!

275
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
It's beautiful!

276
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:40,000
In 1995, the talent of Jimmy Onishi, who was born in Yamazaki, entered the entertainment industry.

277
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
He developed his mental state.

278
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Musical Adventure 95 Summer I

279
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
You did it, didn't you?

280
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
It's a bubble.

281
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Amazing.

282
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
The light is leaking.

283
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Whose room is this?

284
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Oh!

285
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Romeo!

286
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Romeo!

287
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Why are you Romeo?

288
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Come up here.

289
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
And hold me.

290
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Right now.

291
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Romeo!

292
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I don't know!

293
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
What?

294
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I don't know!

295
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I don't know!

296
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I don't know!

297
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I don't know!

298
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Aucha Mardin!

299
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
And they all barged in.

300
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,000
O-Ri-Kai-San

301
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
O-Ri-Kai-San

302
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
O-Ri-Kai-San

303
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:10,000
O-Ri-Kai-San

304
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
He's a monster!

305
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
He's a monster!

306
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Scary, scary, scary.

307
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
In the Gaginotsukai special, the life of the child is revealed.

308
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:34,000
At the Hong Kong hotel, Hamada Masatoshi's report shows his honest charm.

309
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:40,000
He made us feel a familiar face.

310
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
He's a monster!

311
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
He's a monster!

312
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:10,000
He's a monster!

313
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

314
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Good morning.

315
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,000
He's a monster!

316
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
That was the best way to fall for it.

317
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Ouch!

318
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,000
He's a monster!

319
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,000
For four years, the Gaginotsukai has been walking with Onishi.

320
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:07,000
We will never forget the joy of spending the shining season with you.

321
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:12,000
That smile, that voice, that warmth.

322
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Even if you're far away, I hope you don't forget.

323
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Jimmy Onishi.

324
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Because you're an irreplaceable friend.

325
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Jimmy is really funny.

326
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Yamazaki and Jimmy thought it would be a long time.

327
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
That's what they said.

328
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
They were so excited.

329
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Jimmy really hated me for that.

330
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
He hated me for acting, acting, and playing.

331
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
So when I went to America, he said,

332
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
I'm going to go play, but I'm not going to come alone.

333
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Really?

334
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Yes.

335
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
But I don't want you to come.

336
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Why?

337
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
It's okay.

338
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
That was just a comparison.

339
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,000
But it's okay.

340
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Ouch! My chin hurts!

341
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
My chin hurts!

342
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
You can't do that!

343
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
It hurts!

344
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I don't know what's going on.

345
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
But it's okay.

346
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
It's time to leave.

347
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Thank you very much.

348
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Thank you very much.

349
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Jimmy, it's time to leave.

350
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Thank you very much.

351
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Thank you very much.

352
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Thank you very much.

353
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
It's time to leave.

354
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,000
I'd like you to run through Virgin Road.

355
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Take care and go to America.

356
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Thank you very much.

357
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
See you again.

358
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
See you again.

359
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Thank you very much.

360
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Hey!

361
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Jimmy!

362
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Jimmy!

363
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I knew this would happen.

364
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Hiro! Hiro!

365
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Why would you do something like this to me?

366
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
I'm so happy.

367
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
I thought it was an egg.

368
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
I can't leave an egg.

369
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Do you want to put it back next year?

370
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
I'm done with you.

371
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
It's cold.

372
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
It's cold.

373
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
It's cold.

374
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
This is a big deal.

375
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
We don't have that kind of money.

376
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
I'm glad it wasn't that much.

377
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
What a way to say it.

378
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
It's cold.

379
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
It's cold.

380
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
