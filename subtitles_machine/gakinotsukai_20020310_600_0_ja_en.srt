1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Today is a special day.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Today is a special day.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I'll buy you something.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Mr. Suga will give you a big present.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Really?

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
It's perfect.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
The prize is 3 million yen.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
3 million yen?

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Why?

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
It's a 600th anniversary.

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Really?

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
It's a 3 million yen prize.

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
It's a 3 million yen prize.

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
If it's 3 million yen,

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
it's a lot of money.

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
It's 1 million yen.

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Is that so?

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Everyone will do their best, right?

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The prize is 100, 100,

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
40, 40.

21
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Why?

22
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
It's the same if you put it here.

23
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
424.

24
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
That's right.

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
This program is

26
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
brought to you by the producer.

27
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Don't say such a thing.

28
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
This person is

29
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
the mirror of the producer.

30
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
That's amazing.

31
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
What do you get for that?

32
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
That's right.

33
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
It's a really

34
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
simple game.

35
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Is this okay?

36
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Really?

37
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Really?

38
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I wanted to give it to you.

39
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
That's right.

40
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I have something to do,

41
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
so I have to go.

42
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Do you have money?

43
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
That's amazing.

44
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Wait a minute.

45
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'll leave this to Kobayashi.

46
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Kobayashi,

47
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm doing this to give it to you.

48
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I see.

49
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I think you'll press the recording button,

50
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
so you can use this.

51
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I can get a lot of money.

52
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
That's right.

53
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
We already have that much.

54
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
So,

55
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I'm sorry.

56
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'm sorry.

57
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
It's okay.

58
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I'll give it to you.

59
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I'll give it to you.

60
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
It's a prize.

61
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Thank you.

62
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Thank you.

63
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Thank you.

64
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
That's amazing.

65
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I don't know how many producers are in Japan.

66
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
That's amazing.

67
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
It's okay.

68
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I'm doing it now.

69
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Then, do it.

70
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I'll get it.

71
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I'm so lucky.

72
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
The first time,

73
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
the prize is 3 million yen.

74
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Last of Mumble

75
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
3rd match.

76
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
It's 3 million yen.

77
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
It's 3 million yen.

78
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
It's 3 million yen.

79
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Thank you.

80
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I'll do it.

81
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I'll go to eat a puffer fish.

82
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I'll tell you the rules again.

83
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Let's do it together.

84
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Let's clear the game.

85
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
You can get 1 million yen for each game.

86
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
That's amazing.

87
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
There are three in total.

88
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
If you succeed in three,

89
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
you'll get 3 million yen.

90
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
It's an easy game.

91
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
It's easy.

92
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Let's start the game.

93
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Here it is.

94
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
If you collect 50 videos in 3 minutes,

95
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
you'll get 1 million yen.

96
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Is this the end?

97
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
If you collect 50 videos in 3 minutes,

98
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
you'll get 1 million yen.

99
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
It's easy.

100
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
You don't even need 3 minutes.

101
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
It's amazing how much Suga tried to give.

102
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
It's amazing.

103
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
If 5 people line up,

104
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
you'll get 1 million yen.

105
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Thank you.

106
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Let's do it.

107
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Let's do it.

108
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Be careful.

109
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Ready.

110
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Go.

111
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
You don't have to be in a hurry.

112
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Slowly.

113
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Wait a minute.

114
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Okay.

115
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Let's do the end.

116
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
You can do it.

117
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
You can't run away.

118
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I got this.

119
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I got this.

120
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
You're too close.

121
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
You're too close.

122
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Wait a minute.

123
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
There's still time.

124
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
You're too close.

125
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
You're too close.

126
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
You can do it.

127
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
You can do it.

128
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Wait a minute.

129
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Hey, Aoka!

130
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Don't lean against the wall.

131
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Don't lean against it.

132
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Hey,

133
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
you're not good at this.

134
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
You're not good at this.

135
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
You're not good at it.

136
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
You're not good at it.

137
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
You're not good at it.

138
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Aoka!

139
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
It's okay.

140
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
It's okay.

141
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
This is the last one.

142
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I'm sorry.

143
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
It's over.

144
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Excuse me.

145
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Hey.

146
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
You should have put the cable on.

147
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Hey.

148
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Hey.

149
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Red one.

150
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
You should have put the camera on.

151
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Red one.

152
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
What is that?

153
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
There's no reason to say that.

154
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
There are three cameras.

155
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
He was doing like this.

156
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
That's not good.

157
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
That's not good.

158
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Do it again.

159
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Rules are rules.

160
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
What do you mean?

161
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Rules are rules.

162
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
It's my fault.

163
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Yes.

164
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
We did it.

165
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
But rules are rules.

166
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
You got in the way.

167
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Who is that?

168
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I don't care.

169
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
There are two more.

170
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
You can take two hundred.

171
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Hey.

172
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
You shouldn't have put it in.

173
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Right?

174
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
It's dirty.

175
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
You're not good at it.

176
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I'm not good at it.

177
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
You're not good at anything.

178
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
You're right.

179
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,000
If you eat 100 bowls of bowl soba in 3 minutes, you'll get 1 million yen.

180
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
It's only 3 minutes.

181
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I think it's more expensive than before.

182
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:28,000
If you eat 100 bowls of bowl soba in 5 minutes, you can eat 20 bowls of bowl soba.

183
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
It's only 3 minutes.

184
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I can do it.

185
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
You can do it.

186
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
If I say yes, will you put it in?

187
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Raise your hand.

188
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Yes.

189
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Okay.

190
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Let's do it.

191
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Let's do it quickly.

192
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Let's get it.

193
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
It's about this amount.

194
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
It's a little less.

195
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Are you ready?

196
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Please put it in.

197
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I'm ready.

198
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Let's do it.

199
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Ready.

200
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Ready.

201
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
It's hard.

202
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Okay.

203
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Auntie, hurry up.

204
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Let's do it quickly.

205
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Auntie.

206
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Auntie.

207
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Here's the bowl.

208
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Here's the bowl.

209
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Hurry up.

210
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Auntie.

211
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Auntie.

212
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Hurry up.

213
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Soba.

214
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Soba.

215
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Come on, Grandma.

216
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Come on.

217
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Hurry up.

218
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
You shouldn't do that.

219
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Hurry up.

220
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Hurry up.

221
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Hurry up.

222
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
You're not using your hands properly.

223
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Hurry up.

224
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
You did good.

225
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
You're doing great.

226
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Grandma, hurry up.

227
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Soba-chan, Soba-chan

228
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Hey, what are you doing?

229
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Put in the soba

230
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
This is impossible

231
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Here you go, Soba-chan

232
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Give me the soba

233
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
What is this?

234
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Can't you eat this?

235
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Give me the soba

236
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Soba, soba, soba

237
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Give me the soba

238
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
What are you doing?

239
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Time's up

240
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Hey, hey

241
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
It's hard to get another 100,000

242
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
But I'll do my best

243
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I'll reset it and do it again

244
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Time's up

245
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I'm hungry

246
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
You can't eat this

247
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
You can't eat this

248
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I don't want to do this

249
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Thank you for your hard work

250
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
You can't eat this

251
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
You can't

252
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
You're the last one

253
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
It's been a while since I watched the first and the middle

254
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Since you're back, let's go to the next game

255
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
It's for me

256
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
That's right

257
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
It's for me

258
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
It's been a while since I said it

259
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
It's been 10 years since I said it

260
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Okay, time's up

261
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
The last game is

262
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
If you can get 10 soba in 3 minutes, you win

263
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I'm counting on you

264
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
It's been 3 minutes

265
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Let's get this

266
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Okay

267
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Let's go

268
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Ready

269
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Put it in the basket

270
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Put it in the basket

271
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Put it in the basket

272
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I caught it

273
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
What are you doing?

274
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
What are you doing?

275
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
What are you doing?

276
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
What are you doing?

277
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
What are you doing?

278
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Put it in

279
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Put it in

280
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Let's catch it

281
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Put it out

282
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Put it out

283
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Put it out

284
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I caught it

285
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
You're amazing

286
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Time's up

287
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Hey

288
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Hey

289
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Hey

290
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Hey

291
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Hey

292
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Hey

293
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Hey

294
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Hey

295
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Hey

296
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Hey

297
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Hey

298
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Hey

299
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Hey

300
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Why?

301
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I don't know

302
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Why are you making so much noise?

303
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Today

304
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I'm fine

305
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Why are you so fine?

306
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I don't know

307
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I don't know if you look like him

308
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I don't think you know him yet

309
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I don't feel good

310
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I don't feel good

311
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
The other day

312
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I was so hungry

313
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I was driving around Shibuya

314
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
There's a selfie video, right?

315
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Yes

316
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I'm not going

317
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Really?

318
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Let's go

319
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
No

320
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I'm not interested

321
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I was just going to take a picture of you

322
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
When I went in

323
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
There's a movie

324
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I was just going to take a picture of you

325
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I knew everything

326
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I was just going to take a picture of you

327
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I knew everything

328
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
When I went in

329
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Everything was erotic

330
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Right?

331
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
From the video

332
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
To the DVD

333
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Everything was erotic

334
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I thought it was amazing

335
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
You were happy

336
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I was happy

337
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I was happy

338
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Right?

339
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I looked at it

340
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I was surprised

341
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I was surprised

342
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
My teacher

343
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Black

344
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I took a picture of his face

345
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I took a picture of his face

346
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I took a picture of his face

347
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
My lips were open

348
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Maru

349
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Also my recommendation

350
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
No

351
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
It's strange

352
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
En

353
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Is there a video that we can feel satisfied with

354
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I don't know what you want to feel satisfied with

355
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Conf eigen or something

356
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I was so happy

357
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
It's not like that

358
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
No

359
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
No, no, this is...

360
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Take this!

361
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
It's the same!

362
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
So what did you do?

363
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I said,

364
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I can't do this, I can't do this.

365
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
But I said,

366
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I'll say it, even if you say it on purpose,

367
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I'll become a shop assistant again.

368
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I'll say it,

369
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I'll say it.

370
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
So I said,

371
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I'm counting on you.

372
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I said,

373
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I'm counting on you.

374
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
No, no, I did buy it in Japan.

375
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I bought it without a doubt.

376
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
But that's not really a matcha corner.

377
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
That's a picture.

378
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I was waiting for it to come.

379
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I did buy it,

380
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
and I went to the store.

381
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
But the matcha corner is

382
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
a bit strange, right?

383
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
No, no, no,

384
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
because you say it like that,

385
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
people think you're a representative of eroticism.

386
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
It's like a sex symbol.

387
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I don't know if it's a symbol or not.

388
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
It's just an image.

389
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
No, no, no, it's you!

390
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
It's you!

391
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
It feels like you're borrowing eroticism.

392
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
You!

393
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Wait, wait, wait.

394
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
You haven't seen it, right?

395
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
You haven't seen the one I chose, right?

396
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
You're taking a picture, right?

397
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
No, no, no.

398
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
You're making me angry.

399
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
It's strange,

400
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
but I can't help it.

401
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Why is it me?

402
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Some people are saying

403
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
that I went to a magazine

404
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
and went to a club.

405
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
It's written all over the place.

406
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
By the way, here's a matcha from downtown.

407
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I don't know.

408
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Why?

409
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Because you went.

410
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Even if you didn't go there,

411
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
you went somewhere else, right?

412
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I'm telling you,

413
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I didn't go to a club

414
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
like the average Japanese guy.

415
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
No, no, no, no.

416
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
You didn't see it, right?

417
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
You didn't see it, right?

418
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
No, no, no, no.

419
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I'm telling you.

420
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I have that image.

421
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I'm telling you.

422
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I'm telling you.

423
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I'm telling you.

424
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I'm telling you.

425
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I'm telling you.

426
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
It's completely different.

427
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
It's completely different.

428
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
You've never been

429
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
kicked in the butt with your fingers?

430
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
No, I've never been there.

431
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
You've been there, right?

432
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
No, I haven't.

433
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
That's not good.

434
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
You did it.

435
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I'm not saying it's not good.

436
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I'm telling you.

437
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I have that image.

438
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I'm telling you.

439
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I'm telling you.

440
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I've never been kicked in the butt in an AV

441
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Why do you have that image?

442
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
You won't be in the movie

443
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
because you are the one that gets kicked in the butt.

444
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Okay, so that's your thoughts.

445
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I don't have any tits.

446
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I'm always in the certain way.

447
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Like a boiled egg.

448
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
K 20 THOUSAND

449
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I have something to tell you.

450
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
What is it?

451
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Do you have money?

452
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Of course I have money.

453
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
How much did I make this year?

454
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
What are you talking about?

455
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
It's a little bit of a competition.

456
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I see.

457
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I see.

458
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
That's what we're talking about.

459
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I'm trying to figure it out somehow.

460
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
If you have something to say, say it.

461
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I'm going to run and fly.

462
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I see.

463
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Fly.

464
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Why are you going to fly again?

465
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Because I'm confident.

466
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I think I can fly 4-5 meters easily.

467
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
You can fly 5 meters?

468
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I think I can fly.

469
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
5 meters?

470
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I think I can fly.

471
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I'm sorry, but...

472
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I think I can fly 3-4 meters at most.

473
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
No, no, no.

474
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,000
If you're going to fly, you need one major.

475
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
That's what I thought.

476
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
It's a long story, though.

477
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Don't say that.

478
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
So!

479
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
It's 4 against 1.

480
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,000
There's a reason why I can't continue.

481
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
But if I continue,

482
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
You guys are four, right?

483
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I'm the only one, right?

484
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
You guys can fly four times, right?

485
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I see.

486
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,000
To be honest, I can beat you guys just by flying three times.

487
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Why?

488
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Because I'm a spring man.

489
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
A spring man of fear.

490
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,000
That's not fear.

491
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
That's what I think.

492
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
That's what I think, but...

493
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
You seem confident.

494
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I'm confident, but...

495
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I'm a little scared.

496
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Flying four times is...

497
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,000
The first and second times, I think I can easily fly over 4 meters.

498
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
But flying three times and four times...

499
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Even if I say so, it's 42 meters.

500
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Who said that?

501
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Who said that?

502
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
38 meters.

503
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
With this 38-year-old body,

504
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Can you fly four times?

505
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I see.

506
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I'm a little scared of that.

507
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I see.

508
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
No, no, no.

509
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
It's okay to fly four times.

510
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I have to fly only three times.

511
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
What?

512
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Really?

513
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Yes.

514
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
I'll definitely win.

515
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
But I don't know.

516
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Really?

517
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Really?

518
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
No, really.

519
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Well, shall we call the three of them?

520
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:28,000
No, no, no.

521
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I'm not surprised.

522
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
It's better to fly four times.

523
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Well, but...

524
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Well, that's it.

525
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Well, I can fly four times.

526
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I can fly four meters.

527
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I can fly four times.

528
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Listen!

529
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
What are you doing?

530
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Is it a party?

531
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Who do you think can fly?

532
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
What is it?

533
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I'll definitely win.

534
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
No, if it's 44 meters, I'll definitely win.

535
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
44 meters?

536
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Four times at a time, right?

537
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
How many meters can you fly?

538
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Maybe 3 meters and 20 meters.

539
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I think I can fly that much.

540
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Right?

541
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
And 2 meters and 50 meters.

542
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
You can't fly at all.

543
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
You're kidding me, right?

544
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I'm really good at jumping.

545
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Really?

546
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
No, I was doing kendo.

547
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
What?

548
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Kendo.

549
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
It doesn't really matter.

550
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
No, it doesn't matter.

551
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Hey!

552
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Come here!

553
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
This is...

554
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
What are you doing?

555
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:38,000
I can fly kendo.

556
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
I can fly a lot of things.

557
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
I want to fly more.

558
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
You want to fly more?

559
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Well, 3 meters...

560
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Let's say 3 meters and 50 meters.

561
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
3 meters and 50 meters.

562
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,000
How much is 3 meters and 50 times 4?

563
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
14 meters.

564
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
14 meters, right?

565
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
I'll definitely go over 4 meters.

566
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
4 meters is 16, so it's 16 meters.

567
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
That means I've already won.

568
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
And Tanaka...

569
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,000
This is a bit of a joke, right?

570
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I think I can fly.

571
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I think I can walk in the air.

572
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Really?

573
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
If you do that, it'll be weird.

574
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
I think I can do it for a while.

575
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
I think I can do it for a while.

576
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Don't say that.

577
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
When you try to fly forward, you're an amateur, right?

578
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
That's not true.

579
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
It's the time you spend in the air.

580
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,000
You have speed, so even if you just fly up, you can move forward.

581
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:40,000
So the point is how much time you spend in the air.

582
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Even in the previous match, I was so confident that I couldn't even swim 50 meters.

583
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
I couldn't even score a goal.

584
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,000
It's not that you couldn't swim, but your eyeballs were about to pop out.

585
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Why did you do that?

586
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,000
I was suffering so much that my eyeballs were about to pop out.

587
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
But it was okay to do it.

588
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
But when I went up, the drone came out.

589
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Can you do it?

590
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
No, I can't blur it.

591
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Even if you can blur it, there's a drone around here.

592
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
There's a blind spot.

593
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
What did you think?

594
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
That's not good.

595
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
If you have a problem, you can fly over there.

596
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
But I can fly four times.

597
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
You can fly five times, and I can fly four times.

598
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,000
That's perfect.

599
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,000
I'm sorry, but I'll decide the other one.

600
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
For example?

601
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
For example, the one that's the most popular right now is Heipo.

602
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
That's definitely not good.

603
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
That's definitely not good.

604
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Heipo Uchiyama-kun.

605
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Uchiyama-kun.

606
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Uchiyama-kun.

607
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,000
I'll leave it at that.

608
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Then, Heipo-san, over there.

609
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
You mean you're going to fly four times?

610
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Heipo will fly once every four times.

611
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
That's what it means.

612
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
I'll fly three times.

613
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
I'll fly four times.

614
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
I don't know.

615
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
I'll move a little bit, so maybe...

616
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Don't you feel like you're going to fly sideways?

617
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Scary!

618
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
What's scary?

619
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Scary!

620
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
You can't fly wide?

621
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
I'll just let it go and fly.

622
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Then let's fly wide.

623
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Are you sure?

624
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
I'll fly really far.

625
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Then fly really far.

626
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
I think it's going to be amazing.

627
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Even if you don't fly wide.

628
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Everyone says that about eight times a month.

629
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
I'll say it a little more.

630
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
I'll say it a little more.

631
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
I'll say it a little more.

632
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
After I get home, I'll be saying it in a weird way.

633
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Even if you don't fly wide.

634
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,000
That's going to be a trend this year.

635
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Even if you don't fly wide.

636
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:18,000
