1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Who said that?

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
What was that?

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
What was it?

4
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Wasn't there a time when the mic was really smelly?

5
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
The mic?

6
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
We were talking like this.

7
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Normally people wouldn't have a mic, but...

8
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Why didn't you put it on like this and talk?

9
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
But Kouhun-san put it on a lot and talked.

10
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
At the concert, right?

11
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Everyone was like, wow.

12
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
There was a lot of noise.

13
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
We were pretty close, and everyone was like, wow.

14
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
We were like, this is the best!

15
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
But it was the worst!

16
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
This is...

17
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
This is...

18
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
This is the worst!

19
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Definitely.

20
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Well, I understand that.

21
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
No, no, no.

22
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'll tell you.

23
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Can I really say that?

24
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
What do you mean?

25
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Can I really say that?

26
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
No, no, you have to tell me.

27
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I was born like this.

28
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I don't know anyone who is this smelly.

29
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Is that what I should say?

30
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Yes, yes, yes.

31
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
You have to say that.

32
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Can I really say that?

33
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
No, you have to say that.

34
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Well, then...

35
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
You have to say that.

36
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I don't know if I've already fixed it, but...

37
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
It was amazing!

38
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Until last year.

39
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
What was it like?

40
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Well, it was like...

41
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I had a bit of a toothache.

42
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I had a bit of a toothache.

43
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I had a bit of a toothache.

44
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I had a bit of a toothache.

45
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I had a bit of a toothache.

46
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I had a bit of a toothache.

47
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Seriously.

48
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Well, you know...

49
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
When you call the guests...

50
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Yes?

51
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Well, you know...

52
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Everyone knows.

53
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Really?

54
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Yes.

55
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
It's amazing.

56
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Well, I think...

57
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
If you call them here and make them stand there...

58
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Everyone will know.

59
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Really?

60
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Well, when you say, haaaaa...

61
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Everyone goes, waaaa...

62
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Well, when you call the guests...

63
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
They just talk normally, right?

64
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
That's right.

65
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
They don't say haaaaa, do they?

66
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
They don't say that.

67
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
They don't say that, but...

68
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Everyone goes, waaaa...

69
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
It's amazing.

70
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
And then, someone...

71
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Well, you know...

72
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
A companion or something...

73
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Told me...

74
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Seriously...

75
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Don't make a big deal out of it.

76
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
That was the last thing I said.

77
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
What did you say?

78
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Well, then...

79
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I started to worry about it.

80
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Well, before the actual performance...

81
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I eat ginseng.

82
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I eat things like that.

83
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
But...

84
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
It's not something I hate so much that I lose to ginseng.

85
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
So, that ginseng...

86
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I put it in my mouth.

87
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I see.

88
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I said something really amazing.

89
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
When I try to talk...

90
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Everyone goes, waaaa...

91
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
That's funny.

92
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
That's right.

93
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
That's right.

94
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
That's right.

95
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Right?

96
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
If you talk with your true feelings, it becomes like this.

97
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
No, but that's fine.

98
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I don't care.

99
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
For someone who's only here...

100
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Yeah, well...

101
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
What makes a man so excited?

102
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
What makes a man so excited?

103
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Hmm?

104
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
What do you think?

105
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Well, I don't really...

106
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
You don't, right?

107
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I don't either.

108
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
But...

109
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
It's like, hey!

110
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
And you get excited?

111
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Why do I get excited?

112
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Well, I want to know too.

113
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Actually...

114
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Rather...

115
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I'm a bit of a loser.

116
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I see.

117
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Well...

118
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Because, you know...

119
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
A leopard...

120
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
It stinks!

121
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Well...

122
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
The truth is...

123
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Well...

124
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
That's true, but...

125
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
From a leopard's perspective...

126
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
A real leopard doesn't smell.

127
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Like, it stinks.

128
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Well, that's true, but...

129
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I have something like that.

130
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Trauma.

131
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Trauma?

132
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
A leopard stinks.

133
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Oh, really?

134
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
That's my wife's habit.

135
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Oh, really?

136
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Yeah.

137
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Hey, wake up!

138
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
You have to eat breakfast, or you'll get sick!

139
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
What are you talking about?

140
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
What?

141
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I don't know what you're saying.

142
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I don't know what you're saying.

143
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I don't know what you're saying.

144
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Hey, you!

145
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Yes.

146
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Hey, wake up!

147
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
You have to eat breakfast, or you'll get sick!

148
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
You stink!

149
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I'm sorry.

150
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
But, you don't understand...

151
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
From my point of view...

152
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
From my point of view...

153
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
A man should be strong.

154
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I see.

155
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
That's what I think.

156
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
And I want to make strong things stronger.

157
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I want to be stronger than strong things.

158
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
That's what I think.

159
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
So, I want to write on a piece of paper.

160
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I want to ride on a piece of paper.

161
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I want to hold down a piece of paper.

162
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Probably.

163
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
That's different from excitement.

164
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
That...

165
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
That's like Zebra.

166
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
You don't understand that.

167
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Zebra is weak.

168
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I see.

169
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I want to beat Zebra.

170
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I want to be the target.

171
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
You don't understand this.

172
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
So, in the end...

173
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
In the end?

174
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
In the end...

175
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I think you've been here since your past life.

176
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
What do you mean?

177
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
You've been here since your past life.

178
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
My past life was the opposite of the target.

179
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
People get excited when they see that.

180
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
So, my past life was...

181
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
It was a hunting tribe.

182
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
A hunting tribe.

183
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Yes, yes.

184
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
But, people like us who don't get excited when they see the Zebra pattern...

185
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
We are a rich people.

186
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I see.

187
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
So, when we see the Chinese cabbage pattern...

188
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
We get excited.

189
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
When we see the Chinese cabbage pattern...

190
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
When we see the Chinese cabbage pattern...

191
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
We get excited.

192
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
But, if we see it, we get excited.

193
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
If we wear it...

194
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
After we take it off, we don't look at it.

195
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
We don't look at it.

196
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
We don't look at it.

197
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
People say, I'm over here.

198
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
What are you talking about?

199
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I think there is a difference between a rich people and a hunting tribe.

200
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
We are a rich people.

201
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
But, there are people who get excited when they see it.

202
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
That's right.

203
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Wow, it's a Zebra pattern.

204
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
It's a Zebra pattern.

205
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
You used to put a Zebra pattern in your phone, didn't you?

206
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
In my phone?

207
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Yes.

208
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
What is that?

209
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
It's hard to understand.

210
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
What is?

211
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
It's written in my name.

212
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Did you wear a Zebra patterned clothes?

213
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I did.

214
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
It's a Zebra pattern.

215
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Even if it's a Zebra pattern, it's a Zebra pattern.

216
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
It's different.

217
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
That's right.

218
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
What is that?

219
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
It's a big Zebra pattern.

220
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
It's a big Zebra pattern.

221
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Even if you are a baseball player...

222
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
It's a big Zebra pattern.

223
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Yes.

224
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
If you don't explain it like that, it will be hard to understand.

225
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I see.

226
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
But, when you have to call it a Zebra pattern...

227
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
The voice reaction...

228
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Zebra pattern, Chichi.

229
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
You can say Chichi.

230
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
If you can only say Zebra pattern...

231
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,000
If you can only say Zebra pattern, Chichi.

232
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Mr. Matsumoto, during the game, you were laughing half-heartedly.

233
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Please tell us more about that death match.

234
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Well, I did a lot of death matches.

235
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
It's a death match.

236
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
It's a death match.

237
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Isn't it a great game?

238
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
It's a battle of death.

239
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
But, you were laughing half-heartedly?

240
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
All the time.

241
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Yes.

242
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I don't feel nervous at all.

243
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Who did you play against?

244
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
It was Lou Tez.

245
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
You...

246
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
How old are you?

247
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
How many years?

248
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
How long have you been talking about me?

249
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
About 20 years.

250
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
20 years?

251
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
That was 20 years ago.

252
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I was in high school.

253
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
That's right.

254
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
That's why I was called a young high school student.

255
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
That's right.

256
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
That was a big death match.

257
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Is that so?

258
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Yes.

259
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
So, now I'm talking about Kanaami and others.

260
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
But, to me, it's a silly thing.

261
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
It's not a big deal to avoid it.

262
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Really?

263
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Yes.

264
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
What kind of rules?

265
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
What I did was a birthday death match.

266
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
This is...

267
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I was laughing half-heartedly while fighting.

268
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Because there were people who were celebrating with me.

269
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
So...

270
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I was going to go and fight.

271
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
But, I got a present.

272
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I was going to go and fight.

273
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
But, I got a present.

274
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
It was an intense fight.

275
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Lou Tez is Lou Tez.

276
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Lou Tez is the same person.

277
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Why are there no fat people in ghosts?

278
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Well...

279
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Even if you watch a movie or a drama,

280
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
if you see a ghost in a scene,

281
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
there will always be a thin person with a pale face.

282
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Originally, there is a ghost of a pig.

283
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
But, it comes out.

284
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Some people can see ghosts,

285
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
but some people can't.

286
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Most people can't see ghosts.

287
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
The other day, I...

288
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Maybe I saw a ghost.

289
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Are you serious?

290
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I'm serious.

291
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
What?

292
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Really, I saw a ghost.

293
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Your voice is small.

294
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
That story...

295
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Do you want to hear it?

296
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I'm a little scared.

297
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I don't know if it's true or not.

298
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I was sleeping alone.

299
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I was sleeping facing this way.

300
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
There was a kotatsu and a chair here.

301
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I was sleeping like this.

302
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
When I looked this way,

303
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
there was a chair...

304
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I'm scared.

305
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I'm scared.

306
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
It's okay.

307
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
There was a chair with a round cell.

308
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
A child ran away.

309
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
That's right.

310
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I'm scared.

311
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
You said that because you wanted to say it.

312
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
It's true.

313
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
You were carrying a round cell.

314
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I was carrying a round cell.

315
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
You were in elementary school.

316
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I wasn't carrying a round cell.

317
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Wait a minute.

318
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
You said you were in elementary school when you first carried a round cell.

319
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Yes, I did.

320
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Now that I think about it, I wasn't carrying a round cell.

321
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
A round cell...

322
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
You were in elementary school, right?

323
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
You were in elementary school when you first carried a round cell.

324
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I wasn't carrying a round cell.

325
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I don't know if you were in elementary school or not.

326
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Then what is it?

327
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Then what is it?

328
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I felt like I was small.

329
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I see.

330
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
You were small, so you were in elementary school.

331
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I was small, so I was in elementary school.

332
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I was in elementary school, so I thought I was carrying a round cell.

333
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
You weren't carrying a round cell.

334
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I wasn't carrying a round cell.

335
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I wasn't carrying a round cell.

336
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
It's ambiguous to say that I was small.

337
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I said that there was a treasure in the kotatsu.

338
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I don't have a treasure.

339
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
You don't have a treasure either?

340
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
To be honest, I don't have a treasure.

341
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I felt like I was sitting.

342
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
In the kotatsu?

343
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
But I thought it would be better to say that I had a treasure.

344
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I see.

345
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I thought so.

346
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
But I felt like I was sitting in the kotatsu.

347
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I felt like I was sitting.

348
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I felt like I was running.

349
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Did you see it clearly?

350
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
No.

351
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Did you see it clearly?

352
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
No.

353
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
It's really the atmosphere.

354
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
The atmosphere?

355
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
When you first said it, you said it was 100%.

356
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
When you first said it, you said it was 100%.

357
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Yes, at that time.

358
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Now, as time goes by, I analyze various things.

359
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
What do you think?

360
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
No.

361
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I wanted to be noticed by everyone.

362
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
You wanted to be noticed?

363
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I may have been noticed.

364
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I see.

365
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
But it's a lie, isn't it?

366
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
It's a lie.

367
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Every year at this time, I heard that you have a habit of digging deeply with a shovel.

368
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
What are you looking for?

369
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
It's a wallet.

370
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
What?

371
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Wallet.

372
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Wallet?

373
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Yes.

374
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Do you dig so deep to look for a wallet?

375
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Yes.

376
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Because I dug in a very deep place.

377
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Why did you dig in such a deep place?

378
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Because I dug in a very deep place with a shovel before.

379
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Then why did you dig?

380
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
What?

381
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Why did you dig in such a deep place?

382
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Because I was looking for a wallet that I had dug before.

383
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I see.

384
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
And I found a wallet that I had dug before.

385
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I see.

386
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
And I found a wallet that I had dug before.

387
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000
And when I was glad to find it, it fell down.

388
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
And I was focused on this side.

389
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
And I said, OK, let's bury it.

390
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,000
And I buried it again.

391
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:01,000
The first wallet you found was in a very deep place.

392
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
And you found it?

393
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Yes.

394
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Look at this.

395
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
You were there too, weren't you?

396
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
You were there too, weren't you?

397
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
What?

398
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
You were there then.

399
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
No, I wasn't.

400
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Tell me.

401
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I don't know!

402
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Why did Mr. Hamada need to make a hole in his mouth?

403
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
To be honest, this is a trauma.

404
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
What?

405
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Trauma.

406
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Me?

407
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Yeah.

408
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Everyone was saying it.

409
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Even in middle school.

410
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
When you weren't there.

411
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
It was like...

412
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,000
When you were off, it became the topic of the class meeting.

413
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Aoki sensei was saying anything.

414
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Let's talk about Hamada with everyone.

415
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
There were so many things to say.

416
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Everyone was crying at the end.

417
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Who would bring bread to Hamada?

418
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
That's what he was saying.

419
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
That was a trauma.

420
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
It's nothing but a trauma.

421
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
What?

422
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
It's nothing but a trauma.

423
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Why is it a trauma?

424
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:24,000
If you say it on TV, you can't support it.

425
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Why?

426
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Is it okay to say it?

427
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
It's the reason why you became an empty mouth.

428
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
That's right.

429
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
There's no reason for that.

430
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Because when I said Hamada-kun, he looked at me.

431
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
What are you talking about?

432
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Then I'll say it.

433
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
My dad is an a**hole.

434
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
What's going on in the center of the giant Tatsumaki?

435
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,000
There's a cause and an action.

436
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Someone is doing it.

437
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
What do you mean someone is doing it?

438
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Someone is doing it.

439
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Someone is doing it.

440
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I saw it.

441
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I can't beat the person who saw it.

442
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Right?

443
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
What's going on?

444
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Is it inside?

445
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Yes.

446
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Is it inside?

447
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
If the inside is outside, I've never seen it.

448
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
If you look at it from above, what's going on in the middle?

449
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Someone is doing it.

450
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
What?

451
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
What?

452
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Someone is doing it.

453
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
What?

454
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Are you an a**hole?

455
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
You know,

456
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
a woman who has a good sense.

457
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
A woman who has about 40 points.

458
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
By herself.

459
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
By herself.

460
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
She's doing that by herself.

461
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
She's throwing her house away by herself.

462
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Why is she doing that?

463
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Why is she doing that?

464
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
What's going on?

465
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
You see,

466
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
there's a lot of things.

467
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Like a backache.

468
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Right?

469
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Since she has about 40 points,

470
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
there's a time when she gets a little popular.

471
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
That's true.

472
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Something like that.

473
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Her breasts are big, right?

474
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
They're pretty big.

475
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Her breasts are pretty big.

476
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
That's right.

477
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,000
And there's a guy who just wants to see her breasts.

478
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I know.

479
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
You don't know?

480
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I'm sorry for hitting you.

481
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
It's hysteria.

482
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
What the hell?

483
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
All of them just passed by me.

484
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
In the end, it's like this.

485
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I thought so.

486
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I got two senses.

487
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
About 40 points.

488
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Who are you?

489
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I'm going to the amusement park with her this time.

490
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
I'm scared of the screaming machine, so I can't ride it.

491
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Please tell me how to refuse a screaming machine that's not cool.

492
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Sure.

493
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I'll tell you.

494
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
It's not cool to refuse a screaming machine.

495
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I can't do that.

496
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Then I'll ride this.

497
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
That's possible.

498
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I'll make her think that way.

499
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
You can't show her that you're a man who can do it.

500
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I see.

501
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
That's right.

502
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
But, you know,

503
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
if she asks you to ride a sword,

504
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
you can't do that.

505
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
You can't do that.

506
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
You have to be confident.

507
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
You have to stand up straight.

508
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Why?

509
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
You have to stand up straight.

510
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
You have to stand up straight.

511
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I'll buy the ticket.

512
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I bought it.

513
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I can buy it, right?

514
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
You can be confident.

515
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I'll go to the front of the ride.

516
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I'll go straight.

517
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
It's the next turn.

518
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Are you going that far?

519
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
You can't go up there.

520
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
It's okay.

521
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
It's okay?

522
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I'm right in front of you.

523
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
What should I do?

524
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
You can do this.

525
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Can I come?

526
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Yes.

527
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
That's good.

528
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
You can do this.

529
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
You should have done this before you left home.

530
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
What are you doing?

531
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
You should have done this at home.

532
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
You can afford to do that.

533
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
It's not a big deal.

534
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I see.

535
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
You're right in front of me.

536
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
What should I do?

537
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
That's right.

538
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
She's already on the ride.

539
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
You can escort her.

540
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
I see.

541
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
What is this?

542
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
You can hold her like this.

543
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
What kind of situation is this?

544
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
She has a lot of power.

545
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I see.

546
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
It's okay.

547
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
She's already on the ride.

548
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I'll sit down.

549
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Hurry up and sit down.

550
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
From there...

551
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
How should I say this?

552
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I'll ride a sports car.

553
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
I see.

554
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I'll ride a sports car.

555
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
I'll ride a sports car.

556
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
You'll ride a sports car?

557
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
I'll ride a sports car.

558
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I'll ride a sports car.

559
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I'll ride a sports car.

560
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Can I get off?

561
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
You can get off.

562
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
What?

563
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
You can't get on.

564
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
I'm scared.

565
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
It's okay.

566
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Really?

567
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Yes.

568
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
It's okay to get on, right?

569
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Of course it's okay.

570
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Of course it's okay.

571
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
I'll sit down.

572
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
You can sit down.

573
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Really?

574
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Like this, right?

575
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
It's okay up to here.

576
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
You can sit down, right?

577
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
It's okay.

578
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
You can't sit down.

579
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
What are you doing?

580
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Hurry up and sit down.

581
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Everyone is lined up.

582
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
That's right.

583
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
What should I do?

584
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
I'll just get off.

585
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
I'll get off.

586
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
You're like a part-time worker.

587
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
You're like a part-time worker.

588
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
I did something like that.

589
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Push.

590
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
I'll get off.

591
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
He got off.

592
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
It's okay.

593
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
The time is not over yet.

594
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Really?

595
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Get off.

596
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Is this okay?

597
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
It's okay.

598
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Is it moving?

599
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
It's moving.

600
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
What should I do?

601
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
So what are you going to do?

602
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Finally, before you come here, I have a lot of nonsense to tell you.

603
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
You...

604
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I don't want to hear that.

605
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
That's right. It's a way of saying no.

606
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I'm listening to your way of saying no.

607
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Yes, please.

608
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
That's right.

609
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Yes, please.

610
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
This is better to tell your friend.

611
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
What?

612
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Give me a call.

613
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Oh, I see.

614
00:21:53,000 --> 00:22:06,000
It's like this.

615
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:24,000
