1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
In the first episode, we're going to play the roulette game!

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Let's all have fun playing roulette!

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Thank you, Kaki!

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
This time, the four roulette players will play a special game!

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
First, you have to decide who you want to play with the rock-paper-scissors.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
There are 8 designated areas.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Then, with the second roulette, you have to decide on the person's costume.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Each person has a unique cosplay.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Then, with the third roulette, you have to decide on the person's actions.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
There are unusual questions prepared.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Then, with the last roulette, you have to decide on the person's eyes.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
The question is the last one, right?

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
You have to decide on the person's face.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:06,000
For example, let's say that Yamazaki is dressed up as Superman in Nakano.

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Then, you have to decide on the scene of the murder.

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Then, you have to decide on the scene of the murder.

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Then, you have to decide on the scene of the murder.

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
The sponsor you are about to see is here.

19
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
This game will continue until 3 out of 5 people get it right.

20
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Please look forward to the punishment video of the person who gets it right.

21
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
First, Kokoriko Tanaka will challenge the roulette.

22
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
The roulette will spin a lot.

23
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I will call Nakano Urai.

24
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
The roulette is spinning.

25
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Shinbashi.

26
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
This game is cold.

27
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
The roulette is spinning.

28
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Kaimun.

29
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,000
This game is cold.

30
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
This game looks like it will last longer.

31
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,000
You are running without rain.

32
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
What is this?

33
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Why are you laughing?

34
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
It's too long

35
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I'm scared

36
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
He barely made it

37
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
He did it

38
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Let's continue

39
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Tanaka Naoki

40
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
In a new horse

41
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
He's wearing a navy uniform

42
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Even though it's not raining

43
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
He's running in a sports newspaper

44
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
And he's laughing

45
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Let's see it

46
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Please

47
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Next is Endo

48
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
The place is a mess

49
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
What about his costume?

50
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
It's open

51
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Candy candy

52
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
This is bad

53
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
It's not hard

54
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
It's cool

55
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
It's safe

56
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Next is Hamada

57
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
What will he do?

58
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Please

59
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
It's open

60
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
He put his one leg in the tofu

61
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
This is bad

62
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
This is bad

63
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
He's laughing

64
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
He's not laughing

65
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
He's not laughing

66
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Next is Matsumoto

67
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
What will he do?

68
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Please

69
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I don't know

70
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
It's open

71
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
It's open

72
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
What are you doing?

73
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Please

74
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I'll do my best

75
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I'll lower the saddle

76
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
And run

77
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I'll do anything

78
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
This is bad

79
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I'll do anything

80
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
This is Tanaka's part

81
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
It's stopped

82
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
It's Tanaka's part

83
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
It's Tanaka's part

84
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
It's Tanaka's part

85
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
He's not here

86
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
What is this?

87
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
What is this?

88
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
He's not here

89
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
The last one is Yamazaki

90
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
He's not here

91
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
He's not here

92
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
He's not here

93
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
He's not here

94
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
He's not here

95
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
What will he do?

96
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
What will he do?

97
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
What will he do?

98
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
This is safe

99
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Go

100
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
The second one

101
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
It's okay

102
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Here

103
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
It's here

104
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
If you go from here, you'll go to the next one

105
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
And Hamada's second one

106
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
And Hamada's second one

107
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Hamada's second one

108
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
It's here

109
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
It's here

110
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I want to see this

111
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
It's here

112
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Please

113
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Please

114
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Please

115
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
It's here

116
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
It's here

117
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
It's here

118
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
And Matsumoto's second one

119
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
And Matsumoto's second one

120
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
And Matsumoto's second one

121
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Matsumoto

122
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Matsumoto

123
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Matsumoto

124
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Matsumoto

125
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Matsumoto

126
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Thank you

127
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
is allemaal

128
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Thank you

129
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Let's do the Jyobachi pose with Odaiba and laugh together with the parachute.

130
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Let's watch it.

131
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:45,000
The last one is Yamazaki's challenge.

132
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,000
It's a gap.

133
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
This is not good for a comedian.

134
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
It's a gap comedian.

135
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
This is not good.

136
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Who will be the last one?

137
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Endo, fate's third throw.

138
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
It's my first time.

139
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
It's like Nakadai Tatsuya.

140
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Go in.

141
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I'm counting on you.

142
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Go in.

143
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Go in.

144
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Go in.

145
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Go in.

146
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Go in.

147
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Go in.

148
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Go in.

149
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Go in.

150
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Go in.

151
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Go in.

152
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Go in.

153
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Go in.

154
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Go in.

155
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Go in.

156
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Go in.

157
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Go in.

158
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Go to the environment.

159
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Go out.

160
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
What?

161
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Hamada, who was relieved that three people had been chosen,

162
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
What? One more person?

163
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
What is it, Mr. Hamada?

164
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Who are you asking?

165
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Who is it?

166
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
One more person!

167
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Who is it?

168
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
It doesn't matter if it's that person.

169
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
It's Irie-chan again!

170
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
It's Irie-chan again!

171
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
It's Irie-chan again!

172
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
That gap, that gap.

173
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Matsumoto, who is trying to fit Hamada,

174
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
and the fourth generation of roulette.

175
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Are you laughing?

176
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Isn't that strange?

177
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I want to point it out.

178
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Hamada, I've made an item like this.

179
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
What is it?

180
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
You're laughing twice as much!

181
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Hamada and Yamazaki's one-on-one battle.

182
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
First of all, Hamada can't lose even if he wants to.

183
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
It's from that old movie.

184
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
This is also nostalgic.

185
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I'll never say it.

186
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
It's nostalgic!

187
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
It's getting more stylish.

188
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Stylish?

189
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I don't think it'll fit there.

190
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Stylish!

191
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
It's here!

192
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Alright, let's go!

193
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Don't make fun of me!

194
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Alright, let's go!

195
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I can't run away anymore.

196
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I can't run away anymore.

197
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I caught it.

198
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I can't run away anymore.

199
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I can't run away anymore.

200
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
He did it!

201
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
He ran away again.

202
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
That's amazing.

203
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I can't run away anymore.

204
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
And Yamazaki's one-on-one battle.

205
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I can't run away anymore.

206
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
The one-on-one battle.

207
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
The one-on-one battle.

208
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
This is in line with the story, but it's not funny.

209
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Come on, come on.

210
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Let's go without him.

211
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Let's go without him.

212
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Come on!

213
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Come on!

214
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Come on!

215
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I can't run away anymore!

216
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I can't run away anymore!

217
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Let's go!

218
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Yamazaki Hosei is in Ginza.

219
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
He's in a Benha outfit.

220
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
He's laughing at the strategy.

221
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Let's take a look.
