1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Kirara!

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
What, Urara?

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Today is the final match!

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
That's right!

5
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Do your best!

6
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Let's do our best, Urara!

7
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
We've come this far.

8
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
That's right.

9
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
This year was especially tough.

10
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
That's right.

11
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
It was a tough fight.

12
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
The first match was really tough.

13
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
That's right.

14
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
We lost to that attack.

15
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
It was meaningless, but we stepped on the tap.

16
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
That's right.

17
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Today is the final match.

18
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
That's right.

19
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
We can't lose to them!

20
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Who are your opponents today?

21
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Today...

22
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Ucchanko Nanchanko!

23
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
They're the ones with the worst skin!

24
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
We can't lose to them!

25
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Do your best!

26
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I understand.

27
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Your face is a little scary.

28
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Are you okay?

29
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
But they're pitiful, too.

30
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
That's right.

31
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
They can't beat us.

32
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
That's right.

33
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Your serve is the best in this country!

34
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
That's right.

35
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
It's a serve from over there!

36
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
It's coming!

37
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Now is the time to finish it!

38
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
We did it!

39
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
We finished it!

40
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Next is the serve from over there.

41
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Don't give up!

42
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
It's our serve!

43
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
It's our serve!

44
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
It's my serve!

45
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
That's right.

46
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I haven't done anything like this before.

47
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Do your best!

48
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Take it well!

49
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm going!

50
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
What are you doing?

51
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Your serve is the worst!

52
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Take it well!

53
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I'm going!

54
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
What are you doing?

55
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Next is my serve.

56
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
That's right.

57
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Do your best!

58
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I got it.

59
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I'm going!

60
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
How could this happen?

61
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Kirara.

62
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
What?

63
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
At this rate, we might lose.

64
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Urara!

65
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
What are you saying?

66
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
It's okay.

67
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
We have to use that.

68
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
That?

69
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Are you talking about that?

70
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
If we use that, they might die.

71
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
It's okay if they die.

72
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
No!

73
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
We're going to win!

74
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
We're going to do it!

75
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
If you say we're going to do it...

76
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
We're going to combine!

77
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I got it.

78
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
If you think you can do it, do it!

79
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
It's the reception from the washroom.

80
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
It's not like that!

81
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I told you it's not like that!

82
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
In the middle of the night, the boy's serve started quietly.

83
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Actually, this program was the reason for the title.

84
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Hello, everyone!

85
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Hello!

86
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
That's right.

87
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
No matter how many times you say it, it's a popular number.

88
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
That's right.

89
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
It's finally here in Tokyo City.

90
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Yes, it's here.

91
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
It's downtown!

92
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
That's right...

93
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
It's here.

94
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I was feeling good from the very last conversation!

95
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I amHanamame!

96
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Hanamame?

97
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
No...

98
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I think you've kissed before.

99
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
What did it taste like?

100
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Please tell your father.

101
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Hey!

102
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
It's a long time ago, so I forgot.

103
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
No, no, no.

104
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I'm sorry.

105
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
It's okay.

106
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
It's okay.

107
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
From this one word,

108
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I was born in the era of the child's servant Arahen.

109
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Time is the time of the great Edo Pacific.

110
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
The world is playing with the name of the 800 wild birds.

111
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Where this man goes,

112
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
a storm will blow again today.

113
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I'm scared.

114
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Help me!

115
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Help me!

116
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Help me!

117
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Help me!

118
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Shit!

119
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
What the hell is this?

120
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
What the hell is this?

121
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
What the hell is this?

122
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Help me!

123
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Throw it!

124
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Throw it!

125
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
What the hell is this?

126
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I'm waiting for you.

127
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
What the hell is this?

128
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Shobai! Shobai!

129
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Let's think together.

130
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
On the popular program in January, Shobai! Shobai!

131
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Next, from downtown, from the era of the child's servant Arahen, two people from downtown.

132
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I'll ask the two of you.

133
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Everyone who appeared today,

134
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
the whole program is a golden hour program at night.

135
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
By the way, only this downtown program,

136
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
is a midnight Kanto local program.

137
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
There is no one who does PR here.

138
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Really.

139
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I'll talk to you later, Itsumi.

140
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
What are you making?

141
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
This is it.

142
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
20 seconds.

143
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
17 seconds left.

144
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I know how to explain it.

145
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I can't stop it.

146
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Hurry up and run.

147
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
It's a local program.

148
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Do your best.

149
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Don't come after me, Itsumi.

150
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Downtown special.

151
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
It's a manly program.

152
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
It's hard.

153
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Trendy golf competition.

154
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
The players of the Motten team are

155
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Ishida Junichi.

156
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Thank you.

157
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Kanna Masaki.

158
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Number 3, 160 yards, short hole in Ikegoye.

159
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Why are you shooting from the edge?

160
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
If you shoot from this side,

161
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
the tree will come out.

162
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Oh, I see.

163
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
You're making a mistake.

164
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
You're big.

165
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
It's bad.

166
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I forgot to put putter on bread in the morning.

167
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
It's Ishida's barbie putter.

168
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
It's a strong shot.

169
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
It's a good shot.

170
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
It's on the line.

171
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Oh, nice.

172
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

173
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Big.

174
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I don't have anything to teach Junichi.

175
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I didn't say anything.

176
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Kanna, you're out.

177
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
The number 3 is here.

178
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:28,000
The number 3 is here.

179
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
The number 3 is here.

180
00:08:36,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Ready, start.

181
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
It's still going.

182
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
It's still going.

183
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
It's still going.

184
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
It's still going.

185
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
It's still going.

186
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
It's still going.

187
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
The match between the two teams.

188
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
The penalty game is a tie.

189
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:33,000
The penalty game is a tie.

190
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Yoshimura is fast.

191
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Yoshimura is fast.

192
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
It's a tie.

193
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:55,000
The penalty game is won by Mr. Watarabe.

194
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I'll let you go to your next job as you are now.

195
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
My next job will be a target special.

196
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Hey, stop it.

197
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Damn it, I'll go first.

198
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
The target special is the 20th anniversary special.

199
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
It's a big deal.

200
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
What are you doing?

201
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I'm watching TV right now.

202
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Next is Masayuki Watanabe.

203
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Stop it.

204
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I'm sorry to leave you alone during the live broadcast.

205
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
There was a group called Downtown.

206
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
What are you doing?

207
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I lost the game and went to my next job.

208
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I was joking.

209
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I'm sorry to leave you alone during the live broadcast.

210
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I'm waiting for a return of a hot guy.

211
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I don't know such a guy.

212
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I'm waiting for a return of a hot guy.

213
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Good evening.

214
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
The temperature in Tokyo is 23 degrees.

215
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
The wind is cool, isn't it?

216
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
It's getting warmer.

217
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
It's getting warmer.

218
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
It's getting warmer.

219
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
It's getting warmer.

220
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
It's getting warmer.

221
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
It's getting warmer.

222
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
It's getting warmer.

223
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
It's getting warmer.

224
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I can't do it.

225
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I can't do this.

226
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I'm bleeding.

227
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I'm sorry to say this, but I don't hate it, but...

228
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
You say it over and over again.

229
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I don't hate it. I don't hate it.

230
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I don't hate it.

231
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I don't hate it.

232
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
It's been 25 years since I debuted this year.

233
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I don't hate it at all.

234
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Park Win's skiing match!

235
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Alps' long-sleeved shirt!

236
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
It's almost time.

237
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Yeah!

238
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
If Yoshizumi-san loses,

239
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
you'll have to play a penalty game.

240
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I won, so I'm going to take over this place.

241
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I don't know what you're looking at.

242
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Start!

243
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
No, no, no, no!

244
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:54,000
My foot is still open!

245
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I don't want to lose!

246
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I'm going to score a goal!

247
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Are you stupid?

248
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Here we go!

249
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I'm going down!

250
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:26,000
No, no, no, no!

251
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Penalty game!

252
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Penalty game!

253
00:14:45,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Penalty game!

254
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Captain!

255
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I'm so happy!

256
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I'm the happiest when I'm with the captain!

257
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
The first kid's skier!

258
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Chiki-chiki!

259
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Ogiri Takahashi!

260
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Hanashika-san and the others, come on out!

261
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Ayu-yo! Osakabe!

262
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
First, Japanese television.

263
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
This is called work.

264
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
It's the best!

265
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Let's go with work.

266
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
The best, the best company!

267
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
C!

268
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I don't know anything about UFOs or ghost shows.

269
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
S!

270
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I'm a good producer, but...

271
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Don't say that!

272
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
C!

273
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I have a lot of sex-loving employees.

274
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
C!

275
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
S!

276
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I'm a good producer, but...

277
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Don't say that!

278
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Hanachan!

279
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Let's go with work.

280
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
C!

281
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I have a lot of sex-loving employees.

282
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
C!

283
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I have a tight wife.

284
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
C!

285
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
My lips are drooping...

286
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Don't say that!

287
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
K!

288
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
The more I open my pores...

289
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I'll decide how to do it.

290
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Don't say that!

291
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Chikichiki!

292
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Seat-tripping war!

293
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Ah-chi-chi!

294
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
As you can see, we're going to roller skate today.

295
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
My butt is in the way.

296
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
If we get caught, we lose.

297
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
That's why people from both teams go to grab each other's butt.

298
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I see.

299
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
It's not a new project or anything.

300
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
C!

301
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Hamada!

302
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Can you take my attack?

303
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Who is it?

304
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Who is it?

305
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Who is it?

306
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
There he is!

307
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Hurry up!

308
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Push him!

309
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Push him!

310
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
If you push him, he'll fall!

311
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Push him!

312
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Ah-chi-chi!

313
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Ah-chi-chi!

314
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Ah-chi-chi!

315
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Ah-chi-chi!

316
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Ah-chi-chi!

317
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Chikichiki!

318
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Coordination strategy!

319
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Okay!

320
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Let's go.

321
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Coordination strategy.

322
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
We'll choose each other's clothes.

323
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Let's choose.

324
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
And then we'll do the fashion show.

325
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
That's right.

326
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
That's right.

327
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
This is tough.

328
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Even adults can do this, right?

329
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
No, no.

330
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Why?

331
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
You can do this.

332
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I'm a kid.

333
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
What is this?

334
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
What is this?

335
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
A hip pad.

336
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
A hip pad?

337
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
To improve your style.

338
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I'll definitely buy this.

339
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Here comes the fashionable Hama-chan.

340
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Hama-chan, come on out!

341
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
The theme is one shot.

342
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
One shot.

343
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
One shot. Mom's help.

344
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
This pants.

345
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I was curious about this.

346
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
This is for 2 years old.

347
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Let me tell you something.

348
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
What is it?

349
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I'm an 8 month old kid.

350
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
My theme is, what kind of person are you?

351
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Now, please come out.

352
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:55,000
What is this?

353
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
This is for you.

354
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Happy new year.

355
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Idiot.

356
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Let's go!

357
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Are you Souchanka Granbury part 1?

358
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Who is the person who looks like a big poop?

359
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Who is the person who won the grand prize?

360
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Now, please think about it.

361
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Rimei Onishi.

362
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Matsumoto Iyo.

363
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Matsumoto Iyo-san.

364
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Matsumoto Iyo-san.

365
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Matsumoto Iyo-san.

366
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Iro-chan.

367
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Who won the grand prize?

368
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Matsumoto Iyo-san.

369
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,000
This is the first time Matsumoto Iyo-san has been revealed.

370
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
He is Matsumoto Iyo-san's older brother.

371
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
He revealed the story of his younger brother's childhood.

372
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
He was looking forward to the rain.

373
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:27,000
When it started to rain, he didn't put on his shoes.

374
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
He went to the sky and said,

375
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
You idiot! Come down!

376
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Come down!

377
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I saw something.

378
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:49,000
And a big guest appeared.

379
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
First question.

380
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,000
What was your middle school name?

381
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
This is...

382
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
A man who buys with his face.

383
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
I thought it was me.

384
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
What is your name?

385
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
A country panda.

386
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
What is your middle school name?

387
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I don't know.

388
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Kawaii-san.

389
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Idiot.

390
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Pig glasses.

391
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
I hate you.

392
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,000
What are you doing?

393
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
What are you doing?

394
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
What are you doing?

395
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
What are you doing?

396
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
What are you doing?

397
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
What are you doing?

398
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,000
And Matsumoto Iyo-san's mother appeared.

399
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
He is the third child.

400
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:01,000
I'm sorry to say this, but...

401
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
He is like a pet.

402
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
How was New York?

403
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
New York?

404
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Did you have fun?

405
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:16,000
I couldn't stand the long flight.

406
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
When I was walking in the city,

407
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
I saw a black man.

408
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I was very scared.

409
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
It wasn't my mother, but...

410
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
We were walking in New York.

411
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
The camera was rolling.

412
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
He looked very scary.

413
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
He looked like he was eating two and a half.

414
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
When I was lying down,

415
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
he pushed me.

416
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,000
I was about to hit the two and a half.

417
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:55,000
I was about to hit the two and a half.

418
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
What are you doing?

419
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
When I looked back,

420
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:07,000
he looked like he was going to hit me again.

421
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
That was really scary.

422
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,000
I had a good street fight with a black man.

423
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
I thought it was okay to fight.

424
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
It was okay.

425
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
I wasn't scared at all.

426
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
I wasn't running away.

427
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,000
I was luring him.

428
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
He was obviously running away.

429
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
I was luring him.

430
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
I thought he was coming this way.

431
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:37,000
There was a trap here.

432
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
If you sprinkle salt on a slug,

433
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
the body will melt.

434
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
But if you keep sprinkling salt,

435
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
what will happen in the end?

436
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
It will disappear.

437
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
It will disappear?

438
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
It will disappear.

439
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
I see.

440
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
But the salt will remain, right?

441
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
The salt will remain.

442
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
I see.

443
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
That's not the case.

444
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Oh!

445
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
This was an experiment.

446
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Of course.

447
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
First, I looked for a slug.

448
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
I knew that if I sprinkled salt on a slug,

449
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
it would melt.

450
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
I see.

451
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
So I sprinkled salt on the slug.

452
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
It started to melt a little.

453
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
I see.

454
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
I sprinkled more salt.

455
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
It started to melt even more.

456
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
I see.

457
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
What will happen in the end?

458
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
I brought more and more salt from here.

459
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
More and more salt.

460
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
I sprinkled more salt.

461
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
What happened?

462
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
I told my mother to get angry.

463
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
I want to cut this part.

464
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Thank you very much.
