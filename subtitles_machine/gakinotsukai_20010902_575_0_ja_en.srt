00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Hello!

2
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:14,980
S Один crush

3
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:16,840
Introducing my

4
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:19,220
pert longing

5
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:20,940
not full into the stomach

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,940
banyak

7
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:24,940
I'll be back soon.

8
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:28,940
You've been off for 9 days, right?

9
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:29,940
Yes, that's right.

10
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:32,940
You look so tired.

11
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:33,940
Because I haven't worked?

12
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:36,940
Because you haven't worked, it's strange to be here.

13
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:38,940
You should hold it in.

14
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:39,940
Why?

15
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:41,940
It's shiny.

16
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:43,940
That's not true.

17
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:45,940
The monitor doesn't look like that.

18
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:47,940
The TV screen is shiny.

19
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:48,940
I don't care about the TV screen.

20
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:50,940
The TV is the main thing.

21
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:51,940
You're lying!

22
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:53,940
No, no, even on TV, your face is shining!

23
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:55,940
It's okay, it's like this, it's like this.

24
00:00:55,940 --> 00:01:00,940
It's not because everyone is laughing, it's because you're shining!

25
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:03,940
Well, well, well, I guess I'll have to go and release it.

26
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:05,940
Release?

27
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:11,940
This program is brought to you by the following sponsors.

28
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:13,940
We just took a break, didn't we?

29
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:14,940
Oh, really?

30
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:18,940
We went to Okinawa last time, and then in the second half we went to Hachijojima.

31
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:20,940
Why are you always talking about the island?

32
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:22,940
No, no, it's just funny.

33
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:24,940
You've never heard of Hachijoji, right?

34
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:26,940
There's nothing there.

35
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:28,940
There's no convenience store.

36
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:30,940
But that's in Tokyo.

37
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:32,940
And there are people?

38
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:35,940
There are people, well, a little bit.

39
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:38,940
From that little bit...

40
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:40,940
Come here for a moment.

41
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:44,940
Come to my room for a moment.

42
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:48,940
That's why I don't have a theme like that.

43
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:51,940
I'm just playing with my thoughts.

44
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:53,940
I'm sorry.

45
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:54,940
You changed your mind.

46
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:55,940
I changed my mind.

47
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:56,940
Okinawa and...

48
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:58,940
Okinawa!

49
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:00,940
You bastard!

50
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:03,940
I have only family.

51
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:05,940
I have family but...

52
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:06,940
No, no, no.

53
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:07,940
You have family.

54
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:08,940
No, not Okinawa.

55
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:12,940
I'm not.

56
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:13,940
I'm not.

57
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:16,940
There are a lot of people who travel.

58
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:18,940
Well, I've seen a few of them.

59
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:24,940
You're doing it!

60
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:25,940
Stop it.

61
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:27,940
You're making me even more excited.

62
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:30,940
You're doing it!

63
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:33,940
I don't want to talk about that!

64
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:37,940
I want to talk about what happened in Okinawa.

65
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:38,940
I don't care about the women.

66
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:39,940
No, that's not it.

67
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:42,940
Basically, that's what I want to hear.

68
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:44,940
What happened?

69
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:46,940
I was a bit surprised.

70
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:50,940
What happened?

71
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:53,940
I was driving in Okinawa at night.

72
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:56,940
I was on the road.

73
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:59,940
There was no street lights.

74
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:02,940
I was jumping around.

75
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:05,940
I was jumping around in the distance.

76
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:08,940
I was driving by.

77
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:12,940
There are cats fighting.

78
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:13,940
Hmm.

79
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:19,940
But in Japan, in Tokyo and Osaka, you can see it, right?

80
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:21,940
And they go like,

81
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:23,940
Fuuu! Fuuu!

82
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:25,940
Fuuu! Fuuu!

83
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:28,940
When it comes to Okinawa,

84
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:34,940
I think it's probably the blood of the Iriomote.

85
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:37,940
Cats aren't ordinary cats.

86
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:40,940
This tree is rough.

87
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:42,940
And these two are...

88
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:44,940
Koemasa-san and...

89
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:49,940
You know?

90
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:51,940
These two are Koemasa-san and...

91
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,940
Kanse-tsutori-yaimutan.

92
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:55,940
They're doing it.

93
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:56,940
What is this?

94
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:59,940
This is scary.

95
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:01,940
Sometimes, we...

96
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:03,940
We're lit up with lights.

97
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:05,940
I sometimes see them while I'm in the room.

98
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:09,940
That's amazing!

99
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:10,940
So everyone says,

100
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:11,940
the cat is cute, it's cute.

101
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:13,940
That's a lie.

102
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:14,940
Well, I've never seen that kind of place.

103
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:16,940
After all, in front of humans,

104
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:18,940
they go like this,

105
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:20,940
like this, like this.

106
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:21,940
But,

107
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:23,940
in places where people don't see,

108
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:25,940
the cat fight in such a dark place

109
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:28,940
was really scary!

110
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:29,940
You've been watching it all the time?

111
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:30,940
I've been watching it all the time.

112
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:36,940
And then he stood up and bit my ear.

113
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:39,940
He bit my ear and it was like this.

114
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:42,940
And then my ear was ripped off.

115
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:43,940
It was scary.

116
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:46,940
And the one who got ripped off was like this.

117
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:49,940
And the one who bit my ear was like this.

118
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:55,940
What? Is it over?

119
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:57,940
It was a scary thing.

120
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:01,940
I saw something scary.

121
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:02,940
That was amazing.

122
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:03,940
It was amazing.

123
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:06,940
At first I thought he was a masked wrestler.

124
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:07,940
Which one?

125
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:08,940
Both.

126
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:10,940
Oh, both.

127
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:11,940
I see.

128
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:14,940
I wanted to show that.

129
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:15,940
I wanted to show that.

130
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,940
Well, if you see it, you'll see it.

131
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:18,940
It was amazing.

132
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:21,940
At the end, it was like a fight between masked wrestlers.

133
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:23,940
I had my hands in the mask.

134
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:25,940
But...

135
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:27,940
I was out of the center of my eyes.

136
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:29,940
No, you weren't.

137
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:31,940
I could see my nose from there.

138
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:33,940
No, you weren't.

139
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:35,940
I wasn't wearing a mask.

140
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:37,940
I wasn't out of the center of my eyes.

141
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:39,940
There were a lot of things.

142
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:40,940
I was scared.

143
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:41,940
I see.

144
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:43,940
That idiot Yamashita.

145
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:45,940
I like him.

146
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:48,940
I say it a lot.

147
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:50,940
I'm taking him with me.

148
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:53,940
Do you know anyone who has a bad nose?

149
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:55,940
Like chikuno or bien.

150
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:56,940
Ah, I know.

151
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:03,940
Those people, when their blood pressure goes up, they do something amazing.

152
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:06,940
Their faces hurt.

153
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:11,940
When they go to Okinawa, they go into the landing position and go like this.

154
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:13,940
Their blood pressure goes up.

155
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:14,940
I see.

156
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:18,940
He was next to me, but I was thinking, ah, I'm going to get stuck.

157
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:20,940
So I did it from the side.

158
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:24,940
I did it like that.

159
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:27,940
I thought, maybe they broke up in Tokyo.

160
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:29,940
With someone?

161
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:31,940
With your lover?

162
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:33,940
Why now?

163
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:35,940
It's fine.

164
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:37,940
I was doing this all the time.

165
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:39,940
What is this guy?

166
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:40,940
I was like that.

167
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:42,940
What I did was, my face was completely pale.

168
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:44,940
My face was painful.

169
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:46,940
My face was painful.

170
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:50,940
What are you doing? It's hot in Okinawa, enjoy it.

171
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:54,940
I said, I'm going to Edo.

172
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:58,940
I was following him, but when I was preparing for the interview,

173
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:00,940
I couldn't get better.

174
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:02,940
I couldn't get better. My face hurts.

175
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:05,940
I don't understand the meaning of the word, my face hurts.

176
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:07,940
What is it? My face hurts.

177
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:09,940
My stomach hurts.

178
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:11,940
My stomach hurts.

179
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:15,940
He had surgery a long time ago, but he had a lot of poop.

180
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:17,940
You dirty bastard!

181
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:19,940
Your nose is smelly!

182
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,940
Well, it's a disease.

183
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:23,940
I don't understand the meaning of that.

184
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:25,940
Your nose is smelly as it is.

185
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:27,940
And then...

186
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:33,940
And then, I borrowed a car.

187
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:35,940
I got on the car.

188
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:37,940
What the hell?

189
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:41,940
I got on the car.

190
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:43,940
I was going like this.

191
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:45,940
I was feeling better.

192
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:50,940
I was feeling better, but then I hit Yamashita's head in the middle of the car.

193
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:52,940
And I started to have a bad feeling again.

194
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:54,940
I started to feel pain again.

195
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:56,940
I said, I'm going to the hospital.

196
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:58,940
I said, let's go eat somewhere.

197
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:00,940
I started to have a bad feeling again.

198
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:02,940
I said, let's eat something.

199
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,940
I said, I'll have udon.

200
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:06,940
I got better.

201
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:10,940
I took a sip of udon.

202
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:12,940
And the pressure of the air changes like this.

203
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:14,940
It's like this.

204
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:16,940
And it's like this.

205
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:19,940
Don't take me with you.

206
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:21,940
I'm so old.

207
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:24,940
I was like,

208
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:26,940
I was like,

209
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,940
I was like,

210
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:30,940
I was like,

211
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:32,940
I was like,

212
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:34,940
I was like,

213
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:36,940
I was like,

214
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:38,940
I was like,

215
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:40,940
I'm sorry.

216
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:43,940
I have bad hearing.

217
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,940
But it's not that bad.

218
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:51,940
What do you mean by bad hearing?

219
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:56,940
You know, when I did that, I said I couldn't hear.

220
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:58,940
Oh, number 9?

221
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:01,940
I couldn't hear, so my ears were...

222
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:03,940
...crashed, right?

223
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:07,940
The pressure on my ears made my ears go crazy, so my head went like this.

224
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:11,940
I don't want to say that my face hurts.

225
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:15,940
But if your face hurts, it's scary.

226
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:17,940
I'm scared of my face.

227
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:19,940
No matter how I think about it, it's strange.

228
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:21,940
What do you mean by your face hurts?

229
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:23,940
It hurts, it hurts, it hurts, it hurts, it hurts.

230
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:27,940
Even if you say that, nothing hurts.

231
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:32,940
Isn't your bone hot?

232
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:35,940
It's okay.

233
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:37,940
Really?

234
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:40,940
You're so cold.

235
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:46,940
Actually...

236
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:49,940
I always say this in my letters...

237
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:53,940
But there's someone who wants to talk to me.

238
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:54,940
I'll call him.

239
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:56,940
No, it's not that important.

240
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:58,940
Please come in.

241
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:00,940
Hello

242
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:17,940
Yamazaki Hosei-kun has a little something to say

243
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:19,940
This is amazing

244
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:27,940
If you appear again, I can fix it

245
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:29,940
No, no, it's okay, it's okay.

246
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:31,940
I've been a child servant since the second time.

247
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:33,940
Since the second time, you've been a child servant.

248
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:35,940
Yes, yes.

249
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:37,940
It's been 12 years.

250
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:39,940
Well, good job.

251
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:41,940
Ah, good job.

252
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:43,940
Good job!

253
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:45,940
That's impossible!

254
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:49,940
Well, I think so, but...

255
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:51,940
I'm getting married!

256
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:10,940
This is the first time I've seen this.

257
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:12,940
This is the first time.

258
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:16,940
This is a real story.

259
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:18,940
It's a serious story.

260
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:19,940
Who? Who?

261
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:20,940
Aya.

262
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:25,940
I don't know who that is.

263
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:26,940
Who? Who?

264
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:27,940
Aya.

265
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:29,940
Aya? Who?

266
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:32,940
So, it's not like you're a comedian.

267
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:34,940
That's not what I meant.

268
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:36,940
I'm just a normal person.

269
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:37,940
A normal person?

270
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:38,940
Yes.

271
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:39,940
A photo?

272
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:40,940
Oh, wow.

273
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:42,940
The other person?

274
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:56,940
Who? Who?

275
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:58,940
I said it wasn't anyone!

276
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:00,940
Ayayaya!

277
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:02,940
What are you talking about?

278
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:05,940
I've met him many times.

279
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:06,940
Oh, really?

280
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:07,940
Yes.

281
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:09,940
We've known each other for a long time.

282
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:10,940
Yes, that's right.

283
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:11,940
3 years.

284
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:12,940
3 years, yes.

285
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:13,940
It was long.

286
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:14,940
Yes, yes, yes.

287
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:15,940
It was a long time.

288
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:17,940
She was a little girl with small eyes.

289
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:24,940
Well, that's it.

290
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:25,940
Yes, yes, yes.

291
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:26,940
This is...

292
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:27,940
It's amazing.

293
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:28,940
Congratulations.

294
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:30,940
I have a lot of questions about marriage.

295
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:31,940
Please answer them.

296
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:32,940
I will ask you some questions.

297
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:33,940
Yes.

298
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:34,940
Yes, thank you.

299
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:35,940
First of all,

300
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:37,940
You can be a wife.

301
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:39,940
What is your wife's first impression?

302
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:43,940
Well, I don't really have to say that.

303
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:47,940
I think she doesn't like the relationship.

304
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:49,940
She's your senior.

305
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:51,940
She wants to know that.

306
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:53,940
She's used to it.

307
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,940
She might have asked you.

308
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:57,940
What?

309
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:58,940
What?

310
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:00,940
What is your first impression?

311
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:02,940
That's important.

312
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:04,940
First impression.

313
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:07,940
I thought she was cute!

314
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:10,940
Where did you meet her?

315
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:12,940
In Roppongi

316
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:13,940
In Roppongi?

317
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:16,940
I went to eat with Matsumoto-san

318
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:19,940
I went to eat with Matsumoto-san 3 years ago

319
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:22,940
Matsumoto-san and I went to the car

320
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:25,940
And then when I went

321
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:27,940
You went to eat with Matsumoto-san?

322
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:29,940
Matsumoto-san went home right?

323
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:31,940
Matsumoto-san went to the restaurant

324
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:36,940
I said, and then I pointed at her face, and she said, ah, it's Machan.

325
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:37,940
Eh, really?

326
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:38,940
That's right.

327
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:39,940
I've never heard of that before.

328
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:43,940
And then I went down and said, what's wrong?

329
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:44,940
Eh?

330
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:45,940
What's wrong?

331
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:46,940
What's wrong?

332
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:47,940
What did you say to who?

333
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:49,940
No, to that Aya.

334
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:50,940
Where is Aya?

335
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:52,940
Aya is outside.

336
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:53,940
Eh?

337
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:55,940
Aya is a fool?

338
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:57,940
A fool!

339
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:00,940
I can't believe it!

340
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,940
Why were you outside?

341
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:04,940
Were you just walking outside?

342
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:05,940
I was just walking outside.

343
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:06,940
Just walking?

344
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:07,940
Just walking.

345
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:08,940
With who?

346
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:10,940
With Aya and Aya's friends.

347
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:12,940
I was just walking.

348
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:13,940
And then the car came.

349
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:14,940
Mr. Matsumoto's car came.

350
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:15,940
And he said,

351
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:17,940
Ah, it's Machan!

352
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,940
After that, I went to the car.

353
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:20,940
And I said,

354
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:22,940
Ah, it's Machan!

355
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:24,940
And I looked up.

356
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:25,940
And he said,

357
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:26,940
Ah, it's Yama-chan!

358
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:28,940
Then, you get off the plane and ask,

359
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:29,940
What's wrong?

360
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:31,940
Ah, so that's where you connect to the plane.

361
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:33,940
That's a really long story.

362
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:35,940
You get it, right?

363
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:38,940
I don't know what to do.

364
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:40,940
Then you shake hands with the person.

365
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:41,940
And then, well,

366
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:44,940
The person on the phone tells you.

367
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:45,940
You're fast.

368
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:48,940
You're fast.

369
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:51,940
And then, that's the first step.

370
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:52,940
Get used to it.

371
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:54,940
Get used to it.

372
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:55,940
So you're saying you're going out with her?

373
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:56,940
Yes, we're going out.

374
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:57,940
I see.

375
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:02,940
So, what kind of play did you two have when you first dated her?

376
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:05,940
We went to Ebisu and we were with Hoto-chan.

377
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:06,940
With Hoto-chan?

378
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:07,940
Yes.

379
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:11,940
Me, Hoto-chan, Aya, and Aya's friends.

380
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:14,940
Ah, so you were just friends with no future.

381
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:19,940
So you were like, what are you going to do about it?

382
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:20,940
No, no, no.

383
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:21,940
There's still more.

384
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:23,940
There's still more?

385
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:24,940
You still have a girlfriend?

386
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:27,940
I don't think everyone is interested in that.

387
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:28,940
I can understand that.

388
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:31,940
It's like, I don't care anymore.

389
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:35,940
Tell us your favorite part of your girlfriend, Aya.

390
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:41,940
I'm called a futan.

391
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:45,940
You're being called gross.

392
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:48,940
Why is it called futan in Hosei Yamagaki?

393
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:50,940
You know, that's because...

394
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:51,940
What is it?

395
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:53,940
I used to live in Ikoda.

396
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:55,940
I used to live in Ikoda.

397
00:15:55,940 --> 00:16:03,940
When she came, she was climbing the stairs like this.

398
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:05,940
I'm sorry.

399
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:09,940
Honestly, I've never seen such a gross press conference.

400
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:11,940
Press conference?

401
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:13,940
No one is coming.

402
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:15,940
No one is coming.

403
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:17,940
No one is coming.

404
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:19,940
I think everyone is coming.

405
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:21,940
I thought you were really angry.

406
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:23,940
There was no staff.

407
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:25,940
It was the first time I announced it.

408
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:27,940
I was saying, Fuccha, Fuccha.

409
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:29,940
Fuccha, Fuccha, Fuccha, Fuccha.

410
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:31,940
I was saying that.

411
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:37,940
Before I knew it, she called me Fuccha.

412
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:39,940
She answered the question.

413
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:41,940
That's right.

414
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:43,940
She is a cute girl who can say such things.

415
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:44,940
I see.

416
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:45,940
Pure.

417
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:46,940
Yes.

418
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:47,940
Wait a minute.

419
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,940
I don't have the energy to ask.

420
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:50,940
You do!

421
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:52,940
I don't know! I can't read the atmosphere!

422
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:54,940
You're asking so much here!

423
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:55,940
I can read the atmosphere!

424
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:56,940
It's okay.

425
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:57,940
It's okay?

426
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:59,940
Then, let's stop asking these questions.

427
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:01,940
It's okay, right?

428
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:03,940
Which one do you want, Daki-san?

429
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:05,940
There's a lot.

430
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:06,940
Which one do you want to answer?

431
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:07,940
Ah, the wedding ring.

432
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:08,940
Did you give it to her?

433
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:10,940
I haven't given it to her yet.

434
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:11,940
Oh, really?

435
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:12,940
I haven't even given her a seat yet.

436
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:15,940
Are you okay with this?

437
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:17,940
No, I mean, I'm not interested in you two anymore.

438
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:18,940
What?

439
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:19,940
Wait a minute.

440
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:21,940
If you open the door, I'll go.

441
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:22,940
Did you propose to her?

442
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:23,940
No, I didn't.

443
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:24,940
What?

444
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:25,940
What?

445
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:27,940
You're just saying it.

446
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:28,940
Why?

447
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:29,940
I'm surprised.

448
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:30,940
You should have proposed to her.

449
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:32,940
No, no, wait a minute.

450
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:33,940
Yes?

451
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:34,940
Really?

452
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:35,940
Yes?

453
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:37,940
Is she really your girlfriend?

454
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:39,940
Stop it.

455
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:42,940
Are you making fun of me?

456
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:45,940
I'm doing the same thing as you.

457
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:54,940
You saw it, right?

458
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:56,940
You saw it, right?

459
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:57,940
You saw it, right?

460
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:59,940
You said, you didn't see it.

461
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:01,940
I'm telling the truth.

462
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:05,940
But shouldn't you propose?

463
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:10,940
I proposed to her and we dated for about a week.

464
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:12,940
That's fast!

465
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:15,940
You said you wanted to get married, but you didn't!

466
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:21,940
I asked her about the timing of the marriage, and she said it was all about timing.

467
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:26,940
So after a week, I proposed to her, but she said no.

468
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:29,940
She rejected you.

469
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:31,940
She said no once.

470
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:32,940
You thought about it well.

471
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:35,940
I thought you could get married in a week.

472
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:36,940
You didn't say no, did you?

473
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:38,940
I said no.

474
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:40,940
I'm sure of it.

475
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:43,940
But, I don't think you don't want to.

476
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:46,940
We haven't been together for long, so I can't think of anything.

477
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:47,940
Is that how you see it?

478
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:49,940
No, I don't want to.

479
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:50,940
Excuse me?

480
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:52,940
It's been two years.

481
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:54,940
It's been two years and three years.

482
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:55,940
Three years.

483
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:56,940
Yes.

484
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:57,940
So you don't want to propose again?

485
00:18:57,940 --> 00:18:59,940
No, I don't propose.

486
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:00,940
I really don't propose.

487
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:01,940
You should have proposed.

488
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:03,940
But I can't do it anymore.

489
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:04,940
It's embarrassing.

490
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:05,940
You should ask Hamada about that.

491
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:06,940
How to propose.

492
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:08,940
Oh, Senpai!

493
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:10,940
Senpai's proposal...

494
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:21,940
What is it?

495
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:27,940
Do you propose with that face?

496
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:31,940
I think it's fine if you propose properly.

497
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:35,940
But honestly, you've been proposing for 3 years, right?

498
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:37,940
I don't propose to her.

499
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:39,940
I don't have anything.

500
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:41,940
So you have a purpose?

501
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:43,940
I understand.

502
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:45,940
You are talking here.

503
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:47,940
I think it's strange.

504
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:49,940
I didn't hear it.

505
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:51,940
Are you doing it on your own?

506
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:55,940
I'm going to talk about this when I get home.

507
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:57,940
I said on TV.

508
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:59,940
I'm going home now.

509
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:01,940
I don't know if I'll come back.

510
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:03,940
Don't be surprised.

511
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:04,940
I see.

512
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:05,940
It's strange.

513
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:06,940
So...

514
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:11,940
I don't understand.

515
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:13,940
It's strange.

516
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:14,940
I see.

517
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:15,940
It's strange.

518
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:16,940
I see.

519
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:17,940
Okay, I got it.

520
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:18,940
Right?

521
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:22,940
There are many things I want to congratulate you.

522
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:24,940
What do you mean?

523
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:25,940
What do you mean?

524
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:27,940
I did it.

525
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:37,940
If you don't say that, you can't propose or get a girlfriend.

526
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:39,940
I did it.

527
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:50,940
I'm surprised. Yamazaki is your father.

528
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:52,940
No, I'm his father.

529
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:54,940
What are you going to do?

530
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:55,940
Seriously?

531
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:56,940
You're a friend!

532
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:01,940
I don't like this!

533
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:11,940
So, since the second time, the one who appeared before, Yama-chan, has become like this.

534
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:13,940
So, from our program's producer.

535
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:15,880
And then...

536
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:18,100
From...Chief Séb squeeze...

537
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:18,780
Meaning?

538
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:18,560
S-Sordon knit

539
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:33,380
See?

540
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:34,940
It's just...

541
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:16,360
destroyed and

542
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:36,460
wrong

543
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:38,380
There's a lot of flowers

544
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:37,280
My

545
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:41,380
Russia

546
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:46,380
I can tell from your appearance, but you are a single-minded person.

547
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:49,380
You are one rank higher than me.

548
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:51,380
I can tell that you are giving me a hard time.

549
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:54,380
What should I do? Should I open it?

550
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:55,380
Open it.

551
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:56,380
Yes.

552
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:57,380
I'll open it.

553
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:02,380
I'm scared.

554
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:03,380
Which way should I look?

555
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:04,380
Which way?

556
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:05,380
No, no, look up.

557
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:07,380
I'm scared.

558
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:11,380
Ready, go!

559
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:12,380
Hup!

560
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:19,380
That was too scary.

561
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:20,380
Eiko-san!

562
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:21,380
I'm scared!

563
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:22,380
It's okay.

564
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:23,380
It's like, boom, boom, boom.

565
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:24,380
In order.

566
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:25,380
In order.

567
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:26,380
In order.

568
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:27,380
Boom, boom, boom.

569
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:28,380

Cheers!

574
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,500
Heipo is amazing. He just gave him a shampoo.

575
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:04,500
Let's drink to the world's Heipo's temperature.

576
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,500
Congratulations, Yama-chan.

577
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:13,500
From now on, I'm not alone.

578
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,500
With my wife and...

579
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,500
...with my children...

580
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:23,500
Together, I'll live a wonderful life as an entertainer.

581
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,500
I'll live a life of perfection.

582
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:29,500
What?

583
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:33,500
I'll live a wonderful life as an entertainer.

584
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:35,500
I pray that you will be convinced.

585
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:42,500
Well, it's fine. Let's all be convinced together later.

586
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:44,500
I prayed for that.

587
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:47,500
Let's toast to Yama-chan's good fortune!

588
