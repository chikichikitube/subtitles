1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
After this, I'm not going to play Gaki no Tsukai anymore.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
I'm not going to play Gaki no Tsukai for the first time!

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
100 Yen Crane Battle Royale!

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I'm not going to catch a cold today.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Today, I'm going to play a game.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
When you go to the game center, you can get 100 or 200 Yen.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
You can pull up a stuffed toy and bring it to your place.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I'm going to play that game as a human being.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm going to introduce you to a great person.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
She's the queen of SM Entertainment, Yukari Jo!

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
How long have you been doing this?

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
It's been six years.

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Just by looking at her face, you can tell she's an M.

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I can tell.

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
By the way, I'm from downtown. I have a partner, Matsumoto Hitoshi.

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Who is he?

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
He's an M.

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
He's an M?

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Downtown Matsumoto is an M?

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Are you sure?

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm sure.

22
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
He's sticking out his shoulder.

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Matsumoto is sticking out his shoulder?

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I see.

25
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Today, I'm going to play Crane.

26
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Crane!

27
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm going to play Crane as a human being.

28
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Please welcome these two!

29
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Hello!

30
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Nice to meet you!

31
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
What the hell are you doing?

32
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Please keep playing Crane.

33
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm sorry.

34
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
What?

35
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Yamazaki and Noriyasu.

36
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Today, they are...

37
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
They are going to play Crane.

38
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
But!

39
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
There are many obstacles waiting for them.

40
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Please clear them while playing Crane.

41
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Okay.

42
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Let's get started!

43
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I'm from Ukarujo.

44
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Who are you?

45
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
What?

46
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'm from Ukarujo. I'm here to play Crane.

47
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Are you going to play Crane?

48
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
No, I can't.

49
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Please.

50
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Come on.

51
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Don't make me do my best!

52
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Don't be afraid of me!

53
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Ouch!

54
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Ouch!

55
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Ouch!

56
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Ouch!

57
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Ouch!

58
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I don't know how to play Crane.

59
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I'll do my best.

60
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Hey!

61
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Raise your hand!

62
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Raise your hand!

63
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Raise your hand!

64
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Help me!

65
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Hey!

66
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Help me!

67
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Hey!

68
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Help me!

69
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
What?

70
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Do your best!

71
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
If you don't go to the surface, I can't catch you.

72
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I'm here to play Crane.

73
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Crane.

74
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I'm scared of you.

75
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Hey!

76
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
What are you waiting for?

77
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
It's Crane Army!

78
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Crane!

79
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Crane!

80
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Crane!

81
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Crane!

82
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Crane!

83
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Crane!

84
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Crane!

85
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Crane!

86
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Crane!

87
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Crane!

88
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Crane!

89
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I'm being shot!

90
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I'm being shot!

91
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I'm being shot!

92
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Crane Army is too many!

93
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I'm also frightened now.

94
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Turn on the sound of the water.

95
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Drop the water.

96
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Don't take the doll.

97
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
No.

98
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Don't take the doll.

99
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Don't take the doll.

100
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Don't take the doll.

101
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Watch out.

102
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Watch out.

103
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
No.

104
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Don't take the doll.

105
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Don't take the doll.

106
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
No.

107
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Yonaguni.

108
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Good job.

109
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Good.

110
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Why?

111
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Watch out.

112
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Watch out.

113
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Watch out.

114
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Watch out.

115
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Don't take the doll.

116
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Don't take the doll.

117
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Ladies and gentlemen.

118
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Good, good, good.

119
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
By the way.

120
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
You do your best.

121
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
What?

122
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
You shouldn't take a break.

123
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Why?

124
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
It's hard.

125
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I want to take a break today.

126
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
You have to get up early today.

127
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
You.

128
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
You don't say that every week.

129
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
You don't say that every week.

130
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I can't get up today.

131
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I can't.

132
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I've been alone for two days.

133
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Why?

134
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I don't want to go home.

135
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
What?

136
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I don't mean anything bad.

137
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I'll take you home.

138
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
No.

139
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
After work,

140
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I went home at night.

141
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
It was so cold in the room.

142
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
It's supposed to be warm.

143
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
It's a bi-home.

144
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
It's supposed to be warm.

145
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
It's so hot.

146
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
It's so weird.

147
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
It's so hot.

148
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
It's always warm.

149
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I don't want to go home.

150
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
But we're always alone.

151
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
We're always alone.

152
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
No one is there.

153
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
It's true.

154
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
It's true.

155
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
You'll be 29 tomorrow.

156
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
You're alone.

157
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I can't be 29 tomorrow.

158
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I can't be 29 tomorrow.

159
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I can't be 29 tomorrow.

160
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I can't be 29 tomorrow.

161
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I can't.

162
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I can't be 29 tomorrow.

163
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I'm not going to sleep on this show anymore.

164
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I have a problem.

165
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Then I get a fan letter.

166
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I'll do anything.

167
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
You guys.

168
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
What do you call it?

169
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Why do you accept it like that?

170
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Why do you accept it like that?

171
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
It'll be tomorrow morning.

172
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
You can't throw away chocolate.

173
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
It's too terrible.

174
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
That's true.

175
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I'm a skater.

176
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I stepped on it.

177
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
But, you know...

178
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
You know what?

179
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Mota, I'm really happy!

180
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I'm really happy!

181
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I can't help it, but I'm really thankful.

182
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
You're thankful?

183
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Mota, what are you going to do?

184
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
That thankfulness...

185
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Why?

186
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Why are you thankful?

187
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
You have to say it!

188
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
If you're thankful, say it!

189
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
See?

190
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
You're so cute!

191
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
You're so cute!

192
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
What do you mean cute?

193
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
You just started!

194
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
No!

195
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
What do you mean cute?

196
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Your hair is so fluffy!

197
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
What do you mean?

198
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
You're so cute!

199
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Is it a cat?

200
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
You want to hug it, right?

201
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I understand that.

202
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
It's hard for a cat,

203
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
but you want to hug it.

204
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
You're so cute!

205
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
That's what you're saying, right?

206
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
The gift I got from my fans,

207
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I'm so happy!

208
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I'm so happy that I want to slap it on my tongue!

209
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
What's this?

210
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I'm so happy!

211
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
If you do it like that,

212
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
it's normal to get slapped on the tongue.

213
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
That's my best thing.

214
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
That's my best thing.

215
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
If you do it like that,

216
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I'll be so happy!

217
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
If you express it like that...

218
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
If I see your performance...

219
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Shut up!

220
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I'll be so happy.

221
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
If I say something bad...

222
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Hey!

223
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
You really believe in me, right?

224
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
You keep saying that.

225
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
There are still people who believe in me.

226
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I'll warn you.

227
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
You do this sometimes!

228
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
You do this sometimes!

229
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
You do this sometimes!

230
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I've never shown

231
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
my feminine side on TV.

232
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Really?

233
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Your gestures are all like that.

234
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
What's wrong with that?

235
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
What's wrong with that?

236
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
What's wrong with that?

237
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
What's wrong with that?

238
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
What's wrong with that?

239
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
That's what's wrong with you!

240
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I have a lot of female hormones.

241
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Why?

242
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
What's wrong with that?

243
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I don't have any female hormones.

244
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I have no female hormones.

245
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I have no female hormones.

246
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I've had no female hormones for a long time.

247
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I've had no female hormones for a long time.

248
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I have no female hormones for a long time.

249
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
It's hard!

250
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Wait!

251
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I always

252
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
do a lot of

253
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
high-level jokes.

254
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
When I do that,

255
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
it's like cold rice.

256
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I've given

257
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
wonderful dinner

258
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
and meat juice to everyone before.

259
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
It's hard!

260
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
That was also hard!

261
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I'm sure you're eating a great steak.

262
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
My high-level jokes.

263
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
At times like this,

264
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I'll make everyone eat

265
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
something like cold rice.

266
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
That's what you're doing now?

267
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
That's my joke.

268
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
It's called dinner full course.

269
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
You're talking about a piano.

270
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
That's what I'm talking about.

271
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
That's what I'm talking about.

272
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
No, you're the one who

273
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
says whether you have or don't have female hormones.

274
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Yes, I have a lot of female hormones.

275
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I'm a little

276
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
H-rated.

277
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
You're saying that because you're fat?

278
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
No, no, no.

279
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I'm a little H-rated.

280
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
What do you mean by H-rated?

281
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I've said it many times.

282
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
That's what you do!

283
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Then, as a comedian,

284
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
what kind of reaction would you have

285
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
if your father touched you?

286
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Stop it!

287
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I don't even know if you're a comedian.

288
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Then, why would your father touch you?

289
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Why would you do that?

290
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
You're just singing.

291
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
What's wrong with that?

292
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
You're just singing.

293
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
That's right.

294
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I'm waiting for a man in front of my apartment.

295
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I'm waiting for a car, so I know if he's there or not.

296
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Oh, I see.

297
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Oh, I'm on TV right now.

298
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I'm on TV right now.

299
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Oh, really?

300
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Yes.

301
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
The sky is so beautiful.

302
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
When we used to do it,

303
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
the driver would go like this.

304
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
It's not like that.

305
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
The keyhole is so deep.

306
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
The inside is so clean.

307
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I'm a professional.

308
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I don't think so.

309
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
If you don't wash your car often,

310
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
you'll get mud on your car.

311
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
You'll get mud on your car.

312
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
A few years ago,

313
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
when I was on my way to work,

314
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
next to the door,

315
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
there was a sign saying,

316
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
poop.

317
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Gyo-san,

318
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
there was a word,

319
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
but it was poop.

320
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I thought it was poop.

321
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
No, it wasn't you.

322
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
It's hard.

323
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
It's hard.

324
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I woke up early today.

325
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Oh, today?

326
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Yes.

327
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
You were here at 2 o'clock today.

328
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I was.

329
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
You can wake up at 2 o'clock.

330
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Yes, I can.

331
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Were you sleeping?

332
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
No, I wasn't.

333
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Why?

334
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
What?

335
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I was baking cookies.

336
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Hurry up and read it.

337
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Hurry up and read it.

338
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
That's not how you read it.

339
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
That's not how you read it.

340
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Hurry up and read it.

341
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
That's not how you read it.

342
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Hurry up and read it.

343
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
The other day,

344
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I was wearing a new pair of shoes

345
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
and went out.

346
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I said,

347
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I'm fat,

348
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
but can you two laugh at me?

349
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
That's the end.

350
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I can't stand fat people.

351
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I always want to eat something.

352
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Really.

353
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Yesterday,

354
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I was on my way to school.

355
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I was really fat.

356
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I wasn't in the car,

357
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
but I was really fat.

358
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I was eating something

359
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
that looked like a candy

360
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
with pink sugar on it.

361
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I don't know if you're trying

362
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
to hide the fact that you're fat.

363
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I was hiding it.

364
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I was like,

365
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Fatty, fatty.

366
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
That fat guy is funny.

367
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
He hides his sweat.

368
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
You see,

369
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
fat people breathe with their mouths.

370
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
What?

371
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
They're supposed to be made

372
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
so that they can breathe.

373
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
That's why they have holes.

374
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
What do you mean,

375
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
they breathe with their mouths?

376
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
It's time to say it.

377
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
You have to open your mouth as much as you can.

378
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
What?

379
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
It's an emergency.

380
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
It's SOS.

381
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I guess

382
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I eat twice as much.

383
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
What do you mean?

384
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I forget.

385
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I ate a while ago.

386
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
What?

387
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I didn't eat.

388
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I ate a lot,

389
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
but when I moved a little,

390
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I was like,

391
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I'm hungry.

392
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I don't eat.

393
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Fat people like juice.

394
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I like it.

395
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I'm always full.

396
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
You're still eating.

397
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Yes.

398
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
When I sit down,

399
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I drink fruit milk.

400
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Fruit milk.

401
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
When you used to do it with Bambi.

402
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I drink only fruit milk.

403
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Yes, yes.

404
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Right?

405
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
You have a club mom,

406
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
but you don't have a club dad?

407
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
You have a club dad,

408
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,000
but you don't have a club mom?

409
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
A club dad?

410
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I have a club dad,

411
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
but I don't have a club mom.

412
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I see.

413
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
You're going to be a club dad.

414
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Why?

415
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I'm not going to be a club dad.

416
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I didn't drink a lot.

417
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I thought I'd drink more.

418
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I don't know if it's because

419
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I don't read well.

420
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
It's an emotional union.

421
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
You're always doing it.

422
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
If you do that,

423
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I don't need a club mom.

424
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
See?

425
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
If you were reading now,

426
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
you'd be like this.

427
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
You can do it.

428
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I can do it.

429
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I can still use it.

430
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I don't need a club mom.

431
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I want to hear it.

432
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
If you say it like that.

433
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I see.

434
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I don't need a club mom.

435
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
You're really good.

436
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I want to hear it.

437
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I want to hear it.

438
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
You're the best.

439
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Shut up!

440
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
That's funny.

441
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Let's talk about you.

442
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
You're 71 years old.

443
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Recently,

444
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
you can tell the difference.

445
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
But you still can't tell the difference

446
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
between Machan and Hama-chan.

447
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Please tell me which one is which.

448
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Please tell me which one is which.

449
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
What should I do?

450
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
What should you do?

451
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
This is...

452
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
You know,

453
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
the fat one and the thin one.

454
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
The big one and the small one.

455
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
We don't have that many.

456
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
If I had to choose,

457
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
the spicy one

458
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
or the juicy one.

459
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
You're really good.

460
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I don't know which one is spicy

461
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
and which one is juicy.

462
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I still can't tell the difference

463
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
between Machan and Hama-chan.

464
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Machan and Hama-chan.

465
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I can hear it.

466
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I can hear it.

467
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I can hear it.

468
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Machan is watching a show.

469
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I can hear it.

470
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
He's doing a drama.

471
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Machan likes the kingdom of the wild.

472
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
He doesn't like the kingdom of the wild.

473
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
He always watches it with Harada.

474
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
They don't really get along.

475
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
You know,

476
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
in the kingdom of the wild,

477
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
there's a lion chasing a deer.

478
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
He's really excited.

479
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
He's like,

480
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Run! Run! Run!

481
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
He's like,

482
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
I'm coming! I'm coming!

483
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Machan is like that.

484
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
When he sees a lion or a deer,

485
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
he's like,

486
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Lion!

487
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
But I don't know

488
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
which one is downtown,

489
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Machan or Hama-chan.

490
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
What?

491
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I'm sorry.

492
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
I didn't get it.

493
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

494
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
What?

495
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
What did you want to say?

496
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
You watch the kingdom of the wild,

497
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
don't you?

498
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I do.

499
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
But you don't really watch

500
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
the programs we're on.

501
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
So, the old ladies

502
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
who watch the kingdom of the wild

503
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
clearly know which one is the lion or the deer.

504
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
But Machan and Hama-chan

505
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
don't really know.

506
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
So,

507
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
you're walking down the street,

508
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
and the deer is walking this way.

509
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
So,

510
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
it's the deer!

511
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I can't say it's Hama-chan.

512
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I'm pointing at the deer.

513
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
That's the old lady.

514
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Come here, Mii-kun!

515
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Who's Mii-kun?

516
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
He's my grandson.

517
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
You should ask him that.

518
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I can't do anything.

519
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
So,

520
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Mii-kun's older sister is here.

521
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I don't know if she's here.

522
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
This is my first time seeing Mii-kun.

523
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I don't know about Yocchan.

524
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
This is my older sister.

525
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Yocchan's older sister.

526
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Yocchan, come here!

527
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
The young Yocchan

528
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
is like,

529
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Hama-chan!

530
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
But you're Hama-chan!

531
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
But this is a deer!

532
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
The old lady is here.

533
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
The old lady is a deer.

534
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I see.

535
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
There's a difference between what you see and what you don't.

536
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
It's a long story.

537
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
If you could become gods

538
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
what kind of things would you make?

539
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
You'd combine something with something.

540
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Combine?

541
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
A lion and an elephant.

542
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
A lion and an elephant?

543
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
You'd combine a lion and an elephant

544
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
and make a lion and an elephant.

545
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
This is an elephant.

546
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
The whole thing.

547
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
The nose would stretch out

548
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
and the hair would go like this.

549
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
That's all there is to a lion.

550
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
That's all there is to a lion.

551
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I don't get it.

552
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Well...

553
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
You don't get it?

554
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
I'm sure there are many animals

555
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
that haven't been discovered yet.

556
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Are you talking about soil?

557
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
I'm sure there are.

558
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
There was something else.

559
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
I wonder if there really is.

560
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
A hippo?

561
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
There is a hippo.

562
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
There is a hippo?

563
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
That's a long story.

564
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
I've never seen a hippo.

565
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
That's all.

566
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I've never seen a hippo.

567
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
I get it.

568
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I'm serious.

569
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
If you go somewhere

570
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
and see a hippo

571
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
you'll know.

572
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
You'll say,

573
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I saw it in the bathroom.

574
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
I really saw it.

575
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
I didn't see it.

576
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
I was seen.

577
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
You were seen

578
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
in the bathroom.

579
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
I see.

580
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
You saw it.

581
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
You didn't see it at first.

582
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
You saw it

583
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
like this.

584
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
It was deep

585
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
and wide.

586
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
It was like this.

587
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
It was like this.

588
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
It dug a hole

589
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
in the side.

590
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
There is a hole

591
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
in the side.

592
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
There is another hole

593
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
in the side.

594
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Like a mole?

595
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Yes.

596
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
I dug a hole

597
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
and it came out.

598
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
From the hole?

599
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
From the hole.

600
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I dug a hole

601
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
and it came out.

602
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Why?

603
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Why?

604
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
What is this?

605
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Thank you for watching.
