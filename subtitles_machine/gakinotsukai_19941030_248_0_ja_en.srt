00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
In the first episode of Gaki no Tsukai Arahen, let's have a look at the beautiful and talented entertainer, Kudoki Tekugase!

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Mr. Wataru, our staff has done this before.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Yes, we have.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
It was a mess, wasn't it?

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I thought that this would not work.

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Entertainer?

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Entertainer.

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
There must have been many.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000
That's right. Among the entertainers, there were many who had a very good fortune.

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
All of them?

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
That's right.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
The three sleeping lions.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Is that so? I understand.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Then, let's have the three of them appear.

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Do these three have a very good fortune?

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
That's right.

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
You are amazing.

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Really?

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
That's great.

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
If you have a wife, you have a child.

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Don't you want to see how such people do it?

23
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
It's a handicap race.

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Speaking of which, how about this handicap?

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
This program is brought to you by the sponsor you are watching.

26
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Who will go first?

27
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
First of all, let's start with the young ones.

28
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I see.

29
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
They are very active right now.

30
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
That's right. Kanda-kun.

31
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Yes.

32
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Is the person next to you there?

33
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Yes.

34
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
That's right.

35
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
That's right.

36
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
That's right.

37
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
That's right.

38
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
That's right.

39
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Is the person next to you there?

40
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Yes.

41
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
That's great.

42
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Do you know me?

43
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
What?

44
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Yes.

45
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Look, I'm on TV.

46
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Yes.

47
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Do you know me?

48
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Kanda-san?

49
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Do you know me?

50
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Yes, I know you.

51
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I've seen you before.

52
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Really?

53
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Yes.

54
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,000
You look like Keigo Matsuzaka.

55
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I've never been told that.

56
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I knew it.

57
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Yes.

58
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
What?

59
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
That's right.

60
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Is there a type you like?

61
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Fukuyama Masaharu-san.

62
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Fukuyama Masaharu?

63
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I lost.

64
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I admit it.

65
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Fukuyama Masaharu?

66
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Yes.

67
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I see.

68
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Don't move.

69
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Don't talk like that.

70
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I know Fukuyama Masaharu.

71
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Is that so?

72
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Do you want to talk to Fukuyama Masaharu?

73
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I want to talk to him.

74
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Do you want to talk to him?

75
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Yes.

76
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Really?

77
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Let's go to the room.

78
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
He's a criminal.

79
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
He's coming.

80
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Really?

81
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Let's go.

82
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Fukuyama Masaharu.

83
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Sit down.

84
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Yes.

85
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
You have to call Fukuyama.

86
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Yes.

87
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Wait a minute.

88
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
He's doing it in real time.

89
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I don't know what's going on.

90
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Hello?

91
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Masaharu?

92
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
See you later.

93
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I don't know what's going on.

94
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
You should have told me.

95
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
You're a fool.

96
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
He can't answer the phone right now.

97
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Is that so?

98
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
You're a fool.

99
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I don't know what's going on.

100
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
You should have told me.

101
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I see.

102
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I see.

103
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Why are you doing this?

104
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I see.

105
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
If you give 100 points to Fukuyama Masaharu, how many points will I get?

106
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,000
But it's a different genre.

107
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
He said he'd buy me something.

108
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Is that so?

109
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
But...

110
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Go ahead.

111
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
You're a fool.

112
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Let's go to the restaurant.

113
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I see.

114
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Talk to him.

115
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Your fan wants you to change the phone number.

116
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Yes.

117
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Really?

118
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
What?

119
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
You're a fool.

120
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Is that so?

121
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
What?

122
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Talk to him.

123
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
You're a fool.

124
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
You should have told me.

125
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Are you kidding me?

126
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Wait a minute.

127
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
You're a fool.

128
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I don't know what's going on.

129
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Are you kidding me?

130
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
You're a fool.

131
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Are you sure?

132
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
You're a fool.

133
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Your fan wants you to change the phone number.

134
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I don't know what's going on.

135
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
But...

136
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,000
That's it.

137
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
That's it.

138
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
You're a fool.

139
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
You should have told me.

140
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
You're a fool.

141
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I don't know what's going on.

142
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I'm about to cry.

143
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Let's go to the restaurant.

144
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Okay.

145
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Would you like some juice?

146
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Would you like something to drink?

147
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Thank you for the food.

148
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
You're welcome.

149
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
You're welcome?

150
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Who asked you to do that?

151
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
May I?

152
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Sure.

153
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Oolong tea.

154
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Oolong tea.

155
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:35,000
You're a bad guy.

156
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
You're a bad guy.

157
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
You're a bad guy.

158
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Where are we going?

159
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Don't touch me.

160
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Just a little bit.

161
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Just a little bit.

162
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Where are you going to take me?

163
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
You can leave it to me.

164
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I don't like bad guys.

165
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I don't like bad guys.

166
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I'll take you.

167
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
You're a bad guy.

168
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Then, if we have a moment, we can take a picture.

169
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Sure.

170
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Why do I have to pay?

171
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
What are you going to cut?

172
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
You can leave it to me.

173
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
What?

174
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,000
You can leave it to me.

175
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
There you go.

176
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I'm bad.

177
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I'm a bad guy.

178
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I'm a bad guy.

179
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I'm a bad guy.

180
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
How many do you want?

181
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
How about that?

182
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I'm sure you can do it.

183
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
How many?

184
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
How many do you want?

185
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
How many do you want?

186
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Five.

187
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
What?

188
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Five?

189
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
What?

190
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Five.

191
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
How many?

192
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Five hundred.

193
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Five hundred?

194
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
How many?

195
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Five hundred.

196
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
One, two, three, four...

197
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
He said three million when he made my small bridge.

198
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Five million?

199
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I want to kiss you on the cheek.

200
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Okay, okay.

201
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Okay.

202
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Okay.

203
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Mahoto Ozaki.

204
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I'll let you taste the best sex in the world.

205
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
All of a sudden?

206
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I'll let you taste the best sex in the world.

207
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I came down from the sky for you.

208
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I'll let you taste the best sex in the world.

209
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
That's all?

210
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Go ahead.

211
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I'll let you taste the best sex in the world.

212
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Let's take a bath.

213
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Let's take a bath.

214
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Look at the sky.

215
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
A nice shooting star.

216
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Here it comes.

217
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
He's a manly man.

218
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I wonder if he's confident.

219
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
That he won't go home.

220
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
What?

221
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
What are you doing?

222
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I was just looking at his feet.

223
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
What's wrong?

224
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Huh?

225
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Come on.

226
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Come on.

227
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Come on.

228
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Let's have sex.

229
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Is it okay here?

230
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Is it okay here?

231
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
No!

232
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
No!

233
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Is it okay here?

234
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Come on.

235
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Don't bend over.

236
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I'm bending over.

237
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I'm rubbing against you.

238
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
What are you thinking?

239
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I'm holding you.

240
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Come on.

241
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Maachan.

242
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Maachan, try it.

243
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Next time.

244
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
If you want Maachan to do it, do it.

245
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Is that so?

246
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I know.

247
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I know.

248
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Prepare a wonderful woman.

249
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I'm wearing a microphone.

250
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Maachan version.

251
00:09:41,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Please whistle a little.

252
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
You're so fluffy today.

253
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
You're fluffy.

254
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I look warm, right?

255
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
You look warm.

256
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I'm getting cold.

257
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I see.

258
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
You have to be fashionable.

259
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I see.

260
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
You have to be fashionable.

261
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
That's right.

262
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
It's a business that can't be seen.

263
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
That's right.

264
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
You're getting red.

265
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I see.

266
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I can't think of that.

267
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
It's too late.

268
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I'm going to the magazine again.

269
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:33,000
You're still in the top five of fashionable entertainers.

270
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
You're in the top five.

271
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
What's the talent you think is a genius?

272
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I'm from China.

273
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Why?

274
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
It's nice.

275
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
It's fashionable.

276
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Why?

277
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I'm just wearing what I've been prepared for.

278
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
What you've been prepared for.

279
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Why?

280
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Who's a foreigner?

281
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I don't think it's fashionable even if I look at it today.

282
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,000
My relatives put this in a cardboard box and sent it to me when I was in elementary school.

283
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I don't like that kind of clothes.

284
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I'm sorry.

285
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I know that.

286
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I know that.

287
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I don't wear this at that time.

288
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I saw it the other day.

289
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
You're wearing pants.

290
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
That's right.

291
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
That's right.

292
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
You put out your pants up to here and lower your pants.

293
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Yes.

294
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Is that okay?

295
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
That's...

296
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
You took a picture like this.

297
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
What is it?

298
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
You're not wearing pants.

299
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I'm surprised.

300
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
What's good or bad?

301
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
What's good or bad?

302
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I know that.

303
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I know that.

304
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I don't even know what gum is.

305
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
It's similar.

306
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
It's similar, but I know that.

307
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I'm sorry, but I'm wrong.

308
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
After all, men, women, and men are the contents.

309
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
What do you mean you're training the contents?

310
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,000
For example, when I'm free, I'm in the outdoors.

311
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
That's why you're always at home.

312
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,000
No... no... no... no... No matter how many times I say it, I'm at home.

313
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I'm not at home.

314
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
You can't make it up.

315
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I don't know if you thought I knew you since elementary school, but I knew you.

316
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I don't want to know.

317
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I want you to tell me the number of my phone number.

318
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
No... no... no...

319
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
There must be a crazy country.

320
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I thought you wanted to know theây.

321
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I already know that.

322
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I don't want to go home.

323
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Your parents...

324
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
My hat is falling off.

325
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Your parents know about it.

326
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
What?

327
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Of course they know.

328
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
You're lying.

329
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
If they know, I'm lying.

330
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
You're lying.

331
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Wait a minute.

332
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
You're lying.

333
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
You're lying.

334
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
You're lying.

335
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Wait a minute.

336
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
You're lying.

337
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Wait a minute.

338
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
You're lying.

339
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
You're lying.

340
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Wait a minute.

341
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Wait a minute.

342
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
You're lying.

343
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
You're lying.

344
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Listen to me.

345
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I want to know everything.

346
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
You're lying.

347
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
You really don't know about the group?

348
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Yes, I do.

349
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
You're lying.

350
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
It's normal.

351
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
But he...

352
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
It's not normal.

353
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I want to know everything.

354
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
You don't want to know anything.

355
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
No, no.

356
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
There's something.

357
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
But I'm really strict at home.

358
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I can't teach you that.

359
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I can't do that.

360
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
No, no, no.

361
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
No, really.

362
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
No, no, no.

363
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
If I...

364
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
No, no, no.

365
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
If it's okay to ring the bell...

366
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
No, no, no.

367
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Why would I ring your bell?

368
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I don't like it.

369
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I don't want to get caught again.

370
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
If I tell you the truth now,

371
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
you won't listen to me anymore.

372
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
You won't be able to catch me anymore.

373
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
No, no, no.

374
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Don't do that.

375
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I mean...

376
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Don't pay attention to me.

377
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Oh, really?

378
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Where do you live now?

379
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I don't know.

380
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Where do you live?

381
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
You're saying that, but I'm asking you little by little.

382
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
No.

383
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I want to prove it.

384
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Where do you live?

385
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I can't tell you that right now.

386
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
No, no, no.

387
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
That's fine.

388
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I'm just saying that my head is a 3.

389
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
You must be a little nervous right now.

390
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Oh, it's a 3.

391
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Should I say it quickly?

392
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
It's okay to be nervous just by hearing 3.

393
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I'm telling you that you know me,

394
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
but you don't know anything.

395
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Oh, at first.

396
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Do you know that I'm into cooking lately?

397
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Oh, really?

398
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
This is amazing.

399
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
It's my one-pack curry.

400
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
What is that?

401
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
You're making it while running around.

402
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Are you a fool?

403
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.

404
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
What's in it?

405
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
What's in it?

406
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Oh, it's amazing.

407
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
No, no, no.

408
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
What's in it?

409
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
First of all,

410
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:39,000
band-aid.

411
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
What's in it?

412
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Makiron.

413
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Makiron?

414
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Yes.

415
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Beedaman.

416
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Beedaman.

417
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Well, well.

418
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
It's my one-pack curry.

419
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I wonder how many of you have been there lately.

420
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I've been waiting for the car to start all the time.

421
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I can't stop.

422
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
What? No way.

423
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
They're waiting for me.

424
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
When I say thank you, they ring the doorbell.

425
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
They're waiting for me.

426
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Boo!

427
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
They're always ringing the doorbell.

428
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,000
That's funny.

429
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:30,000
You know, cars are just like humans.

430
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:35,000
For example, a wiper is a hand.

431
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
You mean I have to pay with this?

432
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Yes, yes, yes.

433
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
When you cry, you use your hand like this.

434
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
That's a wiper.

435
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Passing means, you know,

436
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
when the previous one was melted,

437
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
if you do this, the light goes like this.

438
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,000
This is like, huh?

439
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
And when you shake it,

440
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
you ring the doorbell,

441
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
saying, thank you.

442
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Thank you.

443
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Boo!

444
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I know that.

445
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
What you did was...

446
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Thank you for this trip.

447
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Thank you for this trip.

448
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
We talked all the time.

449
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
All the time.

450
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
No, no, no.

451
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,000
This trip is really...

452
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
It's been cold lately, hasn't it?

453
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
It's been cold, hasn't it?

454
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:29,000
It's a little lonely to sleep alone.

455
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
No, really.

456
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I mean, I only sleep alone.

457
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
But when you're done, you're like,

458
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
hurry up and go home!

459
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
You're alone when you sleep.

460
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
When I'm done?

461
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
It's bitter.

462
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I don't know if it's that bitter.

463
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Isn't it Heiko-kun?

464
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
No!

465
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I was waiting for Heiko-kun.

466
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
No, it's not.

467
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
There are times when I want to push you.

468
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Ah.

469
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Shall we go?

470
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Yes, go ahead.

471
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
When I posed like this,

472
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
my spine went crazy.

473
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
What?

474
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Nothing.

475
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
You wanted to show me

476
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,000
putting a hat in the back, didn't you?

477
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
If you talk like this,

478
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
you can see it all the time.

479
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Enjoy the various angles of Masatoshi.

480
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Is that so?

481
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:36,000
This is from someone who knows me.

482
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Ah, is that so?

483
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Yes.

484
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Pen name.

485
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
It's from the 4th comedian,

486
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Yamasaki Hosei-san.

487
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
First of all, there's a request below.

488
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Please put a song on this poem.

489
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Is that okay?

490
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
The title is,

491
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:55,000
A Crystal Night.

492
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Please take a seat here.

493
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
It started with a greeting.

494
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Come alone.

495
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I don't want to play games alone.

496
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Come on.

497
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Come on.

498
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Come on.

499
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Hurry up.

500
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Well, well, well.

501
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I wrote a lot of songs.

502
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Ah, songs.

503
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Well, yes.

504
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Is that so?

505
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I wrote a lot of songs.

506
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Anything?

507
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
What I do is,

508
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Well, I don't have a piano today.

509
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
How do you always make it?

510
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Well,

511
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
What are you talking about?

512
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Why are you seriously saying,

513
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Well,

514
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
First of all,

515
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Do you have any talent like this?

516
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
No, I don't.

517
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Well, well, well.

518
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:44,000
I wonder how much an amateur can do.

519
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
It's a love song.

520
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
It's different at this point.

521
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
No.

522
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I'm an artist.

523
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Ah, that's good.

524
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Greeting, from a greeting.

525
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,000
It's different.

526
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
From a greeting.

527
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Ah, it's kind of like Shibukakitai.

528
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
OK, OK, OK.

529
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
A new story of Shibukakitai.

530
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Let's go.

531
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Love, love, love, love.

532
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
It started with a greeting.

533
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Are you changing it?

534
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I'm sorry.

535
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
That's love, love, love, love.

536
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
How is it? Ballad?

537
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
How do you want me to do it?

538
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Please call me Shanson.

539
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Shanson, right?

540
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Ah, Shanson.

541
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Yes.

542
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Ah, it's kind of like Shibukakitai.

543
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Thank you very much.

544
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Ah, Shanson, right?

545
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,000
What are you talking about?

546
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I don't know the lyrics.

547
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Well, the lyrics are good.

548
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
I'll kill you.

549
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Hey.

550
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Do you want to die?

551
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Then, let's do it like a ballad.

552
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Yes.

553
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,000
It started with a greeting.

554
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Ah, that's not it.

555
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
It started with a greeting.

556
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:25,000
You're like Dragon Ball.

557
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
You're like Pac-Man.

558
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
I'm serious.

559
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
It started with a greeting.

560
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Wait a minute.

561
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,000
That's a long story.

562
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Can you do it properly?

563
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
What's your name?

564
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Kamizono Shiro.

565
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Who is it?

566
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Who is it?

567
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
The lyrics are different when you say Shiro.

568
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Kamizono Shiro.

569
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Four.

570
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,000
I used to sing two songs before.

571
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
That's amazing.

572
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Megitsune no Onna.

573
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I don't know.

574
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
What's Megitsune no Onna?

575
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
It was very popular.

576
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
It became a million seller.

577
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
There was a title called Megitsune no Onna.

578
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:23,000
The title of the cover was Hey Melo.

579
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,000
I don't know why.

00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Help me.

00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000

00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:39,000
The last album was a big hit.

583
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
I didn't expect such a big hit.

584
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,000
It was a million seller.

585
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
The second song is expected.

586
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,000
It's a long story.

587
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
It's a long story.

588
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
This song has been broadcasted many times.

589
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Kamizono Shiro will perform for the first time on TV.

590
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Please sing Crystal Night.

591
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Roomba.

592
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Roomba.

593
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Roomba.

594
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:34,000
I'm tired.

595
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
I feel sick.

596
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
I feel sick.

597
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Are you okay?

598
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
What are you talking about?

599
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Your hands are dirty.

600
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
I feel sick.

601
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000

00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
I'm scared.

605
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
I feel sick.

606
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:16,000
I feel sick.

607
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Don't do that.

608
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:25,000
