1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
The usual music shop, a small town with a calm atmosphere and a stop.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
But today, there is a feeling of something.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Excuse me, somebody has blocked my man's car outside.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Who wants to know who it is?

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Yeah, I gotta go somewhere. I got something to do.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
You gotta go to work. His car.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
BMW has been stopped.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Who has a wife?

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Somebody is blocking my car.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
BMW has been blocked.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Who are you to say that?

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Okay, okay, I'm sorry.

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
What?

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
BMW has been blocked.

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I think it's him, man.

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
You blocking the car?

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Black BMW. White Toyota.

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Sorry, sorry.

19
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Very sorry, kid.

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Let's go, let's go.

21
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Very sorry.

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
What?

23
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Let's go. Come on.

24
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
We're waiting too.

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Hurry up.

26
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Okay, okay.

27
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
You.

28
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I left it there.

29
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
You're so pathetic.

30
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
You guys are so pathetic.

31
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
When was it?

32
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
It's been there all the time.

33
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
You're like, let's take it, let's take it.

34
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
You came right away.

35
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
You saved me.

36
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
You guys are so lame.

37
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
You can sing that song.

38
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
BMW has been blocked.

39
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
It's my fault.

40
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I apologized.

41
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Why are you apologizing?

42
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
It's my fault.

43
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Why are you apologizing?

44
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Hey!

45
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
What are you doing?

46
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
The picture, the picture.

47
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I'm just saying I'm scared because a foreigner came.

48
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Stop it, Masaki.

49
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Stop it.

50
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Stop it.

51
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Hey.

52
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Apologize.

53
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Sorry, sorry.

54
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Stop it, stop it.

55
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
What are you doing, Okamoto-san?

56
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
That's why I'm going to teach you Okamoto Hangar 5 Shinju today.

57
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
What?

58
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,900
The brief

59
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Manager Okamoto is angry again.

60
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Hangar 5 Shinju

61
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Shinju development

62
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
This program is provided by the sponsor you are watching.

63
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I'm going to do it now.

64
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Do it yourself.

65
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
What?

66
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Why are you making it?

67
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

68
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
What are you doing?

69
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Break the balloon with this.

70
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Break the balloon?

71
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
With this?

72
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
With this?

73
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Who are you?

74
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
You can't break it with this.

75
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
How to break it?

76
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
How to break it?

77
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
It's really hard.

78
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
How to break it?

79
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
You can't break it with this.

80
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
You have to be more energetic.

81
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Be more energetic.

82
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I'll show you how to break it.

83
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
You are fatter than Hong Kong.

84
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
It's different from Shinju.

85
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I'm getting hungry.

86
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I'm getting hungry.

87
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Okamoto has changed.

88
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Shinju development

89
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Shinju development

90
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Shinju development

91
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Next.

92
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I'll show you when someone attacks you.

93
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Slowly.

94
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Slowly.

95
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Slowly.

96
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I'll make it easy to understand.

97
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Ouch.

98
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I'm scared.

99
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I'm scared.

100
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Are you ok?

101
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Next.

102
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I'll show you how to break a gun.

103
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
There is no gun.

104
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Damn it.

105
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Damn it.

106
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
What's wrong with you?

107
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
What's wrong with you?

108
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
What's wrong with you?

109
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
What's wrong with you?

110
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
What's wrong with you?

111
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I'll show you how to break a gun.

112
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I think you can do it.

113
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I'll show you how to break a candle.

114
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Ouch.

115
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Ouch.

116
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:22,000
What's wrong with you?

117
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
My heart is beating.

118
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:36,000
What's wrong with you?

119
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I'll show you how to break a gun.

120
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I'll help you.

121
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
With a hammer?

122
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
This is the only way to break a gun.

123
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
You can't do it with a hammer.

124
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Cool.

125
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I'll show you how to break a octopus.

126
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
It's a octopus.

127
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Is it an octopus?

128
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Is it an octopus?

129
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Is it an octopus?

130
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Is it a octopus?

131
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I'll help you.

132
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
It's touching.

133
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Why do you have such a voice sometimes?

134
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Why do you have such a voice sometimes?

135
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Who is Shibattan?

136
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
It's an octopus.

137
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Octopus is Shibattan?

138
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Octopus is Shibattan.

139
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
That's enough.

140
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
You're mixing it with the hangar.

141
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Why?

142
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Where should I go in?

143
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
It's too far.

144
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
It's too far for a beautiful woman.

145
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I'll go from here.

146
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Yes, please.

147
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
You're passing in front of me.

148
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Where is the hangar?

149
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I forgot the hangar.

150
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Where is the hangar?

151
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I'll fix the hangar.

152
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
You guys should try it.

153
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
What should we do with the hangar?

154
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
You guys should try it.

155
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I'll fix the hangar.

156
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I'll fix the hangar.

157
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
It's too far.

158
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
It's too far for a beautiful woman.

159
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
No, it's OK.

160
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
You're using the hangar as a handle.

161
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Yes, it's a handle.

162
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I thought it would be a rope.

163
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
What's with that face?

164
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
What's with that face?

165
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Watch it.

166
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Let's go.

167
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I don't know what I'm doing.

168
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Today's live is terrible.

169
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
It's the worst.

170
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
It's been a long time.

171
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I have a headache.

172
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I have a headache.

173
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I thought I was going to die.

174
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I don't know what to do.

175
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I woke up with a headache last night.

176
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I have a headache.

177
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I have a headache.

178
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I have a headache.

179
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
The day before yesterday?

180
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
The day before yesterday.

181
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I have a headache.

182
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I know when it's raining.

183
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I know when it's raining.

184
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
It's been raining for three days.

185
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Yes.

186
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I have a headache.

187
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
No.

188
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
What you say and what you do are different.

189
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
What you say and what you do are different.

190
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
It's like a scene play.

191
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Let's go to the dentist.

192
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
You're fast.

193
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
You're fast.

194
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I'm not fast.

195
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
This is my personal opinion.

196
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Personal opinion?

197
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
You're here after the opening.

198
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I see.

199
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I had a fight with someone.

200
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Who?

201
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
A member of the video?

202
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
A member of the video?

203
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Yes.

204
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Can you go to the video?

205
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Of course.

206
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Can you write the address?

207
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Of course.

208
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Can you write the phone number?

209
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I can write the office number.

210
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
You can't write it.

211
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I'm a talent.

212
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
But there are people who write the address in the video.

213
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Yes.

214
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
That's enough.

215
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
You have a broken face.

216
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
You can't run away.

217
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I was very angry.

218
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
You have a broken jaw.

219
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Not only in the front, but in the side.

220
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Please listen to me.

221
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I'm a talent.

222
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
No matter how much money I have.

223
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:58,000
No matter how much money I have.

224
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Of course, if I'm an amateur, I write everything.

225
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I can't do that.

226
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I became a member of Yamanaki.

227
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I became a member of Yamanaki.

228
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
That's good.

229
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
That's good.

230
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I took the money.

231
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I took the money.

232
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I took the money.

233
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I took the money.

234
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I took the money.

235
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I was beaten.

236
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I was beaten.

237
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I was beaten.

238
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I was beaten.

239
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I said, what?

240
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I can't lend money to you.

241
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I was angry.

242
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I was angry.

243
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I said, wait.

244
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Why don't you understand that I'm not Yamazaki?

245
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I know about you.

246
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:55,000
It's a woman, isn't it?

247
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I know about you, too.

248
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I don't understand.

249
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
It's a woman.

250
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
That's good.

251
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I may be taking the money, so I probably have to say it.

252
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
But my face is cracked.

253
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I know that I'm not Yamazaki.

254
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Yamazaki is a talent.

255
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,500
You probably know Yamazaki too, right?

256
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:19,000
Yes, yes, yes.

257
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:19,500
Right?

258
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,000
Eh?

259
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:20,500
What?

260
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,000
Yes, yes, yes.

261
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
You know me, and you know Yamazaki too?

262
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,500
Yes.

263
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,000
Why don't you lend it to me?

264
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Pah!

265
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Moreover, there are so many down-to-earth videos in the world!

266
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
It's not such a bad thing!

267
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I'll throw it away!

268
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I don't want to live!

269
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
If you throw it away, you won't be able to grow up!

270
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
And then, I went out!

271
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I'm already 33 years old.

272
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
When I went out, I was a little annoyed.

273
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:52,500
Why?

274
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:57,000
These days, the automatic door is like this, right?

275
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,500
The timing is bad!

276
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:03,000
Are you there?

277
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,500
Why?

278
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:08,000
You can't just go like this!

279
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
You can open and close the door like this!

280
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Are you there?

281
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
What's going on?

282
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Did you stop properly?

283
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I lied a little, didn't I?

284
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
What are you talking about?

285
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I lied a little, didn't I?

286
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I lied a little, didn't I?

287
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
If you say it in detail, I think it's more correct.

288
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
That's right.

289
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:33,500
Right?

290
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:37,000
That's right!

291
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
What is it?

292
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Did you sing?

293
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
No, that's not it.

294
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
It's strange, isn't it?

295
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
The part-time worker also has a lot of money, isn't it?

296
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Even if you just go, you're smiling a little, aren't you?

297
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I'm smiling, I'm smiling.

298
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
You're smiling, aren't you?

299
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Can you tell such a guy his address?

300
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
It's a little funny.

301
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
It's a little funny, isn't it?

302
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
The guy in a different store also looks like this.

303
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
The guy in a different store is also a little funny.

304
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
What are you talking about?

305
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I'm not talking to you!

306
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I'm not talking to you!

307
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I'm talking to you!

308
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I'm angry.

309
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I'm angry, too.

310
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Even if you go shopping, if you order something big, it will be delivered, right?

311
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
What do you buy big things?

312
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
What do you buy big things?

313
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Do you buy such expensive things?

314
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
It's not expensive.

315
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
What?

316
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
It's very cheap.

317
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Is that true?

318
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
It's true!

319
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
What is it?

320
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
It's very cheap.

321
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Such as a toilet board.

322
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
What do you do with a toilet board?

323
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
You can't use it in such a situation.

324
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
You can't use it.

325
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
It's hard.

326
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
But you can't bring it to me.

327
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
That's right.

328
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
You can't bring it to me.

329
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
That's why I used to buy a phone once.

330
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I went to the employee there.

331
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
You went to play?

332
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
That's right.

333
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Wow!

334
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Isn't it?

335
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
You played?

336
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
No.

337
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
What?

338
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I played a little.

339
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Don't pinch me.

340
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I played a little.

341
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I can't teach you.

342
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
What did you do with the past?

343
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:18,000
How did you bring the various things in your house?

344
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I can't say that.

345
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Then do it like that.

346
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
No, no, no.

347
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I can't write my address.

348
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I can't put it in.

349
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
That's a thing that can be brought home.

350
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
This is the sad part of talent.

351
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Even if you want a sofa like this, you can't bring it home.

352
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
You have to buy a sofa like this.

353
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Is it like this?

354
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,000
At home...

355
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
A sofa is fine.

356
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Why did you come all the way here?

357
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
What are you doing?

358
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I'm using the remote control of the TV.

359
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
It's so small.

360
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
It's so small.

361
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
It's so small.

362
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
It's really hard.

363
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
If you say that, what are you going to do about the delivery?

364
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I can't even eat pizza.

365
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
But you've been ordering pizza for a long time, haven't you?

366
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
That's not good.

367
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I like it when it's halved in the middle.

368
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
The taste is different.

369
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I like it when it looks like it's been cooked.

370
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I like it.

371
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I eat it often.

372
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
You're a parasite.

373
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
What you're saying is different from what you're doing.

374
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I remembered the delivery.

375
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
When you bring the delivery, you have to sing.

376
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I can't sing anymore.

377
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I can't sing.

378
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
It doesn't sound like the delivery.

379
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:00,000
It doesn't sound like the delivery.

380
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
The delivery was yesterday.

381
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Who was it?

382
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I brought the delivery.

383
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I was on TV all morning.

384
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,360
You're on TV all morning.

385
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:20,360
You know, there are two guys who are obviously in a relationship with each other.

386
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:25,360
They have a little quarrel with each other.

387
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,360
They even accept each other.

388
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,360
Isn't that strange?

389
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,360
They are obviously in a relationship with each other.

390
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:37,360
Do you think the other guy is in a relationship with you?

391
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:41,360
And do you know that the other guy knows about your relationship with him?

392
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:45,360
No, but if they are in a relationship with each other, they should be able to understand each other.

393
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,360
That's strange.

394
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,360
Mr. Matsumoto is actually a single man.

395
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,360
What are the other five guys doing now?

396
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:00,360
As I thought, they are all in a relationship with each other.

397
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,360
I'm the eldest.

398
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:08,360
I have five more children.

399
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:11,360
One of them is a woman.

400
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:14,360
All of them are not men.

401
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:17,360
One, two, three.

402
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:23,360
I don't want to say two.

403
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:26,360
One, two, three, four, five.

404
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:29,360
What are you doing?

405
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:33,360
What are the other five guys doing?

406
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,360
I'm the captain.

407
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:38,360
What are you doing?

408
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:41,360
I'm the captain.

409
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,360
All of them are the same age?

410
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:47,360
Yes, all of them are the same age.

411
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,360
There are still five guys who are 33 years old.

412
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,360
That's right.

413
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:54,360
Are you the captain?

414
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,360
Yes, I am.

415
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,360
What's your position?

416
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:00,360
I'm the fourth.

417
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:03,360
Why did you suddenly change your position?

418
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,360
I'm the fifth.

419
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:09,360
You are in a relationship with each other.

420
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,360
What about your younger brother?

421
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,360
I'm the second.

422
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,360
I don't know if it's a family picture.

423
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:23,360
All of them have their own signs.

424
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,360
I see.

425
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:28,360
They go their own way.

426
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:31,360
What are you doing?

427
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,360
What are the other two guys doing?

428
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:37,360
I'm in a relationship with each other.

429
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:40,360
You can't do that.

430
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:43,360
You are in a relationship with each other.

431
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,360
I'm in a relationship with each other.

432
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,360
What?

433
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:51,360
I don't want you to say anything about the other two guys.

434
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:54,360
I heard it for the first time.

435
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,360
I'm sorry.

436
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:59,360
Don't say anything about the other two guys.

437
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:02,360
I will not say anything about the other two.

438
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:05,360
What's your position?

439
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,360
I'm the fourth.

440
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:11,360
You are in a relationship with each other.

441
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,360
You are in a relationship with each other.

442
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:17,360
What are you doing?

443
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,360
I'm in a relationship with each other.

444
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:23,360
Are you in a marriage?

445
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:26,360
I'm in a relationship with each other.

446
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,360
Where did you do it?

447
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,360
At the JAL.

448
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,360
JAL?

449
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,360
JAL.

450
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,360
At the JAL.

451
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,360
At the JAL?

452
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,360
I'm sorry.

453
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,360
I turned the door mode on at the JAL.

454
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,360
That's because you were announced.

455
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,360
I'm doing it even though I'm not announced.

456
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,360
That's not good.

457
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,360
Everyone will jump out.

458
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,360
That's because you're great.

459
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,360
That's because you're great.

460
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,360
If you're great, you shouldn't do it even more.

461
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,360
That's selfish.

462
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,360
I think I turned it off.

463
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:52,360
It doesn't matter if you turn it on or off.

464
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,360
I'm doing it happily.

465
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:59,360
Mitsuko is a four-legged pilot.

466
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,360
She's a four-legged pilot.

467
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,360
She's the fifth.

468
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,360
She's the fifth.

469
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,360
She's the fifth.

470
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,360
She's amazing now.

471
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:07,360
Next time...

472
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,360
I don't know if I should say this.

473
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:10,360
I'll say Atlanta next time.

474
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:18,360
In the sushi restaurant, you can tell the order of the dishes by the order you order them.

475
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:23,360
What should I order first so that I can't be underestimated at the sushi restaurant where I go for the first time?

476
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,360
Do you want to go to the sushi restaurant?

477
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:26,360
I go there once in a while.

478
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,360
You only go there once in a while.

479
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,360
I like sushi very much.

480
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,360
You should tell me what you want to eat first.

481
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,360
You should tell me what you want to eat first.

482
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,360
Welcome.

483
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,360
First of all, octopus.

484
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,360
That's a new half.

485
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:44,360
First of all, let's eat a big fatty tuna.

486
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:46,360
Sushi is the same as martial arts.

487
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,360
It's definitely different.

488
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,360
Welcome. What do you want to eat?

489
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:53,360
I'll eat a big fatty tuna.

490
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,360
When I say the word, it comes out like this.

491
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:58,360
You said octopus earlier.

492
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,360
Octopus.

493
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,360
When I say the word, it comes out like this.

494
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,360
You can't underestimate it.

495
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,360
What kind of attack is that?

496
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,360
I see.

497
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,360
First of all, it's Otoro.

498
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:23,360
If it's Otoro, it means that I also pulled it out like this.

499
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,360
It's done.

500
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,360
What should I do next?

501
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,360
And then you dig it into the rope.

502
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,360
Why?

503
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:34,360
Because the next order is coming.

504
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,360
Digging into the rope.

505
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:38,360
What do you mean by digging into the rope?

506
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,360
After Otoro?

507
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,360
After Otoro, yes.

508
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,360
Digging, digging into the rope.

509
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,360
What's the next order?

510
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,360
Shrimp.

511
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,360
Shrimp?

512
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:50,360
That's what a masked wrestler would do.

513
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,360
Why?

514
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,360
You dig into the rope and then pull it out.

515
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,360
You're just doing it on your own.

516
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,360
I can't do it.

517
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,360
If it's a stubborn old man, he'll get angry.

518
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,360
What's that?

519
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:12,360
What are you going to do after you eat Otoro and get thrown out of the rope?

520
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:15,360
When I come back...

521
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,360
What?

522
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,360
Otoro.

523
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,360
This is unexpected.

524
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:29,360
What do you want me to do?

525
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,360
This is the hard part.

526
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,360
This is the hard part.

527
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:34,360
The person over there is scared.

528
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:35,360
I didn't think Otoro would come twice.

529
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,360
That's right.

530
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:39,360
I thought Otoro would eat a lot of sushi.

531
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,360
That's right.

532
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,360
That's what I thought.

533
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,360
I thought Otoro would eat a lot of sushi.

534
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,360
I see.

535
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,360
What's the third order?

536
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,360
What?

537
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,360
What's the third order?

538
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,360
It's time.

539
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:51,360
It's not time.

540
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,360
It's not raw.

541
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,360
It's impossible.

542
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:57,360
It's not impossible.

543
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,360
It's not raw.

544
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,360
It's a gift corner.

545
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:06,360
What is this?

546
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:08,360
Hangar goldfish.

547
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:11,360
You're not going to wash it, are you?

548
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,360
Ouch!

549
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,360
Ouch!

550
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,360
Ouch!

551
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:17,360
Ouch!

552
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:19,360
What is this?

553
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,360
What kind of play is this?

554
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,360
Ouch!

555
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,360
Are you really going to do it?

556
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,360
Are you really going to do it?

557
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:30,360
Are you really going to do it?

558
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,360
I'm sorry.

559
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,360
Did you lose your shoulder again?

560
