1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
It's the O-san team!

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,000
Do you have any experience?

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
I don't have any.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
You don't, right?

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I have almost no experience.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Did you do it?

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Yes, I did.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Where did you do it?

9
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
What do you mean?

10
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Where did you do it?

11
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Where was the position?

12
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:21,500
What?

13
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:23,000
Where was the position?

14
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Po?

15
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Position.

16
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
What are you talking about?

17
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
What are you talking about?

18
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I don't know.

19
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
You don't have any experience.

20
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Do you want to do it right away?

21
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Do you have a judge?

22
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I don't have one.

23
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Oh, you have one.

24
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Thank you.

25
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
From now on,

26
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
this coin, 100 yen, will be yours.

27
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Are you listening to me?

28
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Shut up!

29
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Shut up!

30
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
You stole it!

31
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
You stole it, didn't you?

32
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
You stole it, didn't you?

33
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Ready!

34
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Ready!

35
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Why did you do that?

36
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
You just need to whistle.

37
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
That's right.

38
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I have to say everything?

39
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
That's right.

40
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Ready!

41
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I can't hold this ball.

42
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Ready!

43
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Stand up!

44
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Stand up!

45
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Stand up!

46
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Stand up!

47
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
It hurts so much.

48
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
From here.

49
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
When I was doing it,

50
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
it wasn't like this.

51
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I didn't even have a ball.

52
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
What are you doing?

53
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Ready!

54
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Go!

55
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Go!

56
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Go!

57
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Go!

58
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Go!

59
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Go!

60
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Go!

61
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Go!

62
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Go!

63
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Go!

64
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Go!

65
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Go!

66
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Go!

67
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Go!

68
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Go!

69
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Go!

70
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I'm scared.

71
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
It hurts.

72
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
From here.

73
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Is this funny?

74
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
It hurts so much.

75
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Ready!

76
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Go!

77
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Go!

78
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Go!

79
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Go!

80
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Go!

81
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Go!

82
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Go!

83
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Go!

84
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Go!

85
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Go!

86
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Go!

87
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Go!

88
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Go!

89
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Go!

90
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Ready!

91
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Go!

92
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I didn't tell the office

93
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
when I left the key.

94
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I was calling for this.

95
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Who are you?

96
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Who are you?

97
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Who are you?

98
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Who are you?

99
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Hey!

100
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Mom!

101
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Goal!

102
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
We won!

103
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
18-0.

104
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
The Hammers win.

105
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
You played.

106
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I did.

107
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I did.

108
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I did.

109
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Look at that.

110
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Superball.

111
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I've never seen it.

112
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
You played.

113
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I've never seen it.

114
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
You look like an old hero.

115
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Who's that?

116
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Let's have three players from my team.

117
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
What's that?

118
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Let's do it.

119
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Sure.

120
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
We're going to borrow your chest.

121
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Really?

122
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
We're going to borrow your chest.

123
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I see.

124
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Look at me.

125
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
My muscles are like art.

126
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
They're so beautiful.

127
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
You can't see this beauty on TV.

128
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Who's that?

129
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
He's from Harvard.

130
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
From Harvard?

131
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Yes.

132
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
From Harvard?

133
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Yes.

134
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I'm going to borrow your chest.

135
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Goal!

136
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
What's going on?

137
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I thought you were going to come.

138
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
At first...

139
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I thought you were going to come.

140
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
At first...

141
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I don't know much about amateurs.

142
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
What's going on?

143
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I get it now.

144
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I get it now.

145
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I get it now.

146
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I get it now.

147
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Goal!

148
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
This is not how I do it.

149
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
What do you mean?

150
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I don't know.

151
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
This is not how I do it.

152
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Really?

153
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I see.

154
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I used to do this with my neck.

155
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Thank you so much.

156
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Come back again.

157
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I'll go eat something.

158
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Thank you.

159
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I'll show you another one.

160
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
What are you doing?

161
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I'm doing business.

162
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Ladies and gentlemen.

163
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
To be honest, how do you feel?

164
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
When you come out of the bar, people are screaming, right?

165
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Are you happy about that?

166
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Or are you not happy about it?

167
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I'd be happy if it was a normal voice like now.

168
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Sometimes there are people who sound a bit painful.

169
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
They're like, I'll say something, just remember it!

170
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
It's a bit tough to be made to understand that kind of thing.

171
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I was really angry the other day.

172
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
It's been a while.

173
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I was angry after a long time.

174
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I was driving.

175
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
There were a lot of traffic lights.

176
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
The fans were standing there.

177
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Even on my way home, it was like that.

178
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I wanted to receive the fan letters as much as I could.

179
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
No, no, no.

180
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
What's so funny?

181
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
The traffic lights stop, right?

182
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Then the big ones gather.

183
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I don't think you can do it.

184
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I can open the window.

185
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I can open the window.

186
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:09,000
When you open the window, the empty space is dug in.

187
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I was really angry.

188
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
It turned red and blue.

189
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I closed the window.

190
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
When I was about to close the window, a video came out.

191
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
And you stopped it.

192
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
The video was stuck in the window.

193
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I thought it was going to come out again.

194
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I opened the window and the video came out.

195
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
It's terrible!

196
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
You guys!

197
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I don't want to do that.

198
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
What are you doing?

199
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
It's a sudden pose.

200
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Wait a minute.

201
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I don't want to do that.

202
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
If it were you, you wouldn't have done that.

203
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I'm sure the video came out of the window.

204
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I'm sure the video came out of your mouth.

205
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I'm sure the video came out of your mouth.

206
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,000
When you get in the car, I think you'll understand how I feel for the first time.

207
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
When you get in the car, I think you'll understand how I feel for the first time.

208
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
You always say,

209
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
It's dangerous.

210
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Be careful.

211
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Don't say that.

212
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
It's dangerous.

213
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Be careful.

214
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I'm sure it's a lie.

215
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Why do you want so many fans?

216
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I'm angry with that commercial.

217
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
The one with Yuji Oda.

218
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I opened the window and the video came out of my mouth.

219
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
What is that?

220
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I'm angry with that commercial.

221
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Idiot.

222
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Idiot.

223
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
How annoying would you be if you did that?

224
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I think some idiot would be like,

225
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I think some idiot would be like,

226
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I don't think we understood that.

227
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,000
When I was a kid, I didn't drive a car.

228
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I don't know how important it is.

229
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I drew a lot of things with a marker.

230
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I drew the door on one side.

231
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
It was a delivery truck.

232
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I was driving all the time.

233
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
It says rice here.

234
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I don't understand.

235
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I don't think I can drive it myself.

236
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
If you did that, you wouldn't complain so much.

237
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
You shouldn't complain now.

238
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
You're dirty.

239
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I don't understand myself.

240
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I don't understand myself.

241
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I don't understand myself.

242
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I don't like it when someone does that to me.

243
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Why?

244
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I always have Maria on my shoulder.

245
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
What?

246
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I don't like that.

247
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I have some contradictions.

248
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
For example,

249
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
if I had a daughter when I was young,

250
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I would take good care of her.

251
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I don't like that.

252
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I don't like that.

253
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
If I had 12 daughters,

254
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
If I had 12 daughters,

255
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I would take good care of them.

256
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I don't like that.

257
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I've done that before.

258
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I don't like that.

259
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I've done that before.

260
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Were you taking care of her?

261
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
No, I wasn't.

262
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I wasn't taking care of her.

263
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
You're a criminal.

264
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
You should go to college.

265
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
For example,

266
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
if I had a girlfriend,

267
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I couldn't get mad at her.

268
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I've done that before.

269
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
It doesn't matter if she has a girlfriend or not.

270
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
My father is strict with me.

271
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
My father is strict with me.

272
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I can't get mad at him.

273
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I can't get mad at him.

274
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I can't get mad at him.

275
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Hello.

276
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Hello.

277
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
My name is Matsumoto.

278
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
My name is Matsumoto.

279
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
What kind of relationship do you have?

280
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
What kind of relationship do you have?

281
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
What should I say?

282
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
For example,

283
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
if you're a friend of my school...

284
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I'll say that I'm a friend of your school.

285
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I'll say that I'm a friend of your school.

286
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
But what kind of friend are you?

287
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
You keep attacking me with questions.

288
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
You push me away.

289
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
You push me away.

290
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
What are you talking about?

291
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
You push me away.

292
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I can't avoid you.

293
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I can't avoid you.

294
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
What are you doing?

295
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Don't take it back.

296
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
What are you doing?

297
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
You're talking about my daughter.

298
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
You're talking about my daughter.

299
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I can say that.

300
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
My parents know that my daughter is mean.

301
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
So I don't want to talk about it.

302
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I don't want to talk about it.

303
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
In a different sense.

304
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
But it is obvious that my daughter is mean.

305
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
But it is obvious that my daughter is mean.

306
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
But parents don't notice it.

307
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
It's not that they don't notice it.

308
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
When I was in elementary school, I was still cute.

309
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
When I was in middle school and high school,

310
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
as a parent,

311
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I was like,

312
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I'm home.

313
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
But when I was a married man,

314
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I looked at my daughter and said,

315
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Look at my dad.

316
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Ah, look at that.

317
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
It's become so hard these days.

318
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
The color of your forehead has changed.

319
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Don't say it out loud, dad.

320
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Don't say it out loud!

321
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I know that.

322
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
But look at that, dad.

323
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
There's that kind of thing, right?

324
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Yes, there is.

325
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Say it out loud.

326
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Ah, it's so hard.

327
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
You're so big.

328
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
If you say it out loud, it'll be so smelly.

329
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
That's true.

330
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
That's true.

331
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Even for celebrities,

332
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
there are some girls who get married and get a daughter.

333
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
It's so hard.

334
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
And they appear on morning TV shows as their parents.

335
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
It's so hard!

336
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
The host can't even get this far.

337
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Don't say it out loud!

338
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Don't say it out loud!

339
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Say it out loud!

340
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,000
This is the hardest thing I've ever done.

341
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
It's that person.

342
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
It's that guy.

343
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:56,000
His daughter is a gorilla.

344
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Are you serious?

345
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I've never seen that.

346
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
That's why I'm sitting here.

347
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I was so surprised.

348
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I wonder why he's here.

349
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I wonder why he's here.

350
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
He's smiling right next to me.

351
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
What's that?

352
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
What?

353
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I'm going to tell you everything.

354
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
And...

355
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
He's a f***ing old man.

356
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Everyone thinks of him as an old man.

357
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
He's a middle-aged man.

358
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
The girl I married the other day

359
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
is also a weirdo.

360
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
She's a weirdo.

361
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
But if you marry her,

362
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:54,000
she'll fall in love with you at first sight.

363
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
If you were asked to change your nickname

364
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,000
from a 30-year-old to Machan-Hama-chan,

365
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
what would you change it to?

366
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
In my case,

367
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,000
there's still downtown.

368
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
But I...

369
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
But I...

370
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
But I...

371
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
But I...

372
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
But I...

373
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
But I'll change it to Machan-Hama-chan when I'm 30.

374
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
When I'm 30,

375
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I'll change it to Kurohyo.

376
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Don't talk!

377
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Why do you keep saying Kurohyo?

378
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
That's not cool.

379
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Who are you talking to?

380
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Kurohyo?

381
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
You're not 30 yet.

382
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I'll tell you when I'm 30.

383
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Have you thought of something?

384
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
What is it?

385
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Poison scorpion.

386
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
You're a pervert.

387
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Why didn't you say it sooner?

388
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I said poison scorpion.

389
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
That's not cool.

390
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Downtown's Kurohyo and poison scorpion.

391
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
That's not cool.

392
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
It'll go poof!

393
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
It will?

394
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Who will?

395
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
The fluttering part around the pillow...

396
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
It's the cover!

397
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
When you buy it at a futon shop, they sell that.

398
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
So everyone buys a cover and puts it on.

399
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,000
But at the time of sale, the pillow is already like this.

400
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
From the moment it's like this, does it have a cover?

401
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
It does, right?

402
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I don't think so.

403
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Why?

404
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
There are some that don't have it, and some that do.

405
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Not all of them have it.

406
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
But still, it's a cover.

407
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:53,000
The one with the fluttering part is usually a male.

408
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
And the one without it is a female.

409
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
What?

410
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
You think a fluttering part is a female because it looks like one, right?

411
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
That's not true.

412
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
The one with it is a male.

413
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
The one without it is a female.

414
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
The one with it is a female.

415
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
It's a cover.

416
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
You are such a fool.

417
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Is that so?

418
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
The one with it is a female.

419
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
It's a cover.

420
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
It's a cover.

421
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
So Miku...

422
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Who are you talking about?

423
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Where did you get those three?

424
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I tried wearing them.

425
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:52,000
What is the white thing under the nail of your finger?

426
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
It's on the nail.

427
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I don't have it at all.

428
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
See?

429
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
You are such a fool.

430
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
You don't know?

431
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
No, I don't.

432
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Why not?

433
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I can see the bone of your finger clearly.

434
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Wait!

435
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
It doesn't matter because I can see it.

436
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
If you can see it, you can tell how dark it is.

437
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
What do you mean by that?

438
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I know it so well.

439
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
It's the same as a pot.

440
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
What do you mean?

441
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
It doesn't matter because I can see it.

442
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Does it matter?

443
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Does it matter?

444
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
That means you don't have a bone.

445
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I do.

446
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
That means you don't have a bone.

447
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
I don't have a bone.

448
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Happy birthday to you.

449
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Happy birthday to you.

450
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I'm so embarrassed.

451
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Let's sing at least until the end.

452
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Happy birthday to you.

453
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Happy birthday to you.

454
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
That's great.

455
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Thank you very much.

456
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Are you watching Fuji TV?

457
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
This is the birthday cake.

458
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
He is sleeping.

459
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
He is sleeping.

460
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Hitoshi.

461
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Hitoshi.

462
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Hitoshi.

463
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Congratulations.

464
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Hitoshi, can you calm down?

465
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
How many times have you been on this show?

466
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
How many times have you been on this show?

467
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Four times.

468
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Four times.

469
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Did you start when you were 26?

470
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Yes.

471
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
If you do this, I'll hit you.

472
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
I've never done that.

473
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Actually, I have a present for you.

474
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
What is it?

475
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
What is this?

476
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
It's a water bottle for Sugata.

477
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
It's from Yamazaki.

478
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Is that so?

479
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
A toast.

480
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
A toast.

481
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
A toast.

482
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Keep up the good work.
