1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
I'm in front of the Fuzigaoka station of the Tokyo Expressway.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
You asked for my autograph, right?

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
You asked me to come here.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I'm going here today.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
It's a student dormitory for female college students.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I've been waiting for a long time.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Who is this person?

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I won't get caught.

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
When I'm dressed like this, it's the hardest thing not to get caught.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Being left behind is the hardest thing.

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I can't move at all.

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I've been told not to shoot the camera.

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I can't shoot the camera.

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I don't know if I'm going to get caught.

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I thought I'd get in trouble.

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I was told that I was an ASMR-maniac.

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Is that so?

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm going.

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm going to be mislead.

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm going to be mislead.

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Go away.

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm acting with my face.

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
That's right.

24
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
That's it for today.

25
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
We don't have a student dormitory in downtown.

26
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
That's it for today.

27
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
This program is brought to you by

28
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Oyama International Products

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Sponsored by

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
She's here.

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
She gave me a postcard.

32
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I've been waiting for a long time.

33
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
What's your name?

34
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm Miiki Okano.

35
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Men are forbidden here, right?

36
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
My father can't get in.

37
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Your father has never been in.

38
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Open the fridge.

39
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
What is it?

40
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
It's funny.

41
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
What is it?

42
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
You're hiding something.

43
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
You're cutting people up and putting them in.

44
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Stop it.

45
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
It's funny.

46
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
What is it?

47
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Where are you putting your underwear?

48
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
It's a secret.

49
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I'm sure you're looking for it.

50
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Don't look for it.

51
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I'm looking for it in the trash.

52
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
There's a trace of powder.

53
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
When you were having a meeting,

54
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I already put my underwear in your pants.

55
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
That's not true.

56
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Wait a minute.

57
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Look at this.

58
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Don't do that.

59
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I'm editing here.

60
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Don't do that.

61
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
That's terrible.

62
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I'm editing here.

63
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
What do you hate?

64
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I'm going to take Miiki to the cafeteria.

65
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Miuki, come here.

66
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Miuki, come here.

67
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Wait a minute.

68
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
What about the postcard?

69
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
The postcard.

70
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
In the middle.

71
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I got a postcard.

72
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
It's here.

73
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
What is it?

74
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I heard that you're looking for a group.

75
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I heard that you're looking for a group.

76
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I'd like you to come to our student conference.

77
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I'd like you to come to our student conference.

78
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I wrote a lot of things.

79
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
There's a lobby and a large dining room floor.

80
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
There's a lobby and a large dining room floor.

81
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
It's perfect size for a joke.

82
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
It's a lie.

83
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
It's not a big deal.

84
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
You guys are being a joke.

85
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
No, I'm serious.

86
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
You're asking me to come.

87
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
There are many people who come in January.

88
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I'd like you to come in February.

89
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
This is a big problem.

90
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I'm going to be a joke.

91
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I'm going to be a joke.

92
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Miuki has come to the room.

93
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Miuki has come to the room.

94
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Everyone's room is the same.

95
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Everyone's room is the same.

96
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I opened it up.

97
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
My ruler came out of the drawer.

98
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
My ruler came out of the drawer.

99
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
It was a thermometer.

100
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
It was a thermometer.

101
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I brought my underwear.

102
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
This is a lie, isn't it?

103
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
This is a lie, isn't it?

104
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Thank you very much.

105
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Thank you very much.

106
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Where are you going to see me today?

107
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
You're here.

108
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Please sit down.

109
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Please sit down.

110
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Please sit down.

111
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
It's a student dormitory.

112
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
It's a student dormitory.

113
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I've never been to such a place before.

114
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I got there immediately when I went through the entrance.

115
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I saw everyone's works.

116
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I saw everyone's works.

117
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
304...

118
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
50...

119
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I couldn't remember the number.

120
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I wrote down the names.

121
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I wrote down the names.

122
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I put a yellow pen in.

123
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I put a yellow pen in.

124
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
There was something like a yellow button in there.

125
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
And it says that the cleaning is done.

126
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
The green button.

127
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
So when I came back, I saw the yellow letter.

128
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Amazing.

129
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
It's like a happy yellow handkerchief.

130
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
It's really well made.

131
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:27,000
But there are some strange men around here, right?

132
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Around here?

133
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Like a pant thief.

134
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,000
When you become like that, what can you do with an old man like that?

135
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Just in case...

136
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
The room...

137
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Poor guy.

138
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Isn't that true?

139
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Where did you get that?

140
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
When I saw it, I was surprised.

141
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Right?

142
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Right?

143
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I took a survey earlier.

144
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I saw a lot of things.

145
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Everyone is pretty serious.

146
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I thought you were doing a lot more.

147
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Let's take a look.

148
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
What's your name?

149
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
He's my manager.

150
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I'm Nitta Atsuo.

151
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I'm from the production department of Yoshimoto Kogyo.

152
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
This is not pitiful.

153
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Even if you know it's hard, you should do it.

154
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Right.

155
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
His boyfriend is...

156
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
He's looking for a girlfriend.

157
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Is he serious?

158
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
He's looking for a girlfriend.

159
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
What do you think?

160
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Take off your mask.

161
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Take off your mask.

162
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I have this.

163
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
It's okay. Take off your mask.

164
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
What do you think?

165
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
What are you talking about?

166
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
He's my manager.

167
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
What do you think?

168
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
What are you talking about?

169
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Please think about it.

170
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Please write it down.

171
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I took a survey.

172
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I saw a lot of things.

173
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I'll show you some of them.

174
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,000
If you could make three wishes come true, what would you like to do?

175
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I want to fly in the sky.

176
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
You want to fly in the sky?

177
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I can't fly.

178
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
This is the world of Miyuki Nakajima.

179
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,000
A prince riding on a horse wearing white tights appears.

180
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Does it hurt?

181
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Who wrote this?

182
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:34,000
The prince is wearing tights.

183
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
It's a bit different.

184
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
It's a bit different.

185
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
It's tights.

186
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I want you to be impressed.

187
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I think this is good.

188
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
And...

189
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
What is your experience as a man?

190
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I've never seen it with one hand.

191
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
You're good.

192
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I've never seen it with one hand.

193
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I don't have a yakuza.

194
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I'm like B.

195
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
He's underestimating me.

196
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
He's underestimating me.

197
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
What do you imagine as downtown?

198
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Garakuta.

199
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Come here.

200
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
He's underestimating me.

201
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Think about it.

202
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
A sinner...

203
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
No.

204
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
You're the worst.

205
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
You're the worst.

206
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I don't have any complaints about you.

207
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Why?

208
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I don't have any complaints about you.

209
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
It's very comfortable.

210
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I don't have any complaints about you.

211
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I've just said hello to you.

212
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,000
But you're talking like an ectoplasm.

213
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I'm going to kill you.

214
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
What do you want to do if you can make your wish come true?

215
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I want to be a match girl.

216
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
That's good.

217
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
That's good.

218
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I want to be Hama-chan's child.

219
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
What is that?

220
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,000
What is that?

221
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
You're wearing thick underwear.

222
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
From Godzilla.

223
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
What kind of underwear are you wearing from Godzilla?

224
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Where are you drawing Godzilla?

225
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
All of them?

226
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Is this part of Godzilla's mouth?

227
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
A small Godzilla is drawing a lot.

228
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
It's very comfortable.

229
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
It's a Godzilla.

230
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
It's a Godzilla.

231
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
It's a Godzilla.

232
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
It's a small Godzilla.

233
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
What did you just say?

234
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
It's a small Godzilla.

235
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Everyone has a family.

236
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
No.

237
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
No.

238
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I don't know if this girl is real or not.

239
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
There are 22 men.

240
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
That's amazing.

241
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
That's amazing.

242
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I looked at all the surveys.

243
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Most of them said there were zero men.

244
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Of course, there are the most men.

245
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
There are only one or two men who said they had experience.

246
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
There are 22 men.

247
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
That's amazing.

248
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
This is the first time I've been told this.

249
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
This is a foreigner.

250
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
You're a foreigner.

251
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
It's you.

252
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
It's you.

253
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

254
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
You don't understand at all?

255
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
You're not Japanese.

256
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
You're a foreigner.

257
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
You're a Japanese.

258
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
You're a Japanese.

259
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
You're a foreigner.

260
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,000
You speak a little Japanese.

261
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
What's your nationality?

262
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Where are you from?

263
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
From Afghanistan.

264
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Where?

265
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Afghanistan.

266
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
You're from Afghanistan.

267
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
That's amazing.

268
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
What's your name?

269
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,000
My name is Freebo.

270
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Freebo?

271
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Fever?

272
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
That's not it.

273
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Say Freebo.

274
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Freebo.

275
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Ferrybo.

276
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Ferrybo.

277
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Let me introduce you to the people who have been watching this program.

278
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
There are quite a few.

279
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
You have to watch it properly.

280
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
That's not it.

281
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Freebo.

282
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Let me introduce you to the people who have been watching this program.

283
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
There are quite a few.

284
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
There are quite a few.

285
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Let me introduce you to the people who have been watching this program.

286
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
This person is from Kanagawa Prefecture.

287
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:24,000
He appeared before the TV program on Monday.

288
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:30,000
He appeared alongside with the Takahashi brothers.

289
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
It might check out.

290
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
They look alike.

291
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
You don't like being with the Takahashi brothers, do you?

292
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
They seem to be comparable.

293
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:49,000
The Takahashi brothers will take a break, and we will stand in their place.

294
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
We will stand in their place?

295
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Yes.

296
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
We will dress up?

297
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Yes, we will dress up.

298
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
What do you think?

299
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I don't think this will be a punishment game.

300
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I think it will be quite interesting.

301
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Quite interesting?

302
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
For those who are watching.

303
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
This is...

304
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Why are you guys there?

305
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
If we can do this, I would like to try it.

306
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:15,000
There are a lot of punishment games, but we have to decide who will win and who will lose.

307
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
What do you think about this?

308
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,000
According to what I heard, there will be a person who will be the last one.

309
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Who will be the next one?

310
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
There will be a person who will be the last one.

311
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,000
It seems that there is a secret to know the order, but I don't know yet.

312
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Really?

313
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:37,000
We have to guess who will be the last one, and the person who loses will be punished.

314
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I see.

315
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
What?

316
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
You have to see it once.

317
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
By the way, this week it was Masuo.

318
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
What?

319
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
To what extent?

320
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Do you have a family?

321
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Do you have a Hanazawa family?

322
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
No, I don't have a family.

323
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Look, this is the story of the Isono family.

324
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
It has nothing to do with Hanazawa family.

325
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Is that so?

326
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
He is just a servant.

327
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Who is it?

328
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
For the time being.

329
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
It's Masuo, right?

330
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Yes.

331
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Yes.

332
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I think it's Fune.

333
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Somehow.

334
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
No, I think it's Katsuo.

335
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
That's right.

336
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
We have to decide which one.

337
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Let's think about the punishment game.

338
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
That's it.

339
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I want to hear about this article.

340
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
It's the spirit of the marathon.

341
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
For example, two people participated in the Honolulu marathon a year ago.

342
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Of course, the TV station forced them to run.

343
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Two people ran.

344
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Hama-chan was down at 15 kilometers per hour.

345
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Masuo-chan burned all the energy in his body and dried it.

346
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
It was an eight-and-a-half-hour marathon.

347
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
It's the spirit of the marathon.

348
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
It's true.

349
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Wait a minute.

350
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I have something to say.

351
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
It's not a dry run.

352
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
It's a dry run.

353
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
But even if I say it, it's dry.

354
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
It's a dry run.

355
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
You were really useless.

356
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I was pathetic at that time.

357
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
A person who hasn't been exercising for a long time ran up to 15 kilometers.

358
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
His knees are lower than before.

359
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I can run even if I drop 15 kilometers.

360
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Then you run 15 kilometers.

361
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
What?

362
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
10 kilometers is a good pace.

363
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Can you do it?

364
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Yes.

365
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
If I run 12 or 13 kilometers, I can't move forward.

366
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I can't run like an old man and an old woman.

367
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I can't run like an old man and an old woman.

368
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I ran 15 kilometers in front of the Diamond Head.

369
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Are you kidding me?

370
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I can run 15 kilometers every morning.

371
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
You can't run.

372
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
You've never exercised.

373
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I can run.

374
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I can run up to here.

375
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
You can run.

376
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
You don't like to ride a train.

377
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I ran 246 kilometers all the time.

378
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
You don't run.

379
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Do you want to do something?

380
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I don't care.

381
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
What do you want to do?

382
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I don't care.

383
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Let's run a marathon.

384
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Let's run 15 kilometers lightly.

385
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Let's run a marathon on this program.

386
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Let's gather all the fans who want to run with us.

387
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Let's run a marathon.

388
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Let's do it.

389
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Let's run a marathon.

390
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
You...

391
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
You were making a lot of noise.

392
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Why did you make a noise?

393
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I want to do something for people.

394
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
What are you talking about?

395
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I want to give a sponge to people.

396
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I want to give a sponge to people.

397
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
You want to give a sponge to people who run?

398
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I want to give a sponge to people.

399
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I want to give a sponge to people.

400
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Who want to give a sponge to people?

401
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I will do it.

402
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I want to do it.

403
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I will do it.

404
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
It doesn't matter.

405
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I can run fast.

406
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I will do it before I reach the goal.

407
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I will wait for the goal from the previous run.

408
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I can't take a picture with the camera because it's too fast.

409
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I can put as many as you want.

410
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I'm more confident with the water painting.

411
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Oh, you can do it with the water painting.

412
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I'm good at water painting.

413
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I have a lot of friends in the car.

414
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I used to go to Triathlon.

415
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I've been to Triathlon in Osaka.

416
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Mr. Ike. Mr. Ikeda.

417
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Mr. Ikeda was 47 years old and Mr. Ikeda was 25 years old.

418
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Mr. Ikeda and Mr. Ikeda trained together for a long time.

419
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I was very impressed.

420
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
When I approached the goal, everyone was crying.

421
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
When I was very impressed, I said,

422
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Mr. Ikeda, come here.

423
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
The goal is a little further.

424
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
There was a tape of the goal.

425
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Mr. Ikeda, come here.

426
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Everyone was crying.

427
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Everyone was saying, oh, my God.

428
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I was very impressed.

429
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
He was cutting the tape.

430
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I was very impressed.

431
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
That's it.

432
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,000
But it was the first time I was interviewed like this.

433
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Everyone has to be able to imitate it a little more.

434
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
It's sad.

435
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I'm one of the five imitators.

436
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
This is the last one.

437
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,000
There are 108 imitations.

438
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
The 74th one.

439
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
What?

440
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
The 74th one.

441
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
This is Takeda Tette.

442
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
The 74th one of the 108 imitations is Takeda Tette.

443
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Everyone, listen carefully.

444
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,000
This is how you imitate something that makes money.

445
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Good luck.

446
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
What?

447
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I'm out of breath now.

448
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Why are your eyes white when you do this?

449
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
This is Takeda Tette.

450
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Is that so?

451
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Is that so?

452
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Takeda Tette was looking at me like this with his eyes white.

453
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
That's right.

454
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
The 74th one.

455
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
What?

456
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:46,000
What is the number of the 108th one of the 108 imitations?

457
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Number eight.

458
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Number eight?

459
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
That's a young number.

460
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Did you remember that early?

461
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Yes.

462
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Number eight.

463
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
That's a young number.

464
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
This is the new one.

465
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
The new one?

466
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
The first one.

467
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
The first one.

468
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
What number is that?

469
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:14,000
This is the 108th one.

470
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
There were 108 before.

471
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
What?

472
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
There were 108 before.

473
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
This is the 109th one.

474
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
What?

475
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
This is a lie.

476
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
This is a lie.

477
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
This is the new one.

478
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Hey!

479
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Kato Shimura!

480
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
I'm sorry.

481
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
What?

482
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
What?

483
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
What?

484
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
I got it now.

485
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
What is the number of the 109th one?

486
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Let's think seriously about this.

487
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
What?

488
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:54,000
People who are good at imitations, or people who are good at imitations,

489
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
rather than saying their names,

490
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
I don't do that.

491
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Kato Shimura, you know who he is, right?

492
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
But he never said the name of Ikariya Chousuke.

493
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
But that's what Kato Shimura said.

494
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
That's what's amazing.

495
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,000
He just said that it's frustrating to make Saigo Hideki.

496
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
No one said Saigo Hideki.

497
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
It doesn't matter if it's true or not.

498
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
It would have been better if he didn't say Takeda Tetsuya.

499
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
That's right.

500
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Even if you don't do it, you'll know.

501
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Even if you don't say your name, you can do it.

502
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
You'll know who it is.

503
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Well...

504
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Well, somehow...

505
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
When did you...

506
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
That's Sakurai Joichiro, right?

507
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
I don't know him.

508
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Sakurai Joichiro used to do it a long time ago.

509
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Morishige Hisa?

510
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Morishige Hisa.

511
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Who told you to collapse?

512
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
It's already time.

513
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Oh, really?

514
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Yes, really.

515
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Thank you very much.

516
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Thank you very much.

517
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Thank you very much.

518
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Thank you very much, everyone.

519
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
How was it?

520
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Did you have any clients?

521
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Are you asking me?

522
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Yeah.

523
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Who told you to collapse?

524
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,000
I'm not in the right direction right now.

525
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
What are you talking about?

526
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
What are you talking about?

527
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I'm going to quit a lot of things.

528
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Marathon.

529
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
What?

530
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
What are you going to do?

531
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
What about the marathon?

532
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Marathon?

533
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Yeah.

534
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
I don't want to go to the marathon anymore.

535
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Really.

536
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Who do you think you are?

537
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Are you popular?

538
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Why are you talking about the marathon?

539
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Are you a marathon person?

540
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
It's boring.

541
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
I'm a three-distance runner.

542
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Wait a minute.

543
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
It's a short distance.

544
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,000
But I can run lightly up to 15 kilometers.

545
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
No, no.

546
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Let's have a three-distance race.

547
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Let's do that.

548
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
50 meters.

549
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
I've ever grabbed a cheetah's tail.

550
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Where is it?

551
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Where do you want to go?

552
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
I've ever grabbed a cheetah's tail.

553
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
That's why.

554
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Where can you do that?

555
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
I'd like to go to see a lot of things again.

556
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
I'll do it on my way.

557
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
This comedy is big.

558
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I think there will be a lot of battles like this.

559
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
I'm sleeping.

560
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
What are you talking about?

561
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
I'm sorry.

562
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:33,000
I'll go to your place again.

563
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
What are you talking about?

564
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
I'm sorry.

565
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
I'm sorry.

566
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
I'll go to your place again.

567
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Goodbye.

568
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
See you next week.

569
00:23:40,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Goodbye.
